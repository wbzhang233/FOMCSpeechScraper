            "content": "Longer -term Considerations for Growth and Monetary Policy  \nRemarks by  \nJeff Schmid  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovember 19, 2024  \nDelivered at the Omaha Chamber of C ommerce Economic Outlook Forum  \nOmaha, Nebraska  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Thank you for having me today, it is great to be back in Omaha and I look forward to our \ndiscussion . The Kansas City Fed covers a seven -state region comprising roughly 20 million \npeople and  a large portion of the middle of the country.  In addition to Kansas City, we rely on \noffices in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Omaha to cover such a large and diverse geography.  \nThese offices play a vital role in all the Federal Reserve’s three primary mission areas.   \nAs you likely know , the first of these mission areas is monetary policy, which people are \noften most familiar with due to the broad effects that changes in interest rates have across \nbusinesses and households . I will spend most of my time addressing monetary policy  today. In \naddition, the Federal Reserve is also a regulator of commercial banks, with supervisory \nresponsibilities for banks that have a state charter and are members of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. Lastly, the Federal Reserve is heavily involved in supporting national initiatives related \nto payments and financial services, including work for the U.S. Treasury.  \nI want to share this context with all of you as a way to specifically highlight the important \nwork and footprint of our Omaha office and the 150 employees who work here in support of \nthese functions. For example, we have staff, under the leadership of Branch Executive Nate \nKauffman  and others who are  in attendance today, who conduct research and connect with many \nof you in an effort to understand economic developments that are useful when informing broader \ndiscussions about monetary policy. We also have a n umber of bank examiners and other \nindividuals working to ensure the stability of banks and the financial system throughout the state \nof Nebraska.  \nPerhaps most unique to our Omaha office, however, is work that we do on behalf of the \nU.S. Treasury to support our service men and women stationed on bases or ships throughout the \nworld . Today, the Kansas City Fed  has nearly 100 employees in Omaha who build, manage and \nmaintain a program  known as \"Stored Value Card ,” which is focused on displacing  the use of \nphysical cash at military locations and on naval ships, which, as you might imagine, can carry \nsignificant risks in certain parts of the world. The development of this stored value card solution \nprovides an easy a nd efficient end -to-end financial transaction system that can be used by our \nmilitary in the most austere locations.   \n \n \n \n\n2 \n Growth and Monetary Policy  \nFor most of my time today , I want to take a step  back to focus on a few longer -term \ntrends that will shape the environment for monetary policy in the coming years : \n• First, technology and productivity growth, and the role that energy can play as \neither an enabler or constraint.  \n• Second, demographics and projections for the size of the workforce.  \n• And third, the growth of government debt, both in the United States and abroad .  \nAll three of these factors leave an imprint on monetary policy, not so much for the \nmeeting -to-meeting interest rate decisions of the Fed eral Open Market Committee , but more for \nwhere interest rates will settle over time .  \nBut before gazing into the crystal ball, let’s look back at the FOMC’s decision  earlier this \nmonth . During its November meeting , the FOMC cut its policy rate by a ¼ percentage point, \nfollowing a ½ point cut in September.  These cuts came after a  year of holding rates flat  and, \nbefore that , a rapid increase in rates as the Fed moved to address the spike in inflation  that \nfollowed the pandemic.  The decision to lower rates  is an acknowledgement of the Committee’s \ngrowing confidence that inflation is on a path to reach the Fed’s 2 % objective —a confidence \nbased  in part  on signs that both labor and product markets ha ve come into better balance in \nrecent months.  While now is the time to begin dialing back the restrictiveness of monetary \npolicy , it remains to be seen how much further interest rates will decline or where they might \neventually settle.   \n \nProductivity , Technology, and Energy    \nThe first long -run factor I will review is productivity.  Productivity determines how \nefficient an economy is at producing goods and services with a given quantity of materials and \nlabor.  A more productive economy allows for both strong growth  and moderate inflation —a \nwinning combination —and is the key determinant of sustained increases in living standards. \nStrong productivity growth can also lead to  relatively high equilibrium interest rate s by \nstrengthening  investment demand and support ing consumption.   \nRecent productivity growth has been solid.  Labor productivity, or the amount of output \nproduced with one hour of work, has increased at an average 2.5% pace for  the past year -and-a \n\n3 \n half, more than twice as fast as in the decade prior to the pandemic.  In part , this pick up could be \na temporary boost as some factors that have depressed productivity fade . The historically tight \nlabor market of 2022 and 2023 , and the high number of open positions,  led to a record number of \nworkers quitting their current job for something new . While in the long run, having workers in \njobs that are a better match to their abilities and desires  can boost productivity, in the short -run, \nturnover decreases the skill of the workforce and results in higher training costs .1 With the labor \nmarket cooling this year, workers are no longer quitting  at an elevated pace , and labor market \nchurn has fallen off dramatically, leading to  at least a temporary  increase  in productivity.    \nBut perhaps the most important  and persist ent changes in productivity typically arise \nfrom technological advancements.  Of course, there is much excitement about artificial \nintelligence, or AI . The excitement around AI is high , and the massive  investments being made \nsuggest that the expected productivity gains from the technology must be enormous.  While the \nfull potential remains uncertain, AI appears set to change the way people work and interact .  \nOne aspect of AI that cannot be overlooked is its interaction with the energy economy.  \nLast week, the Kansas City Fed along with the Dallas Fed hosted an Energy symposium where a \nmain topic of discussion was the resurgent growth in power demand.  AI is an  energy intensive \ntechnology , and will likely influence and reshape energy markets, especially for electricity.   \nThe growth of AI and data centers is already having a significant impact on the market \nfor electricity . Demand for electricity in the United States  has grown at a 1.3 % pace over the past \nthree years, more than twice as fast as in the decade before the pandemic.  Research at the Kansas \nCity Fed highlights that this recent surge in demand has been concentrated in a few key states  \nwhere the rapid expansion of data centers has been a major contributor to rising electricity use.2 \nTwo states  in the Tenth District , Nebraska and Wyoming, have experienced a big jump in \ncommercial electricity use since the beginning of this year, likely spurred by major projects by \nlarge tech firms . While data centers are just one piece of the puzzle, their rapid expansion \nillustrates the broader transformation taking place across industries that rely heavily on digital \ninfrastructure, including AI and cloud computing. These developments highlight the critical role \n \n1 Sly, Nicholas. “ Is Remote Work Turning the Screw on Labor Market Tightness? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity Rocky Mountain Economist , Sept. 22, 2022.  \n2 Çakır Melek, Nida, and Gallin, Alex. \" Powering Up: The Surging Demand for Electricity .\" Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas City Economic Bulletin , September 25, 2024.  \n\n4 \n electricity will play in driving future economic growth, both in our districts and across the \nnation.   \nMore generally , what we are seeing is an increase in  U.S. electricity intensity —the \namount of electricity used per unit of GDP. Historically, the U.S. economy has grown more \nenergy -efficient, with electricity intensity declining since the early 1990s, reflecting \ntechnological advancements, energy -efficient practices, and structural shifts in the economy. \nHowever, this trend appears set to  reverse as the economy becomes more electrified.  \nEven as these trends point to an increasing digital and electrified economy, they also \npresent challenges. One of the key constraints we now face is ensuring that energy infrastructure \ncan keep pace with this accelerating demand. The adoption of advanced t echnologies like AI, \nautomation, and data centers, while crucial for maintaining economic competitiveness, has \ncreated significant strains on our energy systems. Without sufficient investment in power \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution networks, th e ongoing surge in electricity demand \ncould result in  supply constraints  that potentially slow economic growth.  \n \nDemographics  \nThe second long-term factor I would like to focus on  is demographics.  Population trends \nare generally slow -moving and predictable, and here the outlook is not supportive of growth.  \nFrom the end of World War II until the present, the working age population of the United States \nincreased by about 100 million potential workers.  However, from this year until the end of the \ncentury, projections have only about 10 million new potential workers joining the labor force.  We \nare transitioning from a period where the number of workers  in the United States  increased \nrapidly, to a future where there is almost no increase in the workforce.  This is n ot a recipe for \nstrong growth.   \nAnd it is not just the United States.  The growth rate of the global population is expected \nto decline steadily to zero by the end of the century , and projections for some  individual \ncountries are stunning.  Most notably, after increasing by close to 1 billion people from 1950 to \nnow, the population of China is expected to shrink by almost 1 billion people by the end of the \ncentury.  As the world population ages, both in the United States and globally, there will be fewer \nworkers , which reduces demand for physical capital and investment, depressing interest rates. \n\n5 \n Older populations also save more, which can further push down interest rates. This is to say that \ndemographic trends are likely to put downward pressure on interest rates.   \n \nDeficits and Debt  \nThe third long -term factor I would like to discuss is the  tremendous growth of \ngovernment debt , both in the United States and globally . And here I would like to reiterate some \npoints that I made in May at a speech delivered at the Kansas City Fed’s Agricultural Summit in \nOmaha .3 \nPrior to the pandemic, one often -cited explanation for the relatively low interest rates of \nthe period was high demand for safe assets, including government debt, relative to the supply of \nthose assets.  Increased demand from financial institutions as well as strong growth in China and \nemerging markets had boosted demand for such assets, bidding up their price and holding down \ninterest rates across the yield curve.   \nHowever, now this demand has cooled , even as the supply of government debt has \njumped and is expected to continue growing at a very rapid rate.  As such, it is possible that the \nbalance of demand and supply for government debt will shift from a factor holding down interest \nrates to a factor boosting interest rates.  \nImportantly, shifts in supply and demand for safe assets influence interest rates \nindependent of the Fed’s actions. Though the Fed is not a passive bystander and plays a role in \nsetting short -term interest rates, it can’t perpetually deviate rates from mar ket forces without \nrisking its mandates for maximum employment and price stability. In this way, the Fed takes \nfiscal decisions as given and steers monetary policy in the appropriate direction to achieve its \ndual mandate.  \nAs I said in May , large fiscal deficits will not be inflationary because the Fed will do its \njob and achieve its inflation objective, though in doing so , the outcome could be persistently \nhigher interest rates.  This relationship is also at the crux of the rationale for the political \nindependence of the central bank.  Political authorities could very well prefer that deficits not \nlead to higher interest rates, but history has shown that following through on this impulse has \noften resulted in higher inflation.  An independent central bank insulated from immediate political \n \n3 Schmid, Jeff. “ The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy .” Remarks at the Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City’s Agricultural Summit. May 14, 2024 . \n\n6 \n pressure and guided by a clear inflation objective has historically been an effective means for \nachieving and maintaining low and stable inflation.   \n \nConclusion  \nI have discussed three long -term trends today : productivity, demographics, and debt.  All \nthree have implications for the long -run path of monetary policy, interest rates, and growth , but \nin different  direction s. Faster productivity growth could lead to relative ly high interest rates and \nhigh growth ; demographic trends point to low interest rates and slow growth ; while debt \ndynamics suggest a combination of high interest rates and slow growth.  All three factors are \nlikely to be in effect, and the outcome for interest rates and the economy  will be determined by \nthe balance between them . As an optimist,  my hope is that productivity growth can outrun both \ndemographics and debt . But as a central banker, I will not let my enthusiasm get ahead of the \ndata or my commitment to the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and full employment."

This is one of my favorite events of the year. It is \nalways a pleasure  to work closely with our Dallas colleagues , and the insights gained  from this \nevent are extremely  valuable.  \nThe energy industry is part of the Kansas City Fed  District’s economic DNA. The District \naccounts  for roughly 9% of U.S. crude oil production , 14% of natural gas production , and 43% \nof coal production . Like Texas, the Tenth District also outpaces the United States in renewable  \nenergy . Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are some of the windiest states in the country , and \nColorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming are some of the sunniest. Pipelines and oil storage in \nCushing , Oklahoma , are vital infrastructure , and many District  manufactur ers support  oil and gas \nfirms, as well as the renewable energy sector. Furthermore, the region’s important agricultural \nsector is interwoven with the energy economy , suppl ying feedstocks to regional biofuel plants  \nand producing renewable ethanol and biodiesel.  \nIn my remarks , I want to take a step  back to focus on a few longer -term trends that will \nshape the environment for monetary policy in the coming years : \n \n• First, technology and productivity growth, and the role that energy can play as \neither an enabler or constraint ; \n• Second, demographics and projections for the size of the workforce ; \n• And third, the growth of government debt, both in the United States and abroad .  \n \nAll three of these factors leave an imprint on monetary policy, not so much for the \nmeeting -to-meeting interest rate decisions of the Fed eral Open Market Committee , but more for \nwhere interest rates will settle over time .   \nBut before gazing into the crystal ball, let’s look back at the FOMC’s decision last week .  \nOn Thursday, the FOMC cut its policy rate by a ¼ percentage point, following a ½ point cut in \nSeptember.

The numbers are clear, especiallly  with \n \n1Sly, Nicholas. “ Is Remote Work Turning the Screw on Labor Market Tightness? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity Rocky Mountain Economist, Sept. 22, 2022.  \n2 See “ Oil Was Written Off.

I will offer some remarks on the outlook for \nthe economy and monetary policy , and then I look forward to any questions you may have.  \nAt its meeting in September, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) lowered its \npolicy interest rate by ½ percentage point to a range between 4¾ percent and 5 percent.  This was \nthe first change in the policy rate in over a year and came about five years after the Fed last \nstarted a rate cutting cycle . But a lot has happened in those five years . After gradually lowering \nrates in the second half of 2019, the Fed  quickly dropped rates to zero  with the outbreak of the \npandemic . Only two years later, with inflation on its way to a  multi -decade high, the Fed \nembarked on the fast est tightening cycle of the modern era, pushing up rates 525 basis points \nover the course of a year -and-a-half. In the context of these outsized  moves, one may wonder \nwhat the future holds now that monetary policy has reached a new inflection point .  \nMy hope is for what I might call a more normalized cycle.  A cycle where the Fed engages \nin modest adjustments to  policy to keep the economy on an even keel of steady growth, stable \nprices, and full employment.  Absent any major shocks , I am optimistic that we can achieve such \na cycle, but I believe it will  take a cautious and gradual approach to policy.  While I support \ndialing back the restrictiveness of policy, my preference would be to avoid outsized moves, \nespecially given uncertainty over the eventual destination of policy and my desire to avoid \ncontributing to financial market volatility. In the remainder of my remarks, I will first discuss \nwhy now is the right time to start lowering rates . Then I will turn  to how low  rates might  go and \nhow quickly they should get there.   \n \nHow We Got Here  \nIn my view, it only bec ame appropriate to lower the policy rate after inflation \nconvincingly appeared to be on a persistent path towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective . Since \n2022, inflation has been the main plotline in the monetary policy narrative , and understandably \nso as prices surged at a pace not seen since the 1980s . More recently, we have seen considerable \nprogress in returning inflation to the Fed’s objective, with prices increasing  2.2 percent in the \nyear ending in August . I would not be comfortable lowering the policy rate if I w ere not \nreasonably confident that inflation was heading  in the right direction.   \nThere are a couple of factors that have considerably improved the outlook for inflation in \nrecent months.   \n\n2 \n First, the pandemic -related disruptions  that led to  the initial burst of inflation now appear \nto be largely behind us . This is especially true for the price of goods. It was a jump in goods \nprices  that provided much of the initial impetus for the surge in inflation,  but that impulse has \nbeen absent for over a year now.  In fact, over the past 12 months , goods prices have declined  \nalmost 1  percent.   \nThe fading of goods inflation reflects  developments in  both supply and demand . During \nthe pandemic, the supply of goods was lowered by production disruptions and logistical snarls . \nAt the same time , demand for goods surged as homebound consumers shifted spending away \nfrom services.  This imbalance between  low supply and high demand led to rapid price increases.  \nHowever  more recently , supply chains have recovered, the mix between goods and services \nconsumption has returned to pre -pandemic patterns, and goods prices are no longer a source of \ninflation.   \nA second factor increasing my confidence that the  easing of inflation will persist is the  \nloosening of the labor market.  The pandemic led to severe disruptions in the labor market, \ncontributing to historic tightness, and increasing pressure on labor -intensive services prices . \nMore recently , the labor market has cooled.  The vacancy ratio  has fallen to about 1 posting per \navailable worker from a historic high of 2 postings per available worker  at the height of labor \nmarket tightness in 2022 . We have also seen the unemployment rate creep up to 4. 1 percent from \n3.4 percent at the start of last year.   \nWhile the loosening of the labor market has led to some concern that the economy is on  \nshaky ground, my read is  that we are seeing a normalization rather than a significant \ndeterioration of conditions.  It might not be surprising that a historically tight labor market would \nbe followed by a period of relatively slack hiring.  When markets were tight and workers were \nquitting positions at a record pace, employers made every effort to retain existing workers and \nhire new workers, fearful that they would be caught short -handed.  Now that employers are \nconfident in their ability to fill  open  positions, they are no longer hoarding labor, easing retention \nefforts, and likely turning back the dial a bit on the aggressiveness of their hiring.  All of this will \nat least temporarily slacken the labor market as employers make these adjustments.   \nWith a variety of data sources and many different ways to view the labor market, I find it \nhelpful to reference the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicator s (LMCI)  for an \noverall view of the health of the labor market.  The LMCI combines 2 4 separate  labor market data \n\n3 \n series into two easy -to-interpret indexes.  Recently the LMCI has been trending down, suggesting \na loosening, but it remains  above its historical average, suggesting the overall labor market \nremains quite healthy.1 \n \nAdjusting Rates: How Low and How Fast?  \nWith the data suggesting inflation is heading in the right direction , there is a compelling \nargument that the policy interest rate should come down . Less certain is how low rates should go  \nand how quickly adjust ment s need to occur .  \nStarting with the first question  of how low interest rates will go, there is ample  evidence \nthat the current stance of monetary policy , and the level of interest rates,  is restrictive, but less \nevidence that it is very restrictive.  Growth remains strong  and the economy has shown continued \nmomentum . Real GDP increased 3 percent in the second quarter  and appears to be poised to \nincrease a similar amount in the third quarter.  Not bad, considering growth average d a little over  \n2 percent in the decade before the pandemic when interest rates were far lower.   \nThe economy has been supported by strong consumer spending, which in turn has been \nsupported by growing labor income and relatively healthy household balance sheets in the \naggregate.  Of course,  not all household balance sheets are healthy, and the aggregate numbers \nmask all the differences across actual households . But to summarize , if the economy does not \nappear to be very restricted, then it seems unlikely that monetary policy is all that restrictive.  \nIt is my belief that interest rates could  settle well above the levels we saw in the decade \nbefore the pandemic.  There are several  reasons why this may be true. One favorable, and some \nmay say optimistic, scenario is that continued strong productivity gains boost economic growth, \nstrengthen investment and support consumption.  Such a combination would increase the demand \nfor investable savings and hence push up interest rates.   \nA less favorable scenario, and one I discussed at length in a speech in May, is that the \ntremendous increase in government debt coming out of the pandemic , not just in the United \nStates  but around the world , maintains upward pressure on  interest rates across the economy.2 \n \n1 More information about the Kansas City Fed’s LMCI is available at https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-\ntrends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ .  \n2 See “The Outlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy” at \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/Speeches/documents/10168/2024 -Schmid-Omaha-05-14.pdf.  \n\n4 \n However, there are some long -run structural factors that likely contributed to the low \nlevel of interest rates before the pandemic , and these factors have not gone away . In particular, \ndemographic trends point to aging populations in the United States and around the world.  As \nolder populations  age into retirement, they  tend to work less, which reduces demand for  physical  \ncapital and invest ment , depressing interest rates . Older populations also  save more,  particularly \nin fixed -income assets, which can further push down interest rates.  Though it is hard to know \nwhich of these factors will dominate  — productivity, debt, or demographics — we must be open \nto the possibility that interest rates will settle higher than we observed before the pandemic.     \nNow let’s turn to the question of timing.  If the Fed is to further lower interest rates, at \nwhat pace should it be done?  Given the uncertainties I just outlined about our eventual \ndestination, a cautious and deliberate course of action seems appropriate. Lowering rates in a \ngradual fashion would provide time to observe  the economy’s reaction to our interest rate \nadjustments  and give us the space to assess at what level interest rates are neither restricting nor \nboosting the economy.  \nA cautious approach will also work to minimize the Fed’s contribution to financial \nmarket volatility.  Outsized policy moves can provoke  outsized financial market reactions to data \nsurprises.  The data are messy and subject to large revisions as we have seen in recent months.  \nOur policy must be linked to the flow of data, but we should avoid putting  too much weight on \nany single  data point . As policymakers we should be flexible , but being nimble can come with a \nprice.  Reacting quickly builds expectations of f urther quick reactions . This  widens the scope for \nfinancial market expectations to diverge from the intent  of the Committee , potentially \ncontributing  to heightened financial market volatility.  Already, we have seen large swings in \nTreasury yields over the past few months  as markets assess and reassess the potential course of \npolicy interest rates.  \n \nThe Impact on the Balance Sheet  \nV olatile interest rates could potentially complicate another aspect of Fed policy , which is  \nour work  to decrease the size of our balance sheet . Following a tremendous expansion during the \npandemic, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet since the middle of 2022.  My preference \nis to shrink the balance sheet as much as possible while remaining consistent with the Fed’s \ncurrent operating framework.  While a larger balance sheet lowers the risk of sharp movements in \n\n5 \n money market interest rates, maintaining a large balance sheet is not without cost s. I am focused \non three costs in my preference for a relatively aggressive approach to balance sheet reduction . \nFirst, a large balance sheet weighs on longer -term yields, d epressing the price of duration \nin financial markets and potentially leading to distortions in the allocation of credit.  It is my view \nthat one factor contributing to the flatness of the yield curve is the large size  and elevated \nduration  of our balance sheet.  The long -term health of the traditional banking industry, which is \nwell represented in my Federal Reserve district , requires a positive slope to the yield curve.  A \nsmaller balance sheet conce ntrated in shorter duration securities would lessen our impact on the \nslope of the yield curve.  Recent research from the Kansas City Fed reviews some of the \nconsiderations around the eventual composition of the Fed’s balance sheet.3 \nSecond, a large balance sheet increases the Fed’s footprint in financial markets, \npotentially diminishing and weakening other mechanisms and markets for distributing liquidity \nacross financial institutions and leading to a more brittle financial system.    \nAnd third, maintaining a large balance sheet can give the uncomfortable impression that \nmonetary and fiscal policy are intertwined. Maintaining an excessively large Treasury portfolio \ncan give the impression that the Fed’s balance sheet is supporting gover nment debt markets.  \nAs we move past the post -pandemic surge in inflation, we have the prospect of \ntransitioning to a more normalized cycle where the Fed regularly recalibrates monetary policy to \nmeet  its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.  I am optimistic the Fed can achieve \nsuch an outcome, but it will take a careful approach that is attentive to the data and signals from \nthe economy.  My beli ef is that a cautious and gradual approach to policy adjustments would be \nbest suited for this uncertain environment.    \n \n \n3 See Sengupta and S mith (2024).  “Considerations for the Longer -Run Maturity Composition of the Federal \nReserve’s Treasury Portfolio” ."

It is an honor  to participate in the Kansas Bankers Association \nannual meeting . You have quite a lineup  of speakers , and I am pleased to be part of such an \nesteemed group.  \nToday, I will speak to some issues of importance to the industry before turning to a \ndiscussion of the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.  \n \nBanking and the 10th District  \nIt is exciting  to see you once again . We were fortunate  to host many of you  in April at the \nKansas City Fed for a Workshop on the Future of Banking , which was also attended by Gov. \nBowman . That event was a recognition  of the importance of banking to the nation’s economy, \nbut even more so  a recognition of  the importance of banks to the Tenth District.  I will say here \nthat the banking industry as a whole in the Tenth District, and specifically in Kansas, is in sound \ncondition as a result of your leadership.   \nOur District is home to a large number of banks,  most of which are small community \nbanks.  An understanding of and connection with community banks has long been part of the \nKansas City Fed’s DNA.  As a former community banker myself, I will continue this tradition.   \nLocally focused banks, with their unique understanding of the challenges and \nopportunities of their communities , play a key financial and civic role across the country, and \nparticularly in the rural geographies that make up much of the Tenth  District.  In serving the \npublic, the Fed has an interest in the health of community banks.  This includes understanding  the \nunique issues facing community banks and work ing to prevent such banks from being \ndisadvantaged relative to other financial institutions.    \nFor this reason, it is important that bank regulators and supervisors take a tailored \napproach to manage the unique risks posed by different institutions. Effective supervision and \nregulation should ensure that the hundreds of regional and community banks in the Tenth District \nare safe and sound. But supervisory and regulatory frameworks should also acknowledge that a \none-size-fits-all approach can come with significant compliance costs and threaten the ability of \ncommunity banks to supply credit and deposi t services to rural households, agricultural \nproducers, and small businesses.  \nIt is also important that regulation not disadvantage smaller banks.  Small banks already \nmaintain, on average, higher capital ratios than larger , more systemic banks.  However, large \n\n2 \n banks continue to enjoy implicit funding subsidies that convey an unfair competitive advantage. \nIt is important that we continue efforts to level the playing field  to enable effective competition \nbetween small banks and larger more systemic institutions . Overall, adequate capital is at the \nheart of the resilience of the banking system.  Since the 2008 financial crisis, the system has \nbecome much better capitalized.  However, given the importance of capital , we should always \nwork to make sure that capital is c ommensurate to the risk, especially for larger systemic \norganizations.   \nThe Fed should also be aware of the challenges that smaller institutions face, especially \nin the context of rapid technological change , which has implications for cost and accessibility . \nOne important development here is the launch of FedNow, the Federal Reserve’s new 24/7/365 \npayment rail.  FedNow is the Fed’s first major new payment rail in over 40 years and aims to \nbring instant payments technology to all financial institutions, no matter their size or location.  \nOur continued commitment to discount window lending modernization is also helpful in \nreducing risks related to bank funding. I applaud the progress we have made to improve banks’ \noperational readiness regarding  discount window access. But I also agree with Dallas Fed \nPresident Lorie Logan’s recent remarks that technological advancements and policy changes can \nfurther assist us in achieving our goal of making the discount window an effective liquidity risk \nmanagement tool.  Bankers also have a role to play and should prioritize their discount window \nreadiness.  A diversified funding stack is essential , and the discount window has a role to play.    \n \nEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \nI would like to turn now to an update on the  current state of the economy  and the outlook \nfor monetary policy.  Next year will be my first rotation as a voting member on the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) , which has  responsibility for setting the Fed’s policy interest rate  \ntarget . With that responsibility comes a need for transparency.  It is important that I explain how I \nview the economy and how that view informs my take on appropriate policy.   \nOf course, my view of the economy is important ly shaped by my connection s and \nconversation s with individuals in the 10th District.  The structure of the Fed, with 12 independent \nregional banks, was designed to collect views and information from across the country . This \ndesign, which has worked well for over 100 years, makes sure that the whole country has a voice \n\n3 \n in monetary policy . The vote on the FOMC is my responsibility, but it is n ot a decision I take in \nisolation . \nIt is helpful to  review where we are now before turning to a more uncertain view of \nwhere we might be going.  Following recent sharp movements in financial markets , it is \nimportant to stress that all discussions of  monetary  policy must be rooted in Congress’s \ninstruction that the Fed pursue a dual mandate of price stability and full employment.  Of course, \nfinancial conditions can both reveal important information on the trajectory of the economy and \ncan also spillover to impact  the real economy.  However, t he Fed has to remain focused on  \nachiev ing its dual  mandate , and i n recent years we have had our work cut out for us.  \nPrice stability is defined as an inflation rate of 2 percent . Inflation at this pace is thought \nto be modest enough not to affect people’s day -to-day decision making . The target is not zero so \nthat the economy has some flexibility for relative prices to adjust over time.  Since 2021 , the Fed \nhas been missing on this part of its mandate , with inflation peaking at a 40 -year high in the \nmiddle of 2022 . Accordingly , the Fed reacted, and quite strongly, increasing the policy interest \nrate 525 basis points over a short period of time  and holding it there for the past year.  \nThe inflation that we have seen over the past few years was caused by an imbalance in \nthe economy, with demand for goods and services outpacing the economy’s ability to supply \nthose goods and services.  In a market economy, when demand exceeds supply, prices go up.    \nBy tightening monetary policy, the Fed’s goal has been to slow the pace of demand \ngrowth to allow supply to catch up, closing the imbalance in the economy and relieving price \npressure.   Demand has eased  and supply has increased, in part as pandemic -related disruptions to \nproduction cleared up.  And inflation has come down, falling from over 7 percent  at its peak to \n2½ percent  by the middle of this year , much closer to our 2 percent objective .  We are close , but \nwe are still not quite there.   \nThe most recent monthly price numbers have also been encouraging, with inflation \neasing across a wide cross section  of goods and services.  Given this data, I am more  confident \nthat inflation is on a path  to return to our target.  But the price data can be volatile, and it is \nstandard practice to look at inflation over longer periods of time to smooth through the monthly \nups and downs.  Given the multi -decade shock to inflation that we have experienced, we should \nbe looking for the worst in the data rather than the best.  However, if inflation continues to come \n\n4 \n in low, my confidence will grow that we are on track to meet the price stability part of our \nmandate, and it will be appropriate to adjust the stance of policy .  \nThe outlook only gets more uncertain from there . My view, as outlined earlier this year  in \nremarks at the Kansas City Fed’s Agricultural Symposium in Omaha ,1 is that while the current \nstance of policy is restrictive, it is not that restrictive.  \nThis view is based in part on the resilience of the economy and growth over the past two \nyears  even as interest rates climbed sharply higher.  Of course, last week’s employment report for \nJuly led many to question this resilience.  But it is important to note that many other indicators \npoint to continued strength.  Real GDP increased over 3 percent last year, faster than any year but \none in the decade prior to the pandemic, notwithstanding the low interest rates of that era.  More \nrecently, real GDP increased a  further 2¾ percent in the second quarter , supported by the \ncontinued strength of consumer demand and solid investment spending , and while it is \nadmittedly early , indicators for the third quarter show these trends continuing . Even more \nimportant, as I t alk to contacts in the region, I continue to hear a general tone of optimism and \nresilience . \nReturning to last week’s labor market data  for July . The rise in the unemployment rate to \n4.3 percent has certainly refocused attention on the employment side of the Fed’s mandate.  \nAcross many indicators, there has been a  noticeable cooling of the labor market from the \nhistorically tight  conditions  of 2023 and 2022 . But overall , the labor market still appears healthy .  \nAt the Kansas City Fed , we combine information from 26 labor market indicators into \nwhat we call the KC Labor Market Conditions Indicator (or LMCI) .2 Looking much broader than \nthe unemployment rate alone, the labor market still appears to be quite strong by this measure.  \nThis aligns with my discussions with district contacts, which generally acknowledge a cooling of \nthe market but not a sense of widespread disruptions or declines.  At this point, the cooling of the \nlabor market can be viewed as  a necessary condition for the easing of inflation that we have \nexperienced.  Imbalances in the labor market were a key factor keeping inflation high , and a \nlooser market was needed to bring inflation down . However, this story could change if \nconditions were to weaken considerably more . \n \n1 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/Speeches/documents/10168/2024 -Schmid-Omaha-05-14.pdf.  \n2 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-trends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ .  \n\n5 \n The path of policy will be determined by the data and the strength of the economy.  With \nthe tremendous shocks that the economy has endured so far this decade, I would not want to \nassume any particular path or endpoint for the policy rate.  This is to say the data and the \nperformance of the  economy should guide  policy rather than a presumption that we must return \nto some pre -pandemic perception of normal.  I will be carefully watching the data and gathering \ninformation on growth, jobs, and inflation as I judge the appropriate path for policy . Thank you."

Omaha Branch \nExecutive and Senior Vice President Nate Kauffman has organized an impressive gathering , and \nI thank each of you for being here . As leaders in your field, I recognize  the value of your time , \nand I appreciate your commitment in attending this event.  Likewise, my Fed colleagues and I are \ncommitted  to listening and learning  from the discussion today and tomorrow . Events like these \nplay a critical role in the Fed’s mission.  By engaging with a wide cross section  of industry and \nsociety , the Fed receives necessary information and input to guide the nation’s monetary policy.  \nThe strength of this network has helped make the  Federal Reserve one of the most successful \ncentral bank s in the world.   \nThe Federal Reserve’s effectiven ess is rooted in its 12-district  regional structure.  Having \n12 geographically defined Federal Reserve regions, each represented by a different Bank, allows \nfor the efficient and effective collection of diver se views on the economy  while also \nstrengthening  relationships with the communities we serve  and ensur ing that all segments of the \neconomy have a voice in monetary policy.  The system  continues to work very well and is a credit \nto the vision of  its creators.    \nFor the Kansas City Fed , agriculture is an important element  of our distinct voice , as is \nenergy, the theme of this year’s summit . Agriculture touches all 12 Fed eral Reserve  districts, but \nits imprint is particularly large in  the seven -state region covered by  the Kansas City Fed . We \ndevote  a fair amount of time, led by Nate Kauf fman, to analyzing and reporting on the sector  and \nevents like this further strengthen our bond.   \nThe agricultural economy in our region, and nationally, has gone through significant \nchanges over the past 10 to 15 years, with many of those changes tied to evolving global demand \nfor agricultural products. Growth in emerging economies, such as China, and  the rise of biofuels \nare two examples of factors that have shaped long -term demand for key agricultural commodities \nin the U.S. and globally. As we look ahead to factors that may further shape agriculture over the \nnext decade, we recognize that demand for  energy, and renewables in particular, will continue to \nplay a significant role.  \nAs we look to understand how the structure of agriculture might evolve in the years \nahead , I am here as an information  consumer, to listen  and learn from the experts in the room.  \nHowever, since now is my time on the agenda to be a produce r, I will turn to my views on the \noverall economy and the outlook for monetary policy.   \n\n2 \n  \nSubstantial Progress but Challenges Remain  \nAt the end of 2022, with inflation running near a 40-year hig h and the Fed in the middle \nof a historic tightening cycle, almost everyone was asking how much of a  slowdown  was it going \nto take to bring inflation back down towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective.  The consensus answer  \nat the time  was quite a bit . The majority of professional forecasters predicted  a recession in 2023.  \nBut we didn’t have a recession.  Instead , the pace of economic growth more than doubled even as \ninflation halved, all while the unemployment rate remained near all -time lows.      \nDespite this relative  success,  challenges remain.  Primarily, inflation is still  too high.  The \nFed is committed to bringing inflation back to its 2 percent objective.  So far this year, prices \nhave been increasing at about twice that pace, suggesting that the Fed has more work to do.   \nWe have seen a substantial shift in the underlying drivers of inflation over the past two \nyears.  Goods price inflation has eased considerably , as pandemic -related production disruptions \nfaded  and supply chains healed.  In contrast, services price inflation has remained firm , supported \nby a tight labor market .  \nPart of the strength of services inflation has been rents and the cost of housing . Rents \nhave been supported by strong income growth and the healthy labor market.  When a worker  gets \na job, they often want to upgrade their living space , and a tight labor market has historically \ndriven higher rents and housing costs.1 \nHowever, the strength of services price inflation has been broader than rents alone.  \nServices tend to be very labor intensive, so a tight labor market can be an important driver of \ninflation in this area.  And it is not just that the cost of labor tends to increase with labor market \ntightness.  If businesses are not able to hire sufficient labor, increas ing prices is one way to \nbalance supply and demand for their products and services independent of what they are doing \nwith wages.    \nTo recap, inflation is too high on account of a continued imbalance between the strength \nof demand and the economy ’s ability  to produce enough  supply to meet that demand.  Whereas \nwith the start  of the recent inflation , this imbalance was most apparent for goods . Now the \nimbalance has moved to  services and housing.   \n \n1 “A Tight Labor Market Could Keep Rent Inflation Elevated .” Lee Smith, Brent Bundick, and Luca Van Der Meer. \nEconomic Bulletin . Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. March 1, 2023.  \n\n3 \n Though elevated inflation is always painful, it is important to note that inflation ary \nperiods  are not the same.  The high inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s was rooted less in a \nstrong economy  than in the  psychology of price setting.  During that period, prices increased \nbecause firms and workers expected prices to go up, even though the economy was not \nparticularly strong .  \nToday , inflation expectations remain relatively low and anchored . The inflation we are \nseeing is coming from strong demand and an imbalance in the economy.  It is important that the \nFed act to preempt  inflation from becoming ingrained into the price -setting process, a \ndevelopment that would make lowering inflation all the more difficult.   \n \nThe Path Forward  \nWith the current imbalance -driven inflation, the Fed’s approach is relatively \nstraightforward.  The Fed must hold back  demand growth until supply can catch up and the \nimbalance that is driving inflation closes.  This is what the Fed is doing . By increasing the policy \nrate by 5¼ percentage points over the past two years , the Fed has tightened financial conditions \nand slowed demand growth.   \nWhile the overall economy remains strong, there are signs that  the imbalances driving \ninflation are easing.  The labor market has come off a historic boil by many measures.  At the \npeak, there were over two available job postings for every person reporting themselves as \nunemployed.  More recently, this number has fallen below 1½  postings for every unemployed \nperson , which is still high but is easing back.  We have also seen a decline in the  rate at which \nworkers are quitting their jobs.  When the labor market was very tight, workers were quitting at a \nhistoric rate , either as they found new jobs or expected to find them quickly . \nThe Fed works on inflation by easing demand, but our job is made easier by increases in \nsupply . An increased  supply of goods and services can also close imbalances and lower price \npressure.  Recently the supply outlook has improved, with solid growth and increased \nproductivity. The decline in the quits rate has been one factor  boosting  labor productivity and the \nsupply side of the economy.  Worker churn during the peak of labor market tightness and the \nassociated high  hiring and training costs were a drag on the productive capacity of the economy.  \nAs the labor market cools, this drag on productivity has dissipate d, boosting supply and easing \ninflation .  \n\n4 \n Over time , I expect inflation to ease back towards the Fed’s 2 percent objective.  I am \nprepared to be patient as this process plays out.  This will require a data -dependent approach that \nlooks at the data over time rather than loading too much weight on any one release . Although \nthere is an eagerness to spot turning points, I prefer a steady approach to policy, and one that \ndampens the volatility in financial markets rather than contributes to it.  \n \nInterest Rates Could Stay Higher for Longer  \nThat said, my own view is that interest rates could remain high for some time.  The \neconomy has undergone seismic shifts so far this decade . I have no certainty that we  are headed \nback to the low interest rate environment  that prevailed in the decade prior to the pandemic.   \nOne factor that I view as  particularly important here is the prospect of continued large \nfiscal deficits and the tremendous expansion of government debt, both in the United States and \nthroughout the world.  Prior to the pandemic, one often -cited explanation for the relatively low \ninterest rates of the period was high demand for  safe assets, including government  debt, relative \nto the supply of those assets.  Increased demand from financial institutions  as well as strong \ngrowth in China and emerging markets had boosted demand for such assets , bidding up their \nprice and holding down interest rates across the yield curve .  \nHowever, now this demand has cooled even as the supply of government debt has jumped \nand is expected to continue growing at a very rapid rate.  As such, it is possible that the balance of \ndemand and supply for government debt will shift from a factor holding down interest rates to a \nfactor boosting interest rates.  \nImportantly, shifts in supply and demand for safe assets influence interest rates \nindependent of the Fed’s actions. Though the Fed is not a passive bystander and plays a role in \nsetting short -term interest rates, it can’t perpetually deviate rates from mar ket forces without \nrisking its mandates for maximum employment and price stability. In this way, the Fed takes \nfiscal decisions as given and steers monetary policy in the appropriate direction to achieve its \ndual mandate.  \nIn the end, large fiscal deficits will not be inflationary because the Fed will do its job  and \nachieve its inflation objective , through  in doing so the outcome  could be persistently higher  \ninterest rates.  This relationship is also at the crux of the rationale for the political independence \nof the central bank.  Political authorities could very well  prefer that deficits not lead to higher  \n\n5 \n interest rates, but history has shown that  following through on  this impulse has often resulted in \nhigher inflation.  An independent central bank insulated from immediate political pressure and \nguided by a clear inflation objective has historically been an effective means for achieving and \nmaintaining low and stable inflation.   \n \nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet  \nIn part, c entral bank independence also motivates my position on another aspect of Fed \npolicy, the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet.  As part of the policy response to the \npandemic , the Fed embarked on a historic expansion of its balance sheet, purchasing trillions of \ndollars of Treasurys and mortgage -backed securities.  With the short -term policy interest rate \nstuck at zero, the purpose of these purchases w as to depress longer term interest rates  and \nstimulate economic activity . With the econo my recovering and price pressure s growing , the Fed \nappropriately started to reverse  these purchases in the middle of 2022, allowing maturing \nsecurities to roll off  and shrinking its balance sheet by $1.5 trillion relative to its peak.   \nAt the FOMC meeting two weeks ago, the committee announced that it would slow the \npace of this run off starting in June . The idea is that a slower pace will allow for a safer and less \ndisruptive approach to the balance sheet’s ultimate size  as determined by bank demand for \nreserves, the Fed’s primary liability.   \nWhile I understand this rationale  does not imply that the balance sheet will end up being \nany larger in the end , I would still reconfirm my preference to shrink the balance sheet as much \nas possible consistent with the Fed’s current operating framework . While a larger balance sheet \nlowers the risk of sharp movements in money market interest rates, maintaining a large balance \nsheet is not without cost . I am focused on three costs in my preference for a  relatively aggressive \napproach to balance sheet reduction:  \n \n1. First, a large balance sheet weighs on longer -term yields, distorting the price of duration  \nin financial markets  and potentially leading to distortions in the allocation of credit.  A \nsmaller balance sheet concentrated in shorter duration securities would lessen this \ndistortion.   \n\n6 \n 2. Second, a large balance sheet increases the Fed’s footprint in financial markets, \npotentially diminishing and weakening other mechanisms and markets for distributing \nliquidity across financial institutions and leading to a more brittle  financial  syste m.   \n3. And t hird, as I alluded to earlier, maintaining a large balance sheet can give the \nuncomfortable impression that monetary and fiscal policy are intertwined. Maintaining an \nexcessively large Treasury portfolio can give  the impression that the Fed’s balance sheet \nis supporting government debt markets.  \n \n In conclusion , I believe policy is in the correct place , and with patience we are on a path \nto achieve our policy objectives.  However, nothing is certain and continued vigilance and \nflexibility are necessary.   \nThank you again for joining us in Omaha , and I look forward to our discussion."

A special thank you to our \nhosts, Joe Parcell and Emily Garwood from Kansas State , and Chuck Marv ine and Russ Behnam \nfrom the CFTC. Russ was kind enough to provide the keynote for the Kansas City Fed’s National \nAg Credit Conference last month . These types of cross -institution events are crucial for helping \nus understand key economic issues in the agricultural sector.   \nAgriculture plays an important role  in the economy, especially  in this part of the country . \nWhile locally important , the factors that influence  the ag economy  are often  global . Commodity \nmarkets  are subject to  shifting weather  patterns , swings in global growth , and geopolitical \ndevelopments . Commodity prices adjust quickly to these influences and  provide a real -time \nsignal  on the balance between  supply and demand . Commodity futures markets help \ncommunicate supply and demand conditions to a wider audience  and allow users and producers \nto hedge price risk . The CFTC plays an important role in promoting the integrity and resilience \nof these markets through effective regulation.   \nJust as  in commodity markets, price s and inflation  in the broader economy  also reflect  the \nbalance between  supply and demand . And, as we  have  witnessed in recent years,  a persistent \nimbalance  between the two  can lead to prolonged episodes  of elevated price inflation.   \nIn my remarks this afternoon, I  will offer my thoughts on the evolution of  imbalances in \nour economy and the ir implications for our progress towards low and stable inflation  as well as \nfor the appropriate path of monetary policy .  \n \nInflation and Wages  \nCongress  has provided the Federal Reserve with two monetary policy mandates : price \nstability  and maximum employment . The Fed interprets price stability to be consistent with a 2 \npercent inflation objective as measured by the annual change in the  personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE) price index . This measure  aims to capture price movements  across the vast \narray of  goods and services purchased by consumers.  \nDuring the post -pandemic economic recovery, inflation surged  above 7 percent,  a 40-year \nhigh, as robust demand ran up against supply bottlenecks and constraints on production . \nAlthough inflation has stepped down significantly  since the F ed began raising interest rates in \n\n2 \n 2022, it remains above the 2 percent  definition of price stability . Inflation has surprised to the \nupside since the beginning of the year  and has run  at roughly a 4 percent annual rate  during the \nfirst quarter . This recent data underscores what I believe is the need for the Federal Reserve to be \npatient as we wait  for clear and convincing evidence that inflation is on track to sustainably \nreturn to 2 percent .  \nLooking ahead , I will be watching three factors to monitor progress towards our inflation \ngoal:  \n• First, the tightness of the labor market and consequent upward pressure on labor -\nintensive service prices . \n• Second,  the potential for an increased supply of labor to relieve labor market \ntightness .  \n• And t hird, the risk that renewed supply chain challenges could provide an unwelcome \nboost to inflation .       \n \nElaborating further  on the first factor : Elevated services price inflation is now the primary \ndriver of  overall  inflation in the economy.1  For example, higher prices for healthcare services \ncontributed significantly to the rebound in inflation  since the beginning of the year . The \nproduction of many services tends to be labor intensive . As a result , strong services prices are \nbeing supported by the tightness of the  labor market and the ongoing imbalance between the  \neconomy’s  demand for workers and the available  supply of labor .    \nAnd t he demand for labor continues to be strong . This is  evidenced by robust hiring and \nelevated wage growth . So far this year , firms added an average of 2 70,000 jobs per month to \ntheir payrolls , far above the historical norm . Postings for new positions  also remain elevated, \nwhile initial claims for unemployment insurance have remain ed low for some time now .  \nIndirectly, the ongoing tightness in the labor market has also pushed up the cost of \nhousing , an important contributor to the current strength of overall inflation . New work \narrangements and changing preferences increased the demand for living space during and after \nthe pandemic, leading to  a rapid increase in house prices and rents . After peaking near 9 percent  \nin 2022, rent inflation moderated significantly last year . However, the contribution of rents to \n \n1 See Supercore PCE Inflation Surged in January to Its Highest Monthly Level in More than Two Years , by  \nJordan Rappaport, A. Lee Smith, and Shu -Kuei X. Yang .  \n\n3 \n overall inflation remains well above its the pre-pandemic rate . Research by staff at the Kansas \nCity Fed suggests that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could keep rent inflation \nelevated for some time.2 Job gains and wage increases put upward pressure on rents and housing \nprices as income growth increases household demand for additional and higher -quality living \nspaces . \nA second factor I will be watching  is the outlook for the supply of labor . Last year, the \neconomy experienced  a large increase in the workforce , especially among women  aged 25 -55. In \naddition, the economy experienced a post -pandemic rebound in immigration  over the  last year. \nThis improvement in the economy’s ability to supply labor helped to ease tightness in the labor \nmarket .  \nDespite  these improvements in the supply of labor, wage growth  continues to signal an \nimbalance between  labor  demand and the number of available workers to meet that demand . \nWhile wage growth has moderated from its recent peak, it remains elevated compared to early \nperiods and likely is continuing to put upward pressure on services prices .  \nLooking beyond wages, t he Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators \n(LMCI) provide another  way to measure th e ongoing tightness in the labor market . These \nindicators, which are published monthly  on the Kansas City Fed’s website, summarize  many  \ndifferent labor market variables into measures of activity and momentum .3 According to the  most \nrecent  LMCI,  activity in the labor market remains well above its longer -run average level , \nsuggesting that the labor market remains tight  relative to its historical norm . \nA third thing I will be keeping an eye on is a  potential reacceleration in goods inflation . \nAs robust demand for goods ran up against supply bottlenecks during the post -pandemic  \nrecovery, prices for many goods rose rapidly and contributed significantly to the overall increase \nin inflation . While prices for goods have been roughly flat over the past year, recent disruptions \nto global shipping  imply some upside risk to goods prices going forward . Relatedly,  energy \nprices are also up significantly since the beginning of the year , which pose s an additional \nheadwind to sustainably low and stable inflation .             \n \n \n2 See A Tight Labor Market Could Keep Rent Inflation Elevated , by Brent Bundick, A. Lee Smith, and Luca Van der \nMeer .  \n3 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/data -and-trends/labor -market-conditions -indicators/ . \n\n4 \n Ultimately, achieving better balance in the labor market will likely be necessary for \nFederal Reserve policymakers to deliver on our price stability mandate and achieve 2 percent \ninflation . However, uncertainty  remains as to the role that improvements in  labor supply will \nplay versus slower labor demand in rebalanc ing labor markets . While I welcome the  significant \ngrowth  witnessed  in the economy’s  workforce last year , it remains unclear  whether this rapid \npace of supply improvement will continue going forward .  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy  \nWith inflation  still running above 2 percent and labor markets still tight, it is appropriate \nthat monetary policy remain restrictive . Over the past two years , the FOMC has raised  the \nfederal funds rate by over 500 basis points and has started to unwind the  large portfolio of  \nsecurity holdings it amassed on its  balance sheet . All of this is  an effort to help rebalance demand \nand supply in the economy and restore price stability .  \nEven with these actions , the demand for goods and services has displayed remarkable \nresilience to higher interest rates . The economy continues to grow  at a pace well above its \nlonger -run trend . Much of this  increase in overall growth has been driven by strong consumer \nspending . With increasing house prices and equity market s near all -time highs , the strength of \nhousehold balance sheets appears to be  encouraging households to spend rather than save despite \nthe high interest rates . Accordingly, the household savings rate remains near historic lows .  \nSimilarly, in the agricultural sector, although farm incomes are expected to be down this \nyear, they remain above their pre -pandemic levels . While higher interest expenses and reduced \nincomes may be weighing on some highly leveraged producers, the overall financial picture in \nagriculture remain s strong. Most lenders report that the credit qual ity of their farm portfolio has \nbeen strong, loan delinquencies are still historically low, and profits of recent years continue to \nsupport strong balance sheets. In addition, despite the increase in interest rates over the past  two \nyears, farmland value s remain  firm alongside relatively strong global demand for agricultural \nproducts. The strength of global demand for agricultural products is a topic we will explore \nfurther in a n event next month in Omaha , where we will look forward to connecting with a \nvariety of businesses tied to agriculture to hear their thoughts on longer -term factors shaping \ncommodity markets.  \n \n\n5 \n This ongoing resilience in the economy c reates  some uncertainty about the path of  the \nfederal  funds rate that will be needed to restore price stability . With inflation running above \ntarget, economic growth continuing to show momentum , and elevated prices across a range of  \nasset markets , the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate . Therefore, r ather than \npreemptively adjust the policy rate , I would prefer  to be patient and wait for  clear and  convincing \nevidence that  inflation is on track  to hit our 2 percent  target before adjusting the stance of policy .  \n \nThe Outlook for the Fed eral Reserve’s  Balance Sheet  \nNow, I’d like to turn to another one of the Fed’s policy tools: its balance sheet. While  the \nlevel of the federal funds rate  has held  steady  since  July of last year, the Fed has continued to \nshrink the size of its balance sheet . As I see it, reducing  the Fed’s  balance sheet is important for \ntwo reasons. First, balance sheet reduction  helps reduce  the overall degree of policy \naccommodation  at time  when policy should remain restrictive . And second, moving towards a \nsmaller balance sheet is important to lessen the Fed’s footprint in financial markets.  \nFor some context, the balance sheet grew significantly as the Fed responded forcefully to \nthe COVID -19 pandemic. To help stabilize the economy , the Federal Reserve purchased large \nquantities of Treasuries and agency mortgage -backed securities . These purchases were carried \nout to reduce long -term interest rates  and ensure financial markets continue d to function  amid \nlockdowns and historic uncertainty . Consequently , the Fed’s balance sheet more than doubled  \nfrom just under $ 4.5 trillion in 20 19 to nearly $9 t rillion in 2022 . To fund these purchases, the \nFederal Reserve  expanded the quantity of reserves in the banking system .      \nSince June of 2022, the FOMC has reduced its holdings  by more  than $1.5 trillion . \nHowever,  the balance sheet remains large and continues to put downward pressure on long -term \ninterest rates . With inflation running above target, a tight labor market, and historically high \nequity valuations, the economy and financial markets no longer require support from a  large \ncentral bank balance sheet . Rather, given the state of the economy, m y preference is for a much \nsmaller balance sheet with a shorter average maturity .  \nThe Fed’s large  balance sheet and footprint can also obscure price signals  and distort \nfinancial markets . Our holdings put downward pressure on longer -term rates and flatten the yield \ncurve . This stresses  the traditional model of borrowing and lending  central to the health of  many \ncommunity banks . In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to hold a large fraction of the total \n\n6 \n outstanding stock of agency mortgage -backed securities . These significant holdings could distort \nthe allocation of credit  and lead to future imbalances . As the Committee discussed in its \nPrinciples for Reducing the Size of the Balance sheet ,4 I believe our balance sheet should \nprimarily be composed of Treasury securities to minimize the effect of the Fed’s holdings on the \nprice and allocation of credit in the economy.  \nThe Fed’s large balance sheet is also suppressing  price signals  in funding markets.  \nFluctuations in interbank lending rates  provide timely signals to market participants about \nliquidity conditions in funding markets . For some time  now, the federal funds rate has traded \nconsistently 7 basis points below the interest rate on reserve balances and shown no sensitivity to \nfluctuations in reserves . This suggests  that liquidity remains abundant . These price signals imply \nthat our current pace of balance sheet reduction is not creating strains in funding markets .  \nHowever, unlike our previous balance sheet normalization in  2019, the Federal Reserve \nhas established the Standing Repo Facility , and banks have shown a greater willingness to use \nthe discount window . If runoff began to unexpectedly stress funding markets and the spreads in \nthe interbank market rose significantly, these liquidity tools would be available to prevent a \nsignificant  increase in short -term market interest rates . As we learn about broader liquidity \ndemand in the system through these price signals, I believe it will be important to tolerate some \nmore normal volatility in interest rates .  \nTolerating some interest rate volatility during runoff could improve the longer -term \nhealth of funding markets , which may all ow the financial system to operate with fewer reserves . \nWith a constantly evolving financial system, the appropriate amount of reserves needed to \nefficiently conduct monetary policy will not be defined by a fixed quantity but rather the ability \nof the financial system to redistribute that liquidity as needed .  \nConsistent with the theme of my remarks today , price signals from markets will be \nnecessary to help properly allocate this liquidity . Stopping balance sheet runoff too early poses  a \nrisk of further weakening the channels of liquidity redistribution . Along these lines, completely \nsmothering  rate volatility could make the interbank market less resilient and sow the seeds of \nfuture financial market instability.      \n \n \n \n4 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm  \n\n7 \n Conducting Policy Under Uncertainty  \nWith various unknowns surrounding the macroeconomic outlook, knowing the exact \nfuture course of monetary policy is always difficult . Jim Collins , the author , has been influential \nin my thinking as a leader  throughout my career . In his book, Great By Choice , he says that, \n“None of us can predict with certainty the twists and turns our lives will take.” In a rapidly \nevolving economic and financial landscape  only four years after the outbreak  of a global \npandemic , this statement resonates with me .  \nAs a policymaker though, I am certain that my colleagues and I on the FOMC will take \nnecessary actions to restore price stability and achieve maximum employment . For now, I view \nthe current stance of monetary policy as appropriate to achieve those objectives . Going forward, \nI’ll be watching for further  signs of progress in returning inflation sustainably back to our 2 \npercent target ."

It is my pleasure  to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity and our first ever “ Workshop on the Future of Banking.”  I am  pleased to be joined today by \nbank executives from the Tenth D istrict and across the nation as well as a number of  esteemed \nacademics and industry representatives. It is my  hope that together we will have a productive \nconversation about  the key issues affecting the banking industry , whose success is vital to our \neconomy . I would also like to recognize that m any of you here today represent community \nbanks . Your  local ly focused  banks  are integral to our financial system  as service providers and  \nour society  more broadly because of  your  enduring commitment to civic engagement.  I hope to \nhear more  in our conversations today about how your  banks  strengthen local communities a s \nwell as the challenges and opportunities  you fac e.  \nOur discussion this morning will take an in- depth look at how banks are positioning \nthems elves for the future . In particular,  I am  interested in learning more about how banks will \nharness emerging  technologies to increase efficiencies and develop new product s to serve thei r \ncustomers. However, our conversation will also focus on the challenges banks  face  and the tools \nthey will require to persevere  and thrive in today’s dynamic economy . Overall, I  hope to get a \nkeen sense of the role that policymaking can play  in helping banks navigate an evolving financial \nlandscape while always ensuring a safe and sound U .S. financial system .  \nThrough today’s panel discussions, I also hope to better understand the barriers \nconfronting prospective entrants to the banking industry . New bank owners and managers can \nbring innovative ideas and promote changes that improve efficiency and  access to financial \nservices for  businesses and consumers . Such changes may be particularly impactful to banking \ncustomers in rural or otherwise underserved areas that have historically had  relatively  limited \n\n2 \n financial services  offerings . Indeed, financial services access is a particularly important topic to \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  because our district contains many rural and low -to-\nmoderate -income communities. Innovati on can also create a more efficient financial system  that \nbenefits service providers by lowering costs and increasing profitability . Despite the potential \nbenefits,  however, new charter issuance has declined substantially since the Global Financial \nCrisis.  Today’s discussion will illuminate the reasons why this decline has occur red and the \npolicy changes  that might be necessary to  enable new charter ing activity . \nOutside of new charters, entry into the banking industry can occur through the acquisition \nof existing bank charters  as well . Allowing fresh , innovative owners  to acquire existing banks  \ncan enhanc e system resiliency and increase new product offerings  in much the  same way that de \nnovo chart ering can . In fact, under certain circumstances, investors might be indifferent between \nacquiring an existing bank and setting up a new bank, as my colleague Governor Bowman has \npointed out in the past . However, in practice, there has been a clear  preference  for charter \nacquisition over de novo formation  among recent market participants . Therefore, I think it is \nreasonable for policymakers to ask , what  tradeoffs are involved when entry occurs via  \nacquisition rather than  de novo chartering ?  \nRelatedly, I am  interested in how consolidation across banks can affect  the future \nstructure of our community banking network. For the past 40 years, banks have steadily consolidated , resulting in fewer bank charters and increased institutional size and complexity.  \nWhile increased size and complexity has brought substantial challenges for both bank managers and supervisors, many argue th at the prolonged period of consolidation has resulted in a more \nefficient system that better meets  the needs of borrowers. At the same time, having fewer banks  \nmay decrease competition and  reduce access to financial services for some communities. I \n\n3 \n believe policymakers  have a n obligation to ensure financial services remain  reasonably \naccessible across a diverse range of localities  and communities . In turn, it makes sense to ask  if a \ncontinuation of the current consolidation trends will help or hinder this goal.  \nWe will also explor e questions surrounding bank competit ion today . Financial market \ncompetition has been fierce in recent years both  among traditional banks and  between  banks and \nnon-banks . In particular, nonbank competition has  increased substantially due to both greater  \ncompetition from traditional finance , such as credit unions  and the farm credit system , as well as \na rise in innovative financial startups such as fintechs. Policymakers should continually \nreevaluate whether the lens through which they view competition accurately  reflects the world in \nwhich modern banks operate .   \nOverall, the main objective of today’s workshop is to have  a conversation with an \nimportant set of stakeholders that will be  directly affected by ongoing market changes . However, \nI also understand there  are other  groups  who  have a vested interest in  the matters we will discuss . \nTo that end, I am hopeful that today’s event will be the starting  point for a larger conversation \namong all stakeholders . Ultimately, my goal  is to encourage  inform ed policy choices that lead to \na better financial system for the country  — one  that meets the needs of both modern financial \nservices  providers and the American people.  \nPersonally, I am very excited to host this event because these are issues that are near and \ndear to me. As a former community  banker myself , I ha ve ha d the opportunity to both operate \nestablished  banks  and to engage in mergers and acquisition s. So needless to say, I have sat where \nyou sit , and I have experienced  many of the challenges you face. I also have a deep passion for \nthe benefits that  community banks bring to our nation as both financial service s providers and as \npillars of our  local communities. As the lender of choice for many small businesses, community \n\n4 \n banks ensure  our local economies continue to thrive by meet ing businesses’  essential  financi al \nneeds . Community banks  have also continually demonstrated  an ability to understand the unique \nchallenges households and businesses face in their communities . It is my hope  that policymakers \ncan maximize the  benefits th at community bank s provide to our local communities while \nenhancing the ir health and resiliency.  For this reason, I look forward to hearing your views and \ndiscussing the many issues on the table today.   \nI would now like to introduce my Federal Reserve colleague, Governor Michelle \nBowman. Governor Bowman has been a member of the Federal Reserve Board since 2018. Prior \nto her Federal Reserve appointment, she served as Kansas state banking commissioner for t wo \nyears and as an executive of Farmers & Drovers Bank in Kansas. She also held staff positions in \nthe U.S. House and Senate as well as FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security. It is with great pleasure that I welcome Governor Bowman."

As a former \nbank CEO, I came to appreciate the importance of the Fed’s  payment services for our nation’s  \neconomy . And m ore generally, as a resident of the region, I’ve always  found the Kansas City Fed \nto be a trusted  resource on regional and national economic issues.  \nThese interactions with the K ansas City  Fed built my trust in  the institution . And now, as \nBank president, I am responsible  for maintaining your trust , both in  the Kansas City Fed and the \nFederal Reserve System as a whole.  \nMy goal today is to start that process by sharing the three core principles I will bring to \nthe policy table  as our District’s representative on the Federal Open Market Committee.  \n \n• First, and perhaps foremost , I believe that the authority and effectiveness of a \nFederal Reserve B ank is rooted in its connections  to the  region it serves . And I see \nthe strength of those ties , not just in Kansas City but  for all 12 District banks,  as \ninstrumental to the success of the Federal Reserve System.   \n• Second, I believe in central banking that is  accountable and transparent but  \nindependent of political influence. The independence of the Fed, and the ability to \nset monetary policy without political consideration, best serves  our economy and \nnation.   \n• Third, and relatedly , I believe that an independent Fed is best served  by a cautious \napproach to the  Fed’s role  in the financial system. We must carefully consider \nhow our actions can affect  the long- term structure of financial markets. I will \nbring a preference for minimizing the  Fed’s  footprint , particularly  as it relates to  \nthe Fed’s balance sheet.   \n  \n\n2 \n The Importance of a Regional  System  \nOne of the most important parts of the job for a Fed president is building relationships in \nthe communities we serve. Events like this, carried out regularly across the Tenth District,  give \nme an opportunity to establish a dialogue between the Federal Reserve and our stakeholders. \nThrough these conversations, I can share  with you  my thinking on monetary  policy . But more \nimportantly, I can  gather information, insight , and perspective  from you that  I can  take back to \nWashington, D.C. , and  share with my colleagues  on the Federal Open Market Committee \n(FOMC). \nOver 100 years  ago the Federal Reserve System was designed t o build public trust  by \ndispers ing power and decision- making across the country. It was for this reason that the Fed \nSystem was established with governors in Washington, D.C. , and 12 regional R eserve B anks \nlocated across  the country . This decentralized system invites  diverse views , an important \ningredient in setting monetary policy by committee .1  \nThe regional R eserve B anks and B ranch offices allow the public to engage directly with \nthe central bank . This happens at all four of our District offices , including the one here in \nOklahoma City as well as those in Kansas City, Denver and Omaha.  \nLocal bankers, labor leaders, community develop ment officials , non- profit directors and \nbusiness executives serve on our boards  and advisory groups . They provide  an on- the-ground \nview of  the economy that can’t be found in aggregate economic data.   \nFor example, i n the Tenth District economy, agriculture and energy play an outsized role  \ncompared to rest of the nation , and therefore  national economic statistics  don’t always align  with \nthe economic experiences of district contacts . Unique economic features like these from each of \nthe 12 Federal R eserve districts  feed into regional survey results and B eige Book report s that are \nshared ahead of  each FOMC meeting . \nIn my brief stint on the job, I’ve quickly come to realize the value of these  regional \nreports as a compliment to  the national economic indicators that  also inform FOMC \ndeliberations.  \n \n1 Michael  D. Bordo and Edward S. Prescott (2023) argue that the Federal Reserve’s decentralized structure is also \nimportant for generating new ideas and reduc ing groupthink. These authors attribute  many important concepts  that \nhave shaped the intellectual framework for monetary policymaking to the  work done by research  departments at  \nregional Reserve Banks.  \n\n3 \n A regional perspective  is also important for  regulating and supervising financial \ninstitutions . Simply put, the business model of a community bank in  rural  Nebraska, like the one \nI led early in my career , is fundamentally different than a global financial institution in New \nYork.  \nFor this reason, it is important that bank regulators take a tailored approach to manage the \nunique risks  posed by different institutions. Effective regulation should ensure that the hundreds \nof regional and community banks in the Tenth District are safe and sound. But regulatory \nframeworks should also acknowledge that a one -size- fits-all approach to  regulation can come \nwith significant  compliance costs and  threaten the ability of  community banks to supply credit \nand deposit services to rural  households , agricultural producers, and small businesses .   \nWhile I’ve emphasized the importance of a regional perspective,  it is also essential for \ncertain aspects of the U.S. financial system to be integrated across geographies, including the \nclearing of payments. For this reason, the Federal Reserve has taken a more centralized approach \nto providing financial services.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s new 24/7/365 payments system , FedNow , is a great example of \nhow the larger Federal Reserve System can be leveraged to deliver services that benefit our \ndistrict and the nation. FedNow is the Fed’s first major new payment rail in over 40 years and \naims to bring instant payments technology to all financial institutions, no matter their  size or \nlocation.  \n \nCentral Bank Independence  \nThe second principle that is core to my thinking as a new  member of the FOMC  is the  \nimportance of  the independence of the central bank.   \nThe polic y choices made by the Fed  impact the livelihoods and finances of everyone  in \nthe economy . Naturally, this invites scrutiny , especially in difficult economic times.  \nAnd historically it is not unusual to hear  disapproval of the Fed’s handling of the \neconomy. There are times that the c riticism is justified . Acknowledging mistakes and learning \nfrom them is important for maintaining our accountability. However, history has shown that a \n\n4 \n central bank that  acts without political interference deliver s better economic outcomes.2 \nTherefore, preserving the independence of the central bank is essential for securing long-run \neconomic prosperity. \nThe best way to maintain the Fed’s independence is by remaining narrowly focused on \nthe mandates  that Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve Act directs \nthe FOMC  to conduct monetary policy to promote the dual mandate of maximum employment \nand stable prices. By assigning the Fed these goals, but removing itself from the conduct of \nmonetary policy, C ongress created a system for the Fed to pursue policies that are in the \neconomy’s long-run interests without interference from  short- term political considerations.   \nNevertheless, history shows that the Federal Reserve Act does not prevent the Fed from \nbeing the subject of outside pressures. These pressures tend to intensify when the FOMC faces a \ntradeoff between promoting maximum employment and price stability . P a u l  Vo lcker, for \nexample, received substantial criticism for pursuing lower inflation at the cost of high \nunemployment.3  \nThis is an instance when the Fed’s two mandates were not complementary , which places  \nthe Fed in an especially difficult position because it can appear that the FOMC  is elevating one \nmandate above the other. But one lesson that can be learned from the economy’s historical performance is that price stability is a n important precondition for sustaining maximum \nemployment.  \nThe economy’s pre -pandemic performance is a great example of the benefits  that price \nstability can bring to the labor market . In 2019, the unemployment rate reached multi- decade \nlows without pushing up inflation. This was in large part because prior decades of experience \nhad established the confidence that the Fed would deliver price stability .\n4  \n \n2 Researcher s have  found that more independent central banks ( i.e., those that conduct policy without political \ninfluence) deliver lower and less variable rates of inflation over time  without any apparent sacrifice of higher \nunemployment . See : Cukierman , Alex,  Steven B. Webb , and Bilin Neyapti. 1992. “Measuring the Independence of \nCentral Banks and Its Effect on Policy Outcomes ”. T he World Bank Economic Review.  and Alesina , Alberto  and \nLawrence H. Summers . 1993. “Central Bank Independence and Macroeconomic Performance: Some Comparative \nEvidence” . J ournal of Money, Credit, and Banking. \n3 The pressures that Chairman Paul V olcker and the FOMC came under during this period are well documented in: \nTodd, Timothy. The Balance of Power: The Political Fight for an Independent Central Bank, 1790- Present  \n4 Kansas City  Fed staff research has found  that the FOMC’s efforts to anchor longer -run inflation expectations likely \nweakened the inflationary effects from low rates of unemployment during this period.  See Bundick, Brent and A. \nLee Smith. 2023. “Did the Federal Reserve Break the Phillips Curve? Theory and evidence of Anchoring Inflation \nExpectations” . F ederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Research Working Paper 20 -11. \n\n5 \n Of course, this favorable balance was upset by the aftermath  of the pandemic. Inflation \nspiked to 40- year highs , and the FOMC took decisive actions  to reduce inflation, reinforcing its \ncommitment  to restoring price stability. Returning to a low and stable inflation rate is important \nfor the economy’s long- run health and I believe will set the stage for sustainably achieving \nmaximum employment.  \n \nMinimizing the Federal Reserve’s Financial Footprint  \nThe severity of the past two  economic recessions  strained the ability of the Fed to pursue \nits dual mandate with the use of conventional monetary policy. Rather than rely solely on \nreductions in the federal funds rate, the FOMC  turned to unconventional form s of polic y easing , \nincluding large balance sheet expansions . This brings me to the  third principle that guides my \nthinking as a new  policymaker , which is to minimize the Fed’s footprint in the financial system , \nparticularly as it relates to the Fed’s balance sheet .  \nThe Fed’s actions during both the  2008 Global  Financial C risis and the  COVID -19 \npandemic  included purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage -backed  \nsecurities . These purchases increased the size and scope of the Fed’s balance sheet.  \nTo put some numbers on it, the Fed’s balance sheet increased from less than $1 trillion \ndollars in 2007 to nearly $9 trillion by 2022, making the Fed a dominant holder of Treasury and \ngovernment -backed mortgage  debt . To fund these purchases, the Fed pumped money—mostly in \nthe form of bank reserves —into the economy. Managing interest rates with so much liquidity has \nrequired  a larger role for the Fed in overnight debt markets . This includes a sizeable reverse \nrepurchase facility with many non- bank counterparties. All of the se developments have increased \nthe Fed’s footprint in financial markets in recent decades . \nDecisive actions are appropriate and necessary when stresses threaten the health of the \nfinancial system and the economy . In this regard, the Fed’s ability  to stabilize markets and the \neconomy with its balance sheet is an important policy tool. However, m aintaining a  persistently  \nlarge presence in markets  in normal times  comes with costs and  increases  the possibility of  \nunintended consequences . These concerns  have been  highlighted by the Kansas City Fed in the \npast and are concern s I also share. To be speci fic, I offer three examples :  \n \n\n6 \n 1. First, maintaining a  large  portfolio of long- term Treasury and mortgage debt can create \ndistortions in the price of assets and the allocat ion of  credit. These distortions risk \nmisallocations  that can ultimately sow the seeds of future imbalances  in the economy .  \n \n2. Second, a  persistently large balance sheet can have unintended consequences on the \nstructure of the financial system. In making asset purchases, the Fed is lower ing longer -\nterm interest rates and flatten ing the yield curve. Failure to unwind these purchases can  \nchallenge the ability of banks to borrow short and lend long. This is  the business model \nthat many community banks rely upon. And the Fed’s  sizeable overnight  reverse repo  \nfacility  may  have unintended consequences on the allocation of liquidity and the role of \ndepository institutions in the economy.  \n \n3. Third, m aintaining a  large balance sheet can  give the uncomfortable impression that \nmonetary and fiscal policy are inter twined . As we’ve seen of late, a large balance sheet  \nexpose s the Fed to operating losses. And m aintaining a n excessively large  Treasury  \nportfolio offers the impression that the Fed ’s balance sheet  is supporting government debt  \nmarkets . Over time, b oth have the potential to threaten the Fed’s independence.     \n \nTo be clear, my position is that the balance sheet is an important monetary policy tool , \nespecially in times of cris is. However, once a  crisis has passed, it should be  a priority for the Fed \nto reduce its balance sheet and to lessen its footprint in financial markets . \n \nOutlook for the Economy and Monetary Policy \nBefore concluding, I’d like to share some brief  thoughts on the outlook for the economy \nand monetary policy.   \nSince the start of monetary policy tightening in 2022, inflation has stepped down \nsignificantly.  While this progress has been encouraging, when it comes to too high inflation, I \nbelieve we are not out of the woods  yet. The drop in inflation has largely been driven by \nreductions in energy and goods price inflation as oil markets rebalanced  and supply chains \nhealed .  \n\n7 \n But, as you well know in Oklahoma, energy prices are anything but stable. And turmoil in \nshipping routes through the Red Sea and the Panama Canal raise the prospect that supply chain \nconditions could worsen and put renewed pressure on goods prices.  \nAbsent further help from goods and energy prices, further disinflation will need to come \nthrough services. The January CPI inflation data argues for  caution on this front. The price s of \nservices —which comprise two- thirds of consumer spending—continue to rise  briskly amid still \ntight labor markets and elevated wage growth.  \nGiven the importance of labor costs for many service providers, r estoring balance in labor \nmarkets and moderating wage growth will likely be needed to secure inflation’s return to the \nFOMC’s 2 percent target.  \nLabor market tightness has eased over the past year  but has yet to fully normalize by a \nvariety of measures, including the K ansas City  Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators. Much \nof the progress last year in rebalancing labor markets and tempering wage pressures appeared to \nbe driven by increases in labor  supply. More recently though, labor force participation has fallen \noff from its recent highs, suggesting that a further moderation in demand could be  needed to \ntame price and wage pressures.  \nBut demand has remained resilient  to date. GDP growth has come in well above trend in \nrecent quarters, supported by strong consumer spending. And after adding more than 3 million \njobs in 2023, hiring in January remained robust with net job gains of more than 350,000. Looking ahead, many District contacts are upbeat about demand conditions in 2024, and I’m \nhearing few instances of layoffs . These reports are  consistent with the low levels of initial jobless \nclaims  and other indicators that generally point to still strong labor demand.  \nWith inflation running above target , labor markets tight,  and demand showing \nconsiderable momentum, my own view is that there is no need to preemptively adjust the stance of policy. Instead, I believe that the best course of action is to be patient , continue to watch how \nthe economy responds to the policy tightening that has occurred, and wait for convincing evidence that the inflation  fight has been won.  \nTying back to my earlier comments, I’m also in no hurry to halt the ongoing reduction in \nthe size of the Fed’s balance sheet. How much further the Fed can shrink its balance sheet is an \nopen question. I would note that a return to any pre -crisis norm is not realistic. Some balance \nsheet growth was inevitable ; as the economy grows, so too does demand for cash and bank \n\n8 \n reserves that the Fed must meet. However,  I don’t favor an overly cautious approach to balance \nsheet runoff for the sake of avoiding any volatility in interest rates. Instead , some interest -rate \nvolatility should be tolerated as we continue to shrink our balance sheet . \n \nConclusion  \nAs just the t enth president in the 109- year history of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, I am humbled by the responsibility I have been given to lead this trusted institution.  \nMy job is to be a steward of this B ank’s reputation for service and integrity in carrying \nout our public mission and to preserve that reputation for future presidents. In sharing these \nprinciples with you and my thoughts on the outlook, I hope that I have begun that process of \nbuilding your trust in how I will lead this Bank and represent the Tenth district at the FOMC ."

As the new president of the Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City, I am delighted to  be part of this event that started with the first Dallas and \nKansas City Fed energy conference in 2016. I want to thank Lorie Logan and the Dallas Fed for \ncontinuing this partnership and, on behalf of both Reserve Bank s, welcome everyone here and \nthose joining online. \nWe view this annual convening, rotating across several key energy cities in our Districts, \nas extremely important to helping us understand how the energy sector is evolving. Developments in the sector  have an important impact not only on the economy of both of our \nFed Districts, but also on the financial sector and national economy.   \n \nTHE 1970s AND ’80s EXPERIENCE  \nThis year, our focus is on improving supply chains and  the outlook for energy markets \nand capital allocation in the energy transition. As  I think about the topic of energy  transition , \nhowever, I may take a longer perspective than others.  \nI go back to when I was growing up in Nebraska in the 1970s and the oil crisis had a \nmajor negative economic impact. In a state so reliant on agriculture, dramatic moves in energy costs presented a significant challenge for producers. \nAs often occurs during a crisis, there was significant focus on innovation. While  there \nwas a lot of public discussion about the importance of energy conservation, you also had an \nincreasing interest in renewable energy resources , particularly solar power and ethanol. In \nNebraska during this time there was a lot of talk about gasohol. \nBut the transition that supporters of renewables said was underway didn’t unfold quite as \nexpected . When oil prices sank in the 1980s, some of the earlier  urgency was lost. Instead, a \ngeneral  collapse in  commodity prices that decade was the catalyst of a banking crisis that I was \nsoon in the midst of as a young bank examiner  with the FDIC in Kansas City . In the seven states \nof the Tenth Federal Reserve District, 350 banks either failed or received assistance in the 1980s, \nand I saw firsthand a lot of the difficulty and pain that the region experienced. \nIt was then when I first gained  an appreciation about how energy trends and markets can  \ndeeply affect overall regional and U.S. economic activity, financial stability, and inflation.  \n \n\n2 \n ENERGY AND THE TENTH DISTRICT ECONOMY  \nThis early lesson was reinforced  across my career . I can look back to various points as a \nbanker in Nebraska, and in areas of the western United States  where we had banks  and recall \nhow the movement of energy prices had a sometimes -significant  impact on consumers, \nbusinesses , and manufacturers  of all types.  \nAnd so, it is not only logical but essential that the Fed be aware of the current and \nemerging issues, challenges , and opportunities facing energy producers.  \nThe Tenth Federal Reserve District served by the Kansas City Fed , stretches from here in \nOklahoma all the way up to Wyoming and includes all or part of five  states in between . It ranks \nsecond among Fed Districts in total energy activity , after Dallas , with about 20 percent  of total \nU.S. energy production. The Tenth District accounts for more than 40 percent of U.S. coal \nproduction, about 25 percent of U.S. wind energy installation and more than 15 percent of U.S. \nnatural gas production.  \nA few of our states are among the nation’s leaders in both fossil fuels and renewables.  \nOf particular note  is Wyoming, which trails only Texas and Pennsylvania in total energy \nproduction. Wyoming is the nation’s top producer of coal and among the leaders in oil and natural gas. Oklahoma is also among our nation’s leaders in oil, natural gas , and wind energy. \nAnd while  New Mexico  is divided between the Kansas City and Dallas Fed Districts , it is also \none of the leading energy producers in oil, natural gas , and wind.  \nIn addition to energy production, several  of the Tenth  District’s largest companies  are \ndirectly engaged in the energy sector . Meanwhile , agriculture, transportation, and other \nindustries that are extremely important to our regional economy are major energy users . \nThus, as we think about it fr om an economic perspective, it is important that the Fed , \nparticularly those of us in regions such as mine , understand the full spectrum of energy  trends , \nfrom oil and gas to renewables , as well as the potential impact from related developments in \ngeopolitics, technology, and finance . \nBecause of this , the Kansas City Fed is especially active in monitoring this economic \nsector .  \n• We conduct and publish a quarterly Tenth District energy survey, tracking key \nindicators at oil and gas firms . \n\n3 \n • We co- host an annual Federal Reserve System Energy Research Workshop in \nconjunction with th is conference, and our economists conduct research on t imely \nenergy -related t opics such as productivity gains in the sector and the implications \nof gasoline price trends on inflation. \n \n• We also host regular energy roundtables across the region to gain insights and \ncontacts from  the energy sector . These types of events , and the relationships we \nare able to form , are exceptionally important to me as a regional Reserve Bank \npresident.  \n \n• Finally, we stay close to the energy sector by ensuring it is represented by \nindividuals serving on our boards of directors and advisory councils.   \n \nHowever, this annual conference is the capstone of our energy -related activities . It \nprovides us  with an opportunity to come together for a n in-depth discussion with academics, \nanalysts, financiers, and executives  to discuss  the pressing issues of the day . \nThe transition from fossil fuels to renewables is both reliant upon and an influencer of \nsupply chains and capital allocation, our key areas of focus at the conference this year . Our goal \nas the central bank is to better understand this transition, particularly how timely it will be, to bolster our own understanding of regional and national economic conditions.  \nOn behalf of President Logan of the Dallas Fed, we onc e again thank you for your \nparticipation in this program.  We are particularly interested in the views you will be sharing \ntoday and know that they will prove beneficial to our understanding of the road ahead."

It has been \nan honor to serve the nation’s central bank and to represent a region that includes all or part of \nseven states: Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico There is much to appreciate about working for the Federal Reserve , certainly including its \ndedicated workforce.  These talented people  who  say yes to working at the Federal Reserve on \nbehalf of the public feel the weight of the institution’s  mission and its impact on every American. \nAnd, during times of crisis, t hey are prepared to\n step up in extraordinary ways .  \nBecause the Federal Reserve’ s actions  affect people’s financial and economic situations , \nit is often in the headlines, including criticism, scrutiny and second guessing. One point of criticism has been the Fed’s structure, with 12 independent regional district banks \ncompl ementing the Board of Governors in Washington. S ome view the Fed’s decentralized \nstructure as an outdated, reflecting  a time when transportation and technology were far less \ndeveloped. Others argue accountability would be enhanced by alter ing the authorities of the \nregional R eserve B anks in favor of more central authority with the Federal Reserve Board. \nCurren t ideas about changing the Fed include reducing the number of regional R eserve B anks \nfrom 12 to 5, making Fed presidents political appointees , and requiring congressional access to \nReserve Bank records, including confidential supervisory information and sensitive personnel \ninformation. Th e tug-of-war, target ing reform of the central bank’s regional structure , \ngovernance , and authorit y, is not a new  one. It has been in play since the Federal Reserve’s \nfounding.  \nIn my comments this afternoon, I’ll talk about the Federal Reserve from the perspective \nof a career central banker in the nation’s heartland, focusing on issues related to policy deliberations , community banking, and the nation’s payment systems. Through this lens , I’ve \nwitnessed the ways th e Federal Reserve’s structure has figured prominently in securing the \npublic ’s trust  as it carries out its mandated objectives .  \n Trust and Confidence  \nOne of the most unique and important aspect s of the Federal Reserve’s decentralized \nstructure  is the participation of the American public in the ongoing operations  of the 12 R eserve \n\n2 \n Banks. The  Tenth Federal Reserve District  extend s from the plains of the Midwest to the Rocky \nMountains . Energy, agric ulture, transportation and logistics are dominant economic drivers. You \ncan drive hours through parts of the Tenth District and never see an office tower . (I apologize for \nbragging, but I love our wide -open spaces.)  \nBy virtue of its design as part of a federated system, the public is able to engage directly \nwith the Kansas City Fed and its branch offices by serving on our boards of directors  and \nadvisory groups. Th e governance of the regional R eserve B anks involves indi viduals from each \nDistrict who oversee the Banks’ operations and provide economic insights that inform monetary \npolicy deliberations.   \nOur boardroom s are places  where a labor leader and manufacturer; banker and non- profit \nexecutive; tribal leader and ener gy CEO, sit side by side. For a Fed policymaker, these \ndiscussions are obviously valuable. Not only do our directors  provide fiduciary oversight and \nimportant insight s on economic and financial conditions, but the y create a level of engagement \nand understa nding that would not otherwise exist. These are thoughtful discussions that may \nencompass topics ranging from the nuances of monetary policy to how economic conditions may \nbe affecting nonprofit donations  or certain segments of the workforce . My colleagues and I often \nreference what we’ve learned from these interactions as part of FOMC deliberations or in our \nspeeches where they can provide important real -world examples of the economy.  \nA few weeks ago , I attended year -end board meetings at each of our Kansas City District \noffices . During those meetings, we also recognize d the directors who were concluding their \nterms of Fed service.  At these meetings in Kansas City, Denver, Oklahoma City and Omaha, I \nlistened to these individuals describe their experience s of being invited inside our organization to \ngovern and to offer their insights and advice. Over the course of their terms, they’ve learned what we do, and why. They know that we check politics at the door and that our motive is to \nlisten and learn, so that we can understand and do our work on behalf of the public we serve. \nVery often, they tell us that this service has introduced them to people and perspectives that they \nwould otherwise not have experienced.\n For me , these were stron g reminders of the central bank’s \ndeep connections with a variety of Americans.  \nThe structure of the Fed was no accident.   \nCongress  had already established  two central banks that were unable to secure the \npublic’s trust , and their charters were not renewed.  What went wrong?  The First and Second \n\n3 \n Banks of the United States were isolated in what was then the national power center of \nPhiladelphia, and with governance structures that did not reflect the system of checks and \nbalances found in other important national institutions. Congress was keenly aware of these \napparent shortcomings as it considered a third attempt to form a central bank. This time, the design moved away from a highly centralized institution with concentrate d authority in favor of a \ndecentralized system that would share authority across the nation.\n1  \nThe Federal Reserve System reflects a blended structure of public oversight by the \nFederal Reserve Board of Governors over 12 quasi -privately chartered regional  Reserve Banks.  \nThese regional R eserve Banks and their affiliated branches have the obligation and the \nopportunity to meaningfully engage with the American public within each of their designated Districts.  \nWhen creating the first central bank of the United States, Alexander Hamilton was \nparticularly concerned that a more politically  controlled bank would prove to be an enticing  tool \nfor manipulation by interests  who would favor short -term political gain over  long- term national \nstability.\n2  Decades later, the Federal Reserve’s  governance and structure proved effective as the \nFOMC  under the leadership of Chair Paul Volcker  responded to high inflation . It is hard to \nimagine a scenario where a more politically  controlled central bank would have been willing to \ntake the very difficult and painful measures that ultimately proved necessary  to restor e economic \nand price stability for the nation.3 Today, the U .S. is again experiencing high inflation and the \nFederal Reserve is aggressive ly tightening monetary policy. And, once again, the benefits of \ncentral bank independence are apparent .   \nThe Fed’s system of checks and balances includes the FOMC structure  that has been in \nplace since the mid -1930s . Only five Reserve Bank presidents are voting members of the FOMC \nat any one time, leaving the seven publicly appointed Fed Governors in a majority position. This \narrangement promotes a diversity of views and healthy debate about policy options. In fact, an \nobserver wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between voters and nonvoters in any of the \ndiscussions because everyone participates equally in the meeting until the vote is taken.  \n \n1 Todd, Timothy.

Banking consolidation and concentration has resulted in a handful of G lobally \nSystemically I mportant Banks—referred to as GSIB s; a small number of mid- sized banks ; and , \nfewer, although still thousands of , small banks.4 Another notable change in the landscape is that \nnonbank financial services providers have increasingly captured a large share of the retail \nbanking business.  \nThere are no G SIBs headquartered i n the Tenth Federal Reserve District.  Instead, there \nare hundreds of regional and community banks. Across the region, households, small businesses \nand agricultural producers  rely heavily on local banking firms to supply credit and deposit \nservices.  The business models, economic conditions and banking needs of a farmer  in rural \nKansas or Nebraska differ significantly from those of a hotel owner in Jackson, Wyoming, a real \nestate developer in Denver,  an entrepreneur in New Mexico, a nonprofit in Missouri or a n \noilfield services company in Oklahoma City. \nAs a supervisor of these banks, the Federal Reserve’s understanding of the se unique \ncustomer needs and local economic conditions benefits enormously from its regional structure \nand engagement . Regional R eserve B anks also work closely with state banking regulators to \nfulfill supervisory mandates.  \nCommunity banker s serve on regional Reserve Bank boards  and a dvisory councils  to \ninform our understanding of local econom ies, the financial services  landscape , and concerns  of \nconsumers and communities across the country. Through this engagement, we also gain insights \nto the challenges facing these institutions as they provide acce ss to credit in their communities.  \nMuch  as the profiles and business models  of banks differ, so do the risks presented to the \nfinancial system. Too often, our banking regulations have lacked the nuance to fully account for \nthe differences in risk posed by small and regional banks compared to their larger peer s and non-\n \n4 Hanauer, Matt.

As a result, the compliance costs and burden affecting small \nbanks can be outsized relative to the benefits to financial stability and fair access to credit.  \nFinding the right c alibrat ion in today’s supervisory framework will be ne cessary to \nensure that community banks do not bear a disproportionate regulatory burden and can remain \ncompetitive as they meet the credit needs of the communities they serve. As I ’ve noted in other \nremarks , opportunities exist to further develop risk -focused approaches to supervision, to better \ntailor capital requirements, and to provide clearer guidance around innovation and alternative \nbusiness models. These steps might  better balance the costs of regulation with its benefits.   \nUnfortunately, I am not optimistic that the legislative aims of ending too big to fail will \nserve to bring more stability and prosperity to communities that depend on small banks. The \nnation’s largest banks continue to grow larger while holding less capital .5 At the same time, \nconsolidation among smaller banks is likely to continue , as regulatory burden persists in a \ncompetitive landscape of unregulated providers offering a variety of banking services . These \ntrends are not likely to be benign for small business es and communities across the country.  \n \nThe Payment System  \nFinally, the regional R eserve B anks have long played an important role in supporting the \nvarious ways Americans pay for goods and services. As Congress undertook the task of \ndesigning a central bank for the United States in 1913, it was clear that lawmakers intended for \nthe new institution to assist in improving the performance of the nation’s payment system. The \nday before the Federal Reserve Act was  signed, Representative Carter Glass of Virginia  \ncompared the flow of payments in the economy to “highways of commerce .” He used the \nmetaphor to illustrate how the Federal Reserve, through a number of regional R eserve B anks \nlocated across the count ry would provide currency to fuel the economy and serve as the hub of a \nnational clearing network for checks.6  \nSince then, the nation’s payments system has evolved dramatically. Electronic payments \nhave flourished, and households and businesses have grown accustomed to paying for things \nusing mobile phone apps, as well as credit and debit cards.  While the marketplace responded \n \n5 Pellerin, Sabrina. “ Bank Capital Analysis Semiannual Update. ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

Known as FedNow, this ser vice will \nenable payments to be made instantly and available anytime , including holidays and weekends. \nAs they have historically , the regional R eserve B anks will operate the FedNow service, \npromoting the payment system’s accessibility, safety  and efficiency. By making f unds available \nimmediately , consumers can pay utility bills  and rent, split the tab at a restaurant or rent \npayments with roommates , and small business owners will be able to pay their suppliers. \nImmediate access to funds could be particularly important for those on fixed incomes or living \npaycheck to paycheck.   \nImportantly, the Federal Reserve’s role will ensure equitable access to banks of all sizes \nnationwide by operating a real -time service for faster payments alongside the existing private -\nsector system. Public c ommenters have noted the importance of safety in faster payments , \nhighlighting the Federal Reserve's record of resiliency, especially during periods of stress. Th is \nnew retail payment infrastructure will support competition, decrease market concentration, and \nprovide a neutral platform for innovation.  \nConsistent with its public mission, the launch of th e FedNow service later this year \nrecognizes that ev eryone  deserves the same ability to make and receive payments immediately \nand securely, and that every  bank deserves the same opportunity to offer that service to its \ncommunity. FedNow will give banks of every size in every community across the country the \nopportunity to provide real -time payments to their customers.7 \n \nConclusion   \nThrough the compromises and choices made in designing the Federal Reserve System, \nCongress created a durable and cred ible public institution.

Sometimes those decisions can be unpopular. As innovation and structural \nchange reshape the economic landscape, all of us who work at the Fed understand that our policy \ndecisions  must take into consideration long- run public benefit and stability . Every decision and \naction must take into account potential unintended consequences. This is a powerful argument for cen tral bank independence.  \nAcross the regional F ederal R eserve B ank offices that help policymakers traverse a vast \ngeography, and in the meeting rooms at the Federal Reserve Board here in Washington , the \nAmerican public has the opportunity to interact every day with the central bank in ways that can build trust.  \nAnd at the end of the day, trust really is our only product."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nJanuary 6, 2023  \nCentral Exchange \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers,  or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you for that warm introduction. We’re pleased to host today’s Central Exchange \nprogram.  CX has been an important part of Kansas City’s success as it provides support for \nwomen to develop their leadership abilities and contribute to the momentum in our community.  \nOur partnership with CX has benefitted a number of women leader s here at the Kansas City Fed, \nincluding me . Your invitation in January 2012 was my first public speech as the new president of \nthe Kansas City Fed, and I’m honored to continue the tradition on the eve of my retirement later \nthis month  by looking back and looking ahead at the U.S. economy.   \n Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has pursued  its most aggressive tightening of \nmonetary policy in decades . Interest rates rose from zero to  4¼ perc ent in less than a year , and \nwithin only a few months of ending its large -scale asset purchase s, the process of shrinking its \nnearly $9 trillion  balance sheet  was initiated . Financial conditions in turn have tightened \nconsiderably.  Mortgage rates have roughly doubled, equity pri ces have fallen, and the dollar has \nappreciated.  In the conservative world of central banking, these are sharp and dramatic moves.  \nWhat makes this tightening even more extraordinary is that little of this was expected a \nyear ago.  Going into 2022, the Feder al Reserve anticipated that its policy rate would rise only \nmodestly over the course of the year  to a peak rate just above 2 percent by the end of 2024.  \nFinancial markets expected an even more gradual removal of monetary accommodation, with \nmarket participants assuming the Fed’s sizeable balance sheet would begin to shrink in the \nmiddle of 2024.  These forecasts generally assumed that monetary policy tighte ning this time \nwould look very much like the last time the Fed tightened monetary policy whe n the pace was \ngradual and drawn-out.   \nThat cycle started with an initial rate hike in December 2015 and ended three years later \nat a peak policy interest rate of 2½ percent.  The process of shrinking the balance sheet did not \nbegin until a full two years after the first interest rate increase.  Throughout that  period, the \nnarrative around tightening was less clear in terms of how the Federal Reserve was reacting to the data, and the financial market s reacted poorly to what now seem like minor changes in the \noutlook for policy.  \nWhat made the Fed toss out its previous playbook and pivot towards much more \naggressive action? The answer is, of course, i nflation.  Relatively early last year, it became \napparent that high inflation was going to prove more persistent than anticipated.  At the end of \n2021, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee , expected \n\n2 \n inflation to fall from 5¼ percent to 2½ percent in 2022, near the FOMC’s longer -run 2 percent \nobjective.  But instead of easing, inflation rose.  In the latest data, inflation is running at 5½ \npercent, well above those 2021 projections and, more importantly, far above the Fed’s objective.   \n \nHow did we get here? Shocks and shifting imbalances  \nGiven the importance of inflation in explaining the evolution of policy over the last year, \nthe outlook for inflation remains a central feature for any outlook of the economy overall.  In my \nview, today’s inflation dynamics reflect both unexpected shocks, such as the war in Ukraine, and \ncontinued—though shifting —imbalances in the economy.   \nThe war in Ukraine pushed up energy and  commodity food prices through most of 2022 . \nFrom February to June , the price of a gallon of gasoline increased almost 50 percent to $5 a \ngallon, and energy prices contributed almost one -fourth of  the increase in overall prices . Since \nJune, weaker expectations for global demand as well as a record 200-million -barrel  release from \nthe United States’ Strategic Petroleum Reserve have returned oil prices to about where they were \nbefore the conflict.  An initial spike in crop prices also has largely faded.  Given that the conflict \ncontinues unabated and that the possibility that energy and crop prices might rise again  remains , \nrenew ed pressure on overall inflation is certainly a very real risk.    \nMore fundamentally , the inflation we have seen over the past 18 months has been driven \nby imbalance s between supply and demand in t he economy.  Demand has been boosted by the \nextraordinary policy response to the pandemic, with a $6 trillion  fiscal expansion largely \nconsisting of transfers  to households and businesses.  At the same time , the economy’s ability to \nsupply goods and services  has been constrained by pandemic -related disruptions to production \nand transportation as well as labor shortages.  When demand exceeds supply, prices rise.  \nThe initial increase in inflation was importantly driven by higher goods prices, as shifting \nconsumption patterns and production disruptions led to large supply and demand imbalances for \ncertain durable goods.  An assumption that the supply of goods would recover was an important \nelement behind forecasts that called for falling inflation in 2022.  And indeed,  over the course of \n2022, supply chains  recovered , shortages of key parts —including many kinds of \nsemiconductors —were resolved, and shipping rates returned to pre -pandemic levels.  The long \nline of ships waiting off the Port of Long Beach has disappe ared. And as expected, goods prices \n\n3 \n have started to moderat e, with prices (excluding food and energy) falling over the past two \nmonths .  \nEven as the prices for goods have begun to decline , other prices related to services have \nstrengthened.  Underlying the strength of services prices has been an extremely  tight labor \nmarket, with the demand for employees by businesses far exceeding the supply of willing \nworkers . The unexpected degree and persistence of labor market tightness has led to a shift in \nprice p ressures from goods to labor -intensive services. In other words, ongoing inflationary \npressures still reflect imbalances between supply and demand, but those imbalances have shifted \nas the tightness in product markets has given  way to tightness in the labor market.  \nDemand explains part of the tightness of the labor market, with employers post ing 1.7 \nvacancies for every person reporting to be looking for work.  However, surprisingly weak labor \nsupply has also been an important factor . Workforce engagement continues to disappoint, and \nthe labor force participation rate remains more than  1 percentage point below pre -pandemic \nlevels.  The decline in participation is now concentrated among those older than 55 and likely \nreflects early retirements and health concern s, decisions which can be sticky and difficult to \nreverse.  \n \nPolicy implications for 2023 \n While the recent data on inflation has been encouraging,  eliminating  the imbalances that \nhave been driving prices higher  will be required to restore price stability . So far , the increase in \ninterest rates has worked to slow demand growth,  allow ing supply to catch up, particularly for \ngoods . Our regional contacts note that higher interest rates have slowed the housing market  \ndramatically, both in regard to sales and new residential construction.  Speculative commercial \nreal estate projects have also largely stopped, though firms have reportedly continued with projects related to their own expansion or upgrades.  The shortages o f lumber that drove up \nconstruction prices in 2020 and 2021 have disappeared and prices have fallen.    \nBut even as goods prices have started to decline, services prices continue to rise , boosted  \nby a tight labor market.  How much additional tightening will be needed to bring inflation back to \n2 percent remains an essential aspect of the Federal Reserve’s deliberations . \nThe longer inflation remains above its  2 percent objective , the greater the chance that \nhigher inflation becomes embedded in the expectations of workers, producers, and consumers . \n\n4 \n History has shown that once inflation become s ingrained in public expectations , it can be very \ncostly  to combat .   \nThrough its aggressive action over the past year , the Federal Reserve has demonstrated its \ncommitment to restoring price stability.  This may explain why measures of longer -run inflation \nexpectations have remained relatively stable even as realized inflation has proven to be \nstubbornly high.    \nAs policymakers judge the appropriate path of policy  over the coming year, a number of \neconomic uncertainties  are likely to confront them . For one , the global outlook is highly \nunsettled.  Disruptions in European energy markets threaten production and dampe n consumer \nsentiment, with many forecasters suggesting that a recession in the euro area is unavoidable.  In \nChina, the pandemic remains a threat, both to public health and to economic activity.  Overall, the \nglobal outlook does not suggest much of a buffer for the U.S. economy if growth were to slow \nappreciably more here.      \nAnother source of uncertainty for policymakers is the tremendous amount of liquidity \nthat remains in the financial system.  Households for example are holding an additional $4  trillion \nin currency and checking accounts relative to pre-pandemic levels.1 This additional money \ncoincides with a sharp increase in saving during the pandemic, as spending was curtailed, and \ngovernment transfer programs attempted to preserve household incomes.   \nHow households manage this additional excess saving over time could have important \nimplications for the  path of policy.  If they decide to hang on to higher levels of liquidity, perhaps \nout of a renewed sense of caution given the experience of the pandemic shock, then the effect on \nthe economy, inflation, and policy could be minim al. If instead , this  higher liquidity allows \nhouseholds to boost spending,  the outcome could be continued pressure on imbalances and \ninflation.  Such a scenario might call for further increase s in interest rates to incentivize saving \nrather  than spending .  \nAs policymakers consider the path of interest rates, they also will be following through \non plans  to significantly reduc e the size of the Fed’s balance sheet . Currently, up to $ 95 billion \nof assets are rolling  off the balance sheet  every month as they mature.  It is important that these \nreductions continue so that the central bank ’s balance sheet  is no larger than needed to carry out \n \n1 From the Board of Governors Flow of Funds  data , household holdings of checkable deposits and currency \nincreased from $1.2 trillion at the end of 2019 to $5.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2022.   \n\n5 \n its operating regime in an effective and efficient manner , thereby minimizing  its footprint and \ninfluence in financial markets.  Based on the Federal Reserve’s previous experience, reducing the \nsize of its balance sheet can be a slow and challenging process.2   \nFinally, policymakers will undoubtedly face more complicated choices and difficult \ncommunications as the tradeoffs between inflation and employment become more apparent.  \nUncertainty around the path of policy could rise once the public and markets start evaluating \nhow the Federal Reserve is weighing inflation relative to a softening labor market in its po licy \ndecisions.   \nLonger -term, reflections on the recent surge in inflation might serve to shift the policy \ndiscussion about growth in the United States, from the demand -focused view that prevailed over \nthe past two decades to a greater acknowledgement of the structural factors affecting and impeding growth.  Prior to the pandemic, economic growth considerations had focused almost \nexclusively on the weakness of demand, as supposedly evidenced by low interest rates and low inflation.  This narrative argued that if demand could be boosted, supply would be forthcoming, \nand growth would pick up.  However, faced with an almost unprecedented surge in demand \nfollowing the policy response to the pandemic, the supply side of the economy has revealed itself as a binding c onstraint.  After decades of associating slow growth with insufficient demand, the \ncurrent episode suggests supply side factors affecting the economy might be less nimble than thought.  Future reviews of the Federal Reserve’s policy framework could offer the opportunity to \nexplore this dynamic  and consider the implications for monetary policy . \n  \n \n2 Gulati, Chaitri,  and A.

The consideration of differences across \nindividuals, industries, and geographies within an economy is particularly relevant for  \npolicymakers today as central banks a round  the world confront high inflation and tighten policy.   \nAs the depth of research at th is conference suggest s, the study of heterogeneity and \nmacroeconomics is a rich and active field.  Models incorporating heterogeneity are necessarily  \ncomplex, but as this conference has highlighted , progress  has been made in recent years.  That \nsaid, and perhaps as a consequence  of the complexity of the models, the importance of \nheterogeneity can often appear to be overlooked in macroeconomics . In my experience as a \ncentral banker , regardless of the state of the academic literature, it has long played an important \nrole in policym aking and continues to do so today.    \nFrom the perspective of the United States , one could argue that the structure of the \nFederal Reserve System itself is recognition  of the importance of heterogeneity.  In establishing \n12 distinct regional  banks, the Federal Reserve Act recognized  that it was important to monitor a \ndiversity of conditions across the nation  and to ensure that a range of communities were \nconnected to the central bank . Monetary policy can affect industries and populations  differently, \nand for a country like the United States, which has a history of skepticism surrounding \ncentralized authority, it is critical for diverse regions of the country to have a voice in the making \nof policy.  \nThe benefits of a central bank that is engaged  with diverse stakeholders are also evident \nin the Federal Reserve’s  focus on local and targeted outreach and engagement  with communities \nacross the country . For example, at the Kansas City  Fed we hold regular symposiums, \nroundtables, and advisory g roup meetings with representatives from diverse industries, \ngeographies , and cultural and economic backgrounds.  Perhaps most well -known  have been our \nFed Listens events where the Federal Reserve welcomes voices from a wide range of \norganizations  — unions, small business  owners , residents of low - and moderate -income \ncommunities, Native American leaders,  and others  — to hear how monetary policy affects them \nand their  local  communities. In addition, each Reserve Bank is governed by a Bo ard of Directors \nthat is representative of the range of community, business,  and labor interests in their region. It is \nat this regional  level where the central bank build s trust and enhances communicati on in ways \n\n \n2 \n  \nthat resonate across a range of audiences. In this regard, heterogeneity is central to the way the \nFederal Reserve operates.  \nI will focus  today  on two additional aspects of heterogeneity and monetary policy. First, \nhow it affects the conduct of monetary po licy, as distributional differences obscured by \naggregate measures can be important for how we interpret the data and inform  policy decisions. \nAnd second, how the conduct of monetary policy can affect heterogeneity, as monetary policy \ncan have distribution al consequences by affecting different segments of the population with \nvarying intensity.   \n \nThe Importance of Looking Within  Aggregates  \nStarting with the importance of heterogeneity in the conduct of monetary policy, let me \noffer  a very real and current ex ample  from the United States’ experience . During the pandemic, \nthe United States adopted an extraordinary fiscal stimulus, roughly $6 trillion, a large proportion \nof which consisted of direct transfers to households and businesses. Relative to previous \nprograms, the pandemic stimulus was distributed widely across the economy and , consequently , \nled to a sharp improvement in household balance sheets, with households estimated to have \naccumulated roughly $2. 3 trillion in excess saving s relative to pre -pandemic levels.1 \nAs the Fed tightens monetary policy with the aim of closing the imbalance between \ndemand and supply that has pushed up inflation, the dynamics of th ese excess savings and the \ndistribution of th ese saving s will be key fac tors shaping the outlook for output, inflation,  and \ninterest rates.  Higher saving s provide an important buffer to households that can ease the \nadjustment to economic disruptions.  However, high sav ings could also provide a further impetus \nto consumption as the central bank attempts  to slow the pace of demand growth . Higher saving s \ncould lessen a precautionary pullback in consumption , and it could well take a higher interest \nrate for some time to convince households to hold onto their saving s rather than spen d them  \ndown and add to inflationary pressure.   \nHow saving s affects the outlook is going to be importantly affected by the distribution of \nthese excess saving s across households.  Heterogeneity is going to matter.  If the se saving s are \nconcentrated in the upper brackets of the wealth distribution, a group that tends to spend a \n \n1 Aditya Aladangady, David Cho, Laura Feiveson and Eugenio Pinto. “ Excess Savings during the COVID -19 \nPandemic .” FEDS Notes . Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Oct. 21, 2022.  \n\n \n3 \n  \nsmaller share of their wealth and income, higher saving s might provide little additional \nmomentum to consumption.  However, if saving s are spread more evenly acros s the population, \nincluding households with a higher propensity to spend out of wealth, then the effect on the \npersistence of consumption is likely to be larger.   \nCurrently, available data suggests that saving s remain elevated across the wealth \ndistributio n. However, recent evidence also suggests that lower -income households are running \ndown their buffers quickly.  This is to say that monitoring the distribution of saving s is likely to \nbe important as we think about the course of the economy and the path of policy.  \nWhile high savings  are likely to provide momentum to consumption and require higher \ninterest rates , the fact that households are wealthier, less financially constrained,  and better \ninsured  is a positive development . Even so , bringing down inflation will require incentivizing  \nsaving s over consumption . The short -run pain from monetary contraction is lowest when demand \nmoderation  is progressive across the income distribution. Moderat ing demand growth  by \nencouraging high -income households to sa ve more with higher interest rates  would certainly be \npreferable  to crashing the consumption of lower -income households.  \nAcknowledging heterogeneity can also improve our understanding of the  forces \ncontributing to elevated inflation . Overall wage growth re mains strong, reflecting what by many \nmeasures has been a historically tight labor market.  With inflation recently rotating from goods \nto services prices, as supply chain disruptions ease and the labor market remains tight, \nunderstanding wage growth is lik ely to be important for understanding the overall path of \ninflation.   \nNominal wage growth for the median worker is tracking at 6 percent according to the \nAtlanta Fed’s Wage Tracker, but this aggregate number masks an importan t difference between \njob stayers and job movers. The median worker who switches jobs sees 7. 3 percent wage growth, \nwhich is substantially higher than those who stay put at their current job. Furthermore, the rate at \nwhich people switch jobs has increased si gnificantly, especially for prime -age workers, whose \naverage tenure at their current job fell by about three  months from 2020 to 2022. With labor \nmarkets historically tight, a calmer labor market with fewer quits and less churn could lower job \nswitching an d reduce inflationary pressures by lowering nominal wage growth.  \nAdditionally, the first half of 2022 saw a substantial reduction in average labor \nproductivity. If weaker labor markets force people to stay put longer, then they may become \n\n \n4 \n  \nmore proficient , and labor productivity growth may provide some inflationary relief in the near \nterm. In addition, many of my District contacts report problems with low worker engagement, \nwhich is a drag on productivity. If workers who no longer see their current job as replaceable  \nbecome more engaged, they may also become more productive.  \n \nThe Distributional Effects of Monetary Policy  \nTurning to the differential effects of monetary policy on heterogeneous groups , we \nshould understand that  our policies affect different gro ups in different ways.  Central bankers  are \nlargely constrained to using blunt tools, limiting the ability to fine -tune monetary policy . Still, \nthere are potential distributional consequences of central bank policies .  \nFor example, in the United States, e ven after some recent declines, house prices in the \nremain 25 percent above their pre -pandemic trend. This is partly , though certainly not wholly,  \ndue to the magnitude and duration of quantitative easing implemented by the Fed from 2020  \nthrough 20 22, especially the purchase of $1.4 trillion in mortgage -backed securities. Though the \ngoal of these  purchases was not to explicitly support house prices, it likely  had such an effect . \nHow are the benefits of supporting house prices distributed? People who  already own houses, \nwho tend to be wealthier and older, certainly gain. However, their gain may be at the expense of \nothers  who cannot get their foot in the door when prices are extremely high, even if rates are also \nlow. Loan-to-income and loan-to-value limits on mortgages are more likely to bind for people \nwithout large down payments , such as  young people at the beginning of their careers , and others  \nwith relatively low incomes.  \nTo close , heterogeneity matters for monetary policy , both in h ow we interpret the data \nand think about the outlook , as well as in the effect that our policy actions have on  the economy . \nAcknowledg ing that policy can affect diverse groups  differently is an important piece of building \nand maintaining central bank credi bility.  While it is tempting to simplify our analysis through  \naggregate measures, we should always be aware of the importance of individuals in setting the \ncourse for the economy and in bearing the consequences of policy  decisions."

Today I will offer an outl ook for the U.S. \neconomy and my views on monetary policy. I’ll set the stage for those perspectives by looking \nfirst at the impact of developments in energy markets .   \n Energy Prices on the Rise \nEnergy prices have been on a wild ride this  year. Brent crude oil ran up above $120 a \nbarrel mid -year before falling back to $95  a barrel . Even at the lower level, it is more than 10 \npercent higher than the price a year ago  and far above  the roughly $60 a barrel average price that \nheld over the five years prior to the  pandemic. The moves in natural gas prices have been even \nmore dramatic , with domestic natural gas prices doubling through the middle of this year, before \nretreating to a lev el below where they were last October (and even briefly falling below zero at \none trading hub in recent weeks) . However, like oil, natural gas prices remain far above pre-\npandemic averages.    \nSimilar to  higher prices in the broader economy, the increase in energy prices primarily \nreflects a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. Resurgent demand following the fading of pandemic lockdowns has run into a constrained supply side . Somewhat surprisingly, \nthe oil and gas extraction and petroleum product s industries have shown the least recovery of any \nsector in the U.S. economy, both producing at about 60 percent of pre -pandemic levels . This is  \neven worse than the  supply -chain addled motor vehicle dealer sector, where output is running at \nabout 70 percent of pre -pandemic levels. The imbalance between supply and demand in the oil \nand gas sectors has unsurprisingly pushed up prices.   \nOf course, the increase in prices is not sole ly due to lagging production in the United \nStates. Russia’s invasion of Uk raine has upended the entire global system of energy trade , not \njust for oil, but for almost every form of energy. Russia accounts for more than 10 percent  of \nglobal oil exports, close to 20 percent  of global natural gas exports, and about 15 percent  of \nglobal coal exports —with  Europe being its primary  market. This heavy reliance pushed \nEuropean natural gas prices to historic highs , and the economic consequences of the energy \n\n2 \n supply shock are likely be sizeable for European economies.  In addition  to the  disruption of \ntrade, sanctions are likely to dent global production. T he International Energy Agency estimates \na potential loss of 2  percent  of world oil supply as sanctions hit Russian production .  \nHowever, it is important to note that e nergy prices were on an upward trend before \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine . For example, the anemic response of the U.S. oil and gas sector to \nhigher prices reflects years of relatively low investment due partly to a shift in investment \ntowards other sources of energy, as wel l as increased capital discipline following the industry’s \npoor returns  during previous boom -bust cycles .  \n \nEnergy Prices and Outlook  \nHow will developments in energy markets affect the outlook  for growth and inflation?  \nRetail gasoline prices reached all -time highs earlier this year, and although prices at the pump \nhave come down, gas prices continue to boost  year-over -year inflation . In addition, the  price of \ngasoline is  perhaps the most salient price in the economy,  and fluctuations in gas prices can play \nan outsized role in sha ping consumers’ inflation expectations. Currently , longer -term inflation \nexpectations appear to be anchored, but if expectations were to shift, inflation could become \nmore persistent and difficult to control. Highlighting this risk , research by my staff shows that an \nincrease in salient prices, such as gasoline, can have an amplified effect on near -term inflation \nexpectations in an already high -inflation environment .1 Energy prices can also affect inflation as \nan input cost to other industries, like airfares and transportation costs.   \nWhat about the implications of higher energy prices for U.S. growth? H igher oil prices \nforce households to spend a larger share of thei r income on gasoline, lowering their spending on \nother goods and services. Although it is a drag for everyone, it is a larger headwind for lower -\nincome households that spend a higher share of income on energy. Overall, the  negative effect of \nhigher energy prices on consumption can be partly  offset by a positive effect on capital \ninvestment  in the energy sector . For example, U.S. oil investment boosted total business \ninvestment growth by about 1 percentage point  from 2010 to 2014, when growth-oriented oil \ncompanies kept increasing their capacity as oil prices surged. In this cycle , the response of \n \n1 Nida  Ca kir Melek, Fra ncis M. Dillion, a nd A. Lee Smith . “Can Higher Ga soline Prices Set Off a n Inflationary \nSpira l? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  Economic Review . Forthcoming.  \n\n3 \n energy investment to higher prices has been lackluster, offering less of an offset to the negative \nconsumption effect s. \nThe more severe impact of the energy shock o n Europe, particularly the disruption of \nnatural gas shipments, will likely also have spillover effects for the U.S. economy. Natural gas is \nan important energy source in Europe, and the effects of a shortage could be particularly notable  \nfor Germany’s gas -intensive chemicals, paper, and metals production sectors. Complex global \nsupply chains can propagate and amplify such disruptions , a lesson learned during the pandemic.   \n \nThe Outlook for Inflation and the Economy   \nThis energy shock hit s during a time of already heightened economic uncertainty.  \nAlthough growth has slowed notably this year, the labor market remains tight, and inflation has \nbeen high and persistent. Prices , as measured by the CPI,  increased 7.7 percent over the 12  \nmonths ending in October , down from, but still uncomfortably close  to, the 9 percent  40-year \nhigh recorded in June. While lower energy prices have pulled down overall inflation  in recent \nmonths, inflation (excluding energy  prices ) ran at 6.3 percent in October  and has been stuck \nstubbornly at about that level throughout 2022.    \nA notable development in recent months has been the rotation of price pressures from \ngoods to services. Goods inflation led the increase in inflation in 2021 and through the beginning of this year , as consumers stuck at home upgraded their living spaces and pushed demand for \ndurable goods up against an impaired supply side, snarled by production disruptions and logistical jams. More recently, t he combination of easing in supply chain disruptions, slowing \nglobal growth, and higher interest rates have contributed to a deceleration in core goods prices.     \nIn contrast, services prices have firmed, with monthly increases that continue to be \namong the largest in decades. In addition, t he rise in  services prices has been broad -based.  \nWhereas goods demand has slowed, and the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index has signaled \ncontraction  for the first time since 2020, services activity in the District continues to expand , \ncontributing to a tight labor market \nOne compounding factor in the tightness of labor markets and the rise in prices  has been \nthe recent poor performance of labor productivity. Output per hour decline d at the fastest pace on \nrecord in the first half of the year. While many factors could be be hind this decline, including \nchanges in the composition of employment, at this point it is uncertain how persistent this \n\n4 \n disappointing productivity growth will be . We asked our District survey contacts about what \nfactors might be behind the declines in labor productivity. Th e results point to labor mismatch as \nan important factor, with about  a third of our contacts reporting a less -qualified workforce \ncompared to pre -pandemic. In addition, the majority of firms reported increased spending and \nresources devo ted to employee training.  \nThere have been some early indicators that the labor market might be cooling, with \nreported vacancies trending down even as month -to-month changes remain volatile. The rate at \nwhich workers are quitting jobs is also declining, suggesting that workers are becoming a bit less \nconfident that if they leave a job, they’ll easily find a new one.  Wage pressures will eventually \nrespond to a cooling labor market , but with a lag. Analysis from my staff suggests that wage \ngrowth crests and starts to fall about a year after the Kansas City Labor Market Conditions \nIndicators ( LMCI ) activity indic ator peaks. Even with the indic ator turning down in October , we \nmay still have some time before we see a sustained cooling of wage growth.  \nProlonged high inflation could eventually lead to a shift in inflation expectations, a \ndevelopment that would make inflation more persistent and even harder to address , a lesson \nlearned at some cost during the Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s . However, most indicators \nsuggest that even as near -term inflation expectations have risen sharply, expectations are for \ninflation to return to near the Fed’s 2 percent objective  in the medium te rm. Notably, while every \nparticipant in the most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters marked up their expectations \nfor 2022 inflation (and some substantially so), their forecasts of longer -term inflation \nexpectations have scarcely budged.  \nWith inflation still elevated and likely to be persistent, monetary policy clearly has more \nwork to do. Earlier hopes that improving supply chains and easing production disruptions would \nsignificantly reduce inflation are fading . As price pressures have rotated  from goods to services, \nthe impetus for inflation has moved from tight product markets to tight labor markets. The lower \nresponsiveness of services consumption (and prices) to interest rate increases highlights the \nchallenging dynamics the Federal Reserve faces  as it acts  to restor e price stability.  \n \nOutlook for Monetary Policy \nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve has aggressively tighten ed monetary policy . The \npolicy rate has increased 375  basis points, the fastest pace  since the Fed began to explicitly  target  \n\n5 \n interest rates.  After more than doubling the size of its balance sheet during the pandemic, t he Fed \nis now allowing up to $95 billion in Treasuries and m ortgage -backed securities to mature  every \nmonth, shrinking its asset holdings and putting further upward pressure on interest rates . More \nbroadly, t ighter monetary policy has fed through to tighter financial conditions. And t ighter \nfinancial conditions are showing through to the real econom y as demand eas es, especially in \ninterest rate sensitive sectors, such as housing and  durable goods .   \nStill, imbalances in the economy  and the labor market  persist , and inflation pressures \nhave yet to let up , suggesting monetary policy and financial conditions must continue to tighten.   \nWith the direction of policy clear , the key questions are how far and how quickly will interest \nrates  have to rise ? \nWhile it is tempting to speculate on how high rates might need to go, the degree of \ntightening necessa ry will only be determined by observing the dynamics of the economy and \ninflation and can not be predetermined by theory or pre -pandemic benchmarks. For example, t he \nsensitivity of the economy to interest rates can shift for any number of reasons, and  judging \nsufficiently restrictive policy could well mean seeing the economy and inflation begin to respond \nin convincing ways . Some have argued that a minimum standard for a restrictive policy is a \npositive inflation -adjusted, or real, rate of interest. Currently, survey evidence indicates that \nconsumers expect inflation to run at about 5 percent over the next year, above the current 3¾ to 4 percent target range for the policy interest rate, suggesting that the real interest rate remains \nnegative . This measu re would point to considerably higher rates than current levels . \nOne factor complicating the determination of how high rates will have to go is the large \nstock of liquid savings on household balance sheets. During the pandemic, fiscal policy transferred a tremendous amount of balance sheet capacity from the government to households \nand business . The government’s borrowing was the private sector ’s saving.  How households \ntreat this accumulation of  saving will be important for shaping the outlook for output, inflation, \nand interest rates. It could very well require a higher interest rate for some time to convince households to hold onto this saving rather than to spend it down and add to the inflati onary \nimpulse.  \nWith inflation and a tight economy suggesting further increases in interest rates are \nnecessary, at what pace should rates be increased?  With a firm commitment to return inflation to \ntarget, the pace of hikes is less important than the stren gth and communication of this \n\n6 \n commitment. I continue to see several advantages for a steady and deliberate approach to raising \nthe policy rate.   \nA more measured approached to rate increases may be particularly useful as \npolicymakers judge the economy’s re sponse to higher rates. Already, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s policy actions have led to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. The yield on \nthe 10-year Treasury bond has increased 26 0 basis points since January, the fastest increase in \nalmost 40 years. Mortgage rates have more than doubled. The dollar has appreciated 10 percent \nagainst a wide range of currencies, and stock market indices have declined by about 2 0 precent.  \nThese are big moves in financial markets, seen previously in only the most extraordinary times.   \nThe speed at which rates have increased has likely contributed to the marked increase in \npolicy rate uncertainty, if only by widening the range of possible action. Uncertainty around the policy rate is currently very high, in part reflecting an unsettled outlook, but also importantly, \nuncertainty over the central bank’s  reaction function. I expect some of the increase in uncertainty \ncan be attributed  to an aggressive front -loading strategy  of policy tightening . As the tightening \ncycle continues, now is a particularly important time to avoid unduly contribut ing to financial \nmarket volatility, especially as volatility stresses market liquidity with the potential to complicat e \nbalance sheet run -off plans.  \nRestoring price stability is essential to the nation’s long -run economic growth prospects.  \nWithout question, monetary policy must respond decisively to high inflation to avoid embedding \nexpectations of future inflation. In my view, a stead fast commitment to returning inflation to the \nCommittee’s target is important. So is the pace of rate increases. Navigating the path ahead in \nthis time of uncertainty and volatility will require attention to both ."

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \nSeptember 9, 2022 \nPeterson Institute for International Economics  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  \nTwo weeks ago, the Kansas City Fed hosted its annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy \nSymposium . The theme of this year’s program focused on, “Reassessing Constraints on the \nEconomy and Policy.”     \nAn elaboration of constraints has been a valuable contribution of the field of economics.  \nOpportunity costs, comparative advantage, and the Phillips Curve are  all defined around the \nexistence of constraints and limits.   \nHowever, over the past quarter -century  the economic conversation has been dominated \nby concerns  over insufficient demand , and supply constraints faded  into the background.  \nSupporting this shift, recent  recessions —up until the pandemic —have largely been attributed to \nfinancial disruptions related to demand being support ed by unsustainable asset allocations . This \nis different from  the supply shocks and inflationary dynamics that had driven ea rlier post-war \nrecessions.    \nThe economic recovery following the pandemic shock has brought supply considerations \nback to center stage.  Bottlenecks and shortages related to pandemic disruptions have limited \nsupply and driven  up prices.  More generally, strong demand , supported by a historic level of \nfiscal and monetary accommodation , has pushed on  the capacity limits of the economy.  With \ndemand no longer insufficient , supply constraints have become a key factor in the outlook for \neconomic acti vity.  \nThe policy response to the pandemic raises additional questions about constraints.  The \nextraordinary fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic appeared to redraw the boundaries \nof policy . Innovative  and expansive fiscal programs pushed debt -to-GDP ratios to new highs  as \ncentral bank balance sheets expanded rapidly with little discussion of constraints.  \nAgainst this backdrop, I’ll spend a few minutes on the current outlook for the economy \nand for policy.  On the economy, I will argue that the constraints revealed by the pandemic are \nlikely to be with us for some time, perpetuating imbalances , contributing to inflation, and \nrequiring a sustained policy response.  I will also argue that constraints continue to bind policy , \nwith a focus on the bala nce sheet and efforts to significantly reduce it from its current elevated \nlevel.  \n \n \n\n2 \n The Economic Outlook  \nHigh inflation is certainly a sign that constraints are binding  the economy . Prices, \nmeasured on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increased 6.3  percent in the 12 months \nending in July, down from  June’s 40 -year high, but still far above the FOMC’s 2 percent \nobjective.  Energy prices have played an outsized role in inflation over the past year . Oil prices \nrose with the war in Ukraine but fell back over the summer  as recession fears grew . Food prices \nhave also contributed to the rise in inflation . In part, this is related to  the run up in agricultural \ncommodity prices  connected to  the war in Ukraine, but it is also a result of  stressed growing \nconditions in many regions around the world, including in the western portion of the Kansas City \nFed’s region.   \nHowever,  it is not just food and energy prices  driving inflation . Excluding  food and \nenergy , core PCE prices hav e risen 4.6 percent over the past 12  months, also near a 40-year high.  \nThe rise in inflation  has been very broad-based, with almost every category of consumption \nrecording an increase in prices  and about one -third  of categories showing increases far above \ntrend .  \nThe widespread  nature of inflation suggests that a tight economy is driving price \npressures rather than solely individual supply disruptions and shocks. Two main factors appear to \nbe contributing to this tightness. First, as the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand \nsurged , underpinned by a tremendous amount of fiscal and monetary poli cy support. The federal \ngovernment has provided roughly $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus since the start of the pandemic. \nMonetary policy was also very accommodative, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero \nand added over $4 trillion to its balance  sheet . While consumption growth has moderated this \nyear, the level of demand remains strong, particularly for goods.  For example, the consumption \nof durable goods continues to run about 20 percent above its pre -pandemic trend.   \nA second factor boosting inflation has been the inability of the supply side of the \neconomy to keep up with the strength of demand.  At first,  the lack of supply seemed to largely \nreflect temporary disruptions related to the closing and reopening the econom y. However, now it \nseems increasingly apparent that there has been  persistent damage to the supply side of the \neconomy as a result of the pandemic.    \n\n3 \n Constraints on the Economy  \nThree factors coming out of the pandemic seem likely to present a continued drag on \neconomic supply:  continuing  damage to global supply chains, the quick destruction of capacity \nin the service sector, and long -lasting damage to workforce engagement and labor force \nparticipation.  I will quickly review these issues.  \nThe sh ock of the pandemic shutdowns and the sudden shift to goods consumption \ncontinues to reverberate through the global economy, with shortages and logistical snarls still \nplagu ing many industries . The war in Ukraine, disruptions to E uropean energy supply, and \ndrought conditions across the globe that have disrupted both agriculture and inland transportation \nas rivers run dry  have only contributed further to these supply disruptions.  There has been so me \ndiscussion that recent shocks could elicit  permanent changes in product ion processes.  As the \nefficiency of just -in-time production and global networks gives way to the accumulation of \nunproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency over efficiency, the damage  to global \nproductivity could prove permanent.   \nA second supply factor contributing to the tightness of the economy, particularly in the \nservice sector, has been the quick destruction of capacity in a number of industries.  Services \ninflation has picked up to 4.6  percent, the fastest pace in decades, even as services consumption \nremains 4 percent below its pre -pandemic trend.  Elevated inflation suggests the sector is at \ncapacity, although relative to pre -pandemic levels there would still appear to  be considerable \nslack . One concrete example of a  relatively persistent reduction in capacity appears to be playing \nout in the airline industry . Airfares have climbed 15 percent above pre -pandemic levels as strong \ndemand has run up on  a system that has yet to fully recover.   \nLabor markets are a third  factor shaping the outlook for the supply side of the economy.  \nWhile employment growth has been robust, and the unemployment  rate has fallen to near record \nlows, workforce engagement conti nues to lag.  The labor force participation rate remains one \npercentage point below pre -pandemic levels, representing roughly 2 million missing workers.  \nThe decline in participation is now concentrated among those older than 55 and likely reflects \nearly retirements  and health concerns , decisions which can  be sticky and difficult to reverse . In \ncontrast, the pandemic -induced decline in participation among prime age women , likely \nreflecting disruptions to dependent care, has now c ompletely reversed , with participation by \nprime age wom en near an all -time  high in July.  \n\n4 \n An additional  factor holding back the ability of supply to ease inflation pressures has \nbeen the abysmal recent performance of productivity.  Labor productivity , as measured by output \nper hour , declined almost 6 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year. It was  the largest \ntwo-quarter decline on record.1 The sharp falloff in measured productivity is not surprising when \nwe consider that the economy added 3 million new workers in the first half of the year even as \nthe level of output (as defined by GDP) declined 1 percent at an annual rate.  Looking back over \nhistory, GDP has almost never declined for two quarters even as the recorded numbe r of hours \nworked has increased.2  \n \nMonetary Policy Considerations  \nTo repeat a phrase that has become common through the pandemic, we are in \nunprecedented times.  The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy cannot, of course, reverse the \nsupply shocks or loosen the constraints that have boosted inflation. It can, however, moderate the pace of demand growth to narrow imbalances in the economy and reduce price pressures. By raising interest rates , the Federal Reserve can help manage demand growth, in part by \nincentivizing saving over consumption and also through the effect on asset prices and financial market conditions.  \nBy taking deliberate policy actions, the Federal Reser ve can also prevent high inflation \nfrom becoming embedded in price - and wage-setting behavior. For many workers, recent wage \nincreases have not kept pace with price inflation. Declining real, or inflation -adjusted, wages are \nnot sustainable and could lead workers and businesses to build high inflation into wage contracts, to the long -term detriment of the labor market. Instead, experience has shown that low and stable \ninflation is most conducive to promoting sustainable growth and to maintaining a strong la bor \nmarket that benefits households, workers, and businesses.  \nSince March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  has increased the policy rate \nby 225 basis points, and, beginning this month,  has accelerated the process of shrinking the Fed’s \nbalance sheet. In response to these actions, and with expectations of further rate hikes, broader financial conditions have tightened , including mortgage and other borrowing rates.  However, \n \n1 In a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium (Fernald a nd Li , 2022 ), the authors a rgue that the \nrecent decline in productivity reflects a return to the lackluster pre -pandemic trend.    \n2 Of course, it is possible that the data has been mismeasured, and a  number of  commentators have noted that \nalternative measures of economic output , such as Gross Domestic Income,  paint a more upbeat picture than GD P. \n\n5 \n with the policy rate still relatively low , the balance sheet still  near $9 trillion , and imbalances in \nthe economy still holding up inflation , the case for continuing to remove policy accommodation \nremains  clear -cut. The key questions are by how much and how quickly.  \nOn the question of how much further tighten ing is req uired, I believe only careful \nobservation of the economy will provide the answer.  As unsatisfying as it might be, weighing in \non the peak policy rate is likely just speculation at this point.  The often -discussed  neutral rate of \ninterest, or the tipping poi nt between accommodative and restrictive policy , is an  unobserved and \npotentially unstable benchmark , potentially undermining its value as either a guide for policy or \npublic communication.  Whether any level of the interest rate is accommodative or restrictive will \ndepend on the interest  sensitivity of the economy, which could vary for any number of reasons.  \nFor example, as spending shifted away from services toward relatively interest-sensitive  housing \nand durable goods during the pandemic, the economy may have become more susceptible to \nhigher interest rates. However, the significant accumulation of liquid savings during the \npandemic could work in the opposite direction, dampen ing the effects of higher interest rates on \nspending and ultimately inflation.  \nWe will have to determine the course of our policy through observation rather than \nreference to theoretical model s or pre -pandemic trends . Given the  likely  lags in the pas sthrough \nof tighter monetary policy  to real econom ic conditions , this argues for steadiness  and \npurposefulness  over speed.    \nThe path of policy is also likely to influence plan s to shrink the Federal Reserve’s \nelevated balance sheet.  The economy is in unfamiliar territory, with a combinatio n of high \ninflation and tight labor markets not seen  in decades. M arkets are understandably volatile as they \ngrapple with the many unknowns surrounding the outlook for the economy. Limiting the extent \nto which uncertainty about the pace of interest rate ad justments contributes to this volatility \ncould be important as balance sheet runoff hits its stride . Certainly, relative to the last time \nbalance sheet reduction was initiated in 2017, market conditions are considerably more unsettled. To the extent that the strains in the Treasury market can be attributed in part to heightened \nuncertainty about the path of policy rates, a steady path of rate increases and predictably \nadjusting this path to incoming data could improve market functioning and facilitate balance \nsheet runoff.  \n\n6 \n Successfully shrinking the balance sheet will lessen the Federal Reserve’s footprint in \nfinancial markets.  In particular, the large balance sheet  is distorting the price of duration and \nartificially flattening the yield curve in a way that could promote a reach for yield by investors \nwith potential implications for financial stability.  \nDespite plans announced last May  to significantly reduce the s ize of the balance sheet , \nthe potential exists that there is an asymmetry that allows for relatively easy increases in the \nbalance sheet but makes subsequent decreases more difficult . In a paper  presented at  this year’s \nJackson Hole S ymposium , the authors argue that financial markets can become dependent on the \nincreased liquidity added to the system as the balance sheet expands . 3 After markets have \nadapted  and allocate d the massive increase in liquidity from asset purchases, subsequently \nreducing the balance sheet can be difficult . As a result, l arge reductions in liquidity, especially \nabsent a signal  on longer -run objectives  for the balance sheet , can result in volatility, like  we \nwitnessed in September 2019. One implication  is that a clear  signal to financial markets  that an \nexpanded balance sheet is temporary and not meant to be permanent could dampen volatility and ease the drawdown in liquidity in the longer run.   \nThis is an important argument as the Federal Reserve consider s the ultimate size of its  \nbalance sheet.  Having committed to operating in an ample reserves regime, what constitutes \n“ample ” can evolve over time  and will be dependent on the decisions of financ ial market \nparticipants . A persistently large balance sheet can lead banks to adjust their business models \naround a high level of central  bank liquidity , which then raise s the amount of reserves required to \nmaintain the  ample  regime .  \nAvoiding this threat  will require clear signaling of resolve to shrink the balance sheet and \nremove liquidity.  Given a clear signal, markets are less likely to become “liquidity dependent” \nand adjust their behavior in anticipation of declining reserve balances.  There ma y be benefits to \nannouncing the desired reserve levels as the balance sheet shrinks, giving banks time to prepare \nto operate with significantly fewer reserves.  \n \n \n3 Acha rya, Chauhan, Rajan, a nd Steffen (2022) . “Liquidity Dependence: Why Shrinking Central Ba nk Balance \nSheets is a n Uphill Ta sk .”"

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 4, 2022 \nKansas Bankers Association Annual Conference \nColorado Springs, Colo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n   \n1 \n Thank you for inviting me to join you for this year’s conference. Doug Wareham and his \nteam are key partners with the Kansas City Fed as we deliver on the Federal Reserve’s core \nmissions for monetary policy, supervision and regulation, and payment services.   \n The role of the banking industry in the U.S. economy has been central to my work  at the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  for more than 40 years.  From my first assignment as an \nexaminer  in 1982 to my current position as the Bank’s president and CEO and member of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, I have witnessed dramatic changes to the financial system  and \nthe broader economic landscape. And despite this tremendous change, it remains as true today as \nit did in 1982 that access to credit and other reliable financial services is e ssential to the success \nof local communities , households  and small businesses.   \nWith that overarching theme, my remarks today will focus on some  key developments \nthat I view as shaping the current and future community bank landscape. For example,  my own \nFederal Reserve district , which  covers the heart of the Midwest , parts of the Rocky Mountains , \nand the Southwest , has o ver the last few decades , gradually urbanized  as people moved  from \nsmall towns to  larger, more  urban centers , a trend that parallels  much of the rest of the country.1 \nThis population shift occurred as the District’s  economy became less concentrated  in energy and \nagriculture, and moved towards  service sectors and away from  manufacturing .2  \nIn the face of these changes, community banks have remain ed a vital source of banking \nservices for consumers and small business es, including being a key  provider  of reliable capital . \n \n1 Rappaport, Jordan, “ The Faster Growth o f Larger, Les s Crowded Locations ”, Economic Review , Federal Res erve \nBank of Kansas Cit y, 2018, Fourth Quarter.  \n2 See for example, Wilkerson, Chad R. and Megan D. Williams, “ The Tenth District’s Defining Industries: How Are \nThey Changing ”, Economic Review , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Third Quarter 2007, 59 -81.; Wilkerson, \nChad and Megan Williams, “ The Transformation of Manufacturing Across Federal Reserve Districts: Success for the \nGreat Plains? ”, Economic Review , Second Quarter, 2012, 111 -139.;  Felix, Alison, “ The Growing Importance of the \nServices Sector ”, Rocky Mountain Economist , March 29, 2019.  \n\n   \n2 \n When I talk to business leaders from the region, I often hear stories of how community banks \nhelp suppor t local entrepreneurs and small business owners .3 I also hear stories of the challenges \ncommunities face when locally  based banks disappear.  One business owner in our region noted \nthat after her community’s locally owned banks were acquired, she turned to lines of credit from \none of the nation’s largest banks with favorable terms.  In the midst  of a product expansion, \nhowever, the national economy turned down and the line of credit w as quickly withdrawn.  The \nexperience stood in sharp contrast to the reliable access to credit and long -term relationships with \na community bank that her  business had enjoyed across previous business cycles.  \n \nA Forty -Year Perspective on Community Banking  \nBy far, the most significant change to the community banking landscape over the past \nfour decades  has been the declin ing number of banks and increas ed concentration in the banking \nsector.  In 1985, just three years  after I began my career  with the Kansas City Fed , there were \nabout 15,000 community banks in the United States. Today, that number is less than 5,000 .4 \nSimilarly, the number of banks in my seven -state region has declined by more than  70 percent \nover that same period .5 \nMost of th e decline in the number of banks has been  due to mergers and acquisitions .6 \nAlthough community banks still represent the vast majority of bank charters, they now account \nfor only about 13 percent of bank assets  nationally  as the nation’s largest banks have \n \n3 See Skodack, Debra. “ Enduring Relevance: In an Evolving Landscape, Community Banks Remain Vital to \nCustomers and the Economy ”, Ten Magazine , Fall 2021.  \n4 Jacewitz, Stefan, “ The Increasing Brick -and-Mortar Efficiency of Community Banks ”, Economic Review , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Second quarter, 2022, 19 -35. \n5 Source: Call Report s. \n6 Jagtiani, Julapa. \" Understanding the Effects of the Merger Boom on Community Banks .\" Economic Review -Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City  93.2 (2008): 29.  \n\n   \n3 \n significantly expanded their market share of assets and deposits .7 With a relatively rural \ngeography, the Kansas City Fed’s region still features hundreds of c ommunity banks , holding \nmore than  60 percent of total banking assets  and representing 99 percent of  banks .8  \nAs the banking system has consolidated, its role in the financial system also has shifted. \nFor example, b anks have become  a less important source of corporate credit . The share of \nbusiness loans held by banks has declined from nearly 40 percent in 1985 to less than 25 percent \ntoday, as businesses  are now  more reliant on publicly issued debt and loans from non -bank s. The \ndecline in the  number of banks may partly explain their reduced role in business lending , but it is \nnot the whole story. Other factors from outside the financial sector have also contributed to these \ndynamics , including the country’s changing demographics , increasing reliance on technology , \nand landmark regulatory changes .9   \nDemographic shifts over  the last four decades have significantly changed the  composition \nof the  U.S. population.  Since 1980, the number of Americans 65 and older has more than \ndoubled,  and the United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse. The  Hispanic \npopulation has tripled,  and the U.S. population of those of Asian descent has grown five -fold , \nlargely  through immigration.  \nThese demographic shifts have  chang ed the communities that small banks serve . Non -\nmetro counties, where large numbers of community banks operat e, have seen both slower \npopulation growth and an aging customer base. T hese counties  are also more racially and \n \n7 Hanauer, Matt, Brent Lytle, Chris Summers, and Stephanie Ziadeh, “ Community Banks’ Ongoing Role in the U.S. \nEconomy ”, Economic Review , Second Quarter, 2021, 37 -81. \n8 Source: Call Reports.  \n9 Sengupta, Rajdeep, and Jacob Dice. \" Did Local Factors Contribute to the Decline in B ank Branches? \" Economic \nReview -Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  104.3 (2019): 43 -3. \n \n\n   \n4 \n ethnically diverse today than they were decades ago , and community banks have had to adapt \nand adopt new strategies for attracting customers and employees . \n In addition to demographic  changes , technological advance ment s over the last 40 years \nhave been striking. In the financial servic es sector, these advancements have disaggregated many \ntraditional banking services. Product origination, delivery methods, and customer interact ions \nwith financial institutions have all changed dramatically. Banks are also increasingly automating \nprocesses that have historically required human interaction . Although t hese changes have \nexpedite d account management and allowed banks to leverag e more advanced modeling to \nmanage risks, they  may also have contributed to larger banks’ economies of scale. Perhaps most \nsignificantly, internet and mobile banking has allow ed banks to reach customers across the \nglobe, diminishing the necessity of geographic proxim ity. \n Technology has also foster ed competition from the broader financial services sector  with \nnew entrants promising greater speed, convenience, and flexibility in delivering financial \nservices to households and businesses. More recently, lending and paym ents platforms have \nmoved outside of the banking industry altogether . Household names in the technology sector \nsuch as Amazon, Facebook, Square, and PayPal , along with a wave of fintech startups , continue \nto pursue cutting -edge financial services . \nThese technological innovations reflect customers’ changing preferences for value and \nconvenience . In particular, the demand for fast and mobile payments  continues to grow , and \nservices providing these features are being adopted at a very r apid pace . \nAlong with payment innovation s, non -bank lenders , especially fintechs , have made \nsignificant inroads into loan  markets. Business lending by fintechs  has grown very rapidly in \nrecent years . This shift could reflect changes in  customer s’ expectation s or a considered decision \n\n   \n5 \n by banks to avoid certain risky assets.  Nonetheless, th e trend does suggest a move toward \ntransactional lending forms and away from relationship -based lending. If  these trends accelerate, \nlenders that rely heavily on technolog ical solutions  using “big-data” to reach borrowers could \nchallenge community banks’ “soft information” advantage and market share . \n Finally, regulation has been an important factor shaping the evolution of banking. Across \nthe spectrum o f regulatory changes, three aspects of regulation have factored prominently: \ngeographic deregulation, the deregulation of non -banking activities, and regulation in response to \ncrises.  \n Geographic deregulation began slowly in the late 1970s before picking up rapidly in the \n1980s. Ultimately, what started as localized  effort s to remove barriers to entry for ban ks resulted \nin federal l egislation that allow ed banks to operate and branch nationwide.10 As a result, bank \nconsolidation picked up considerably starting in the 1980s , mostly reflected in mergers of \nsmaller banks as intra - and interstate restrictions were relaxed. However, geographic \nderegulation also enabled the largest banks to begin operating nationwide  and to compete \nglobally . As market share of the largest banks increased in key loan markets , many community \nbanks looked to mergers for scale or saw their balance sheets become more concentrated as some \nbusiness lines moved to larger competitors.11  \n Through the 1990s , as banking consolidated, the largest banks also began to engage in \nwhat were traditionally considered non-banking activities, predominately securities dealing and \nunderwriting. While these activities had been prohibited at banks for close to 70 years under the \nGlass-Steagall Act, the Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act of 1999 permitted a wider array of activities at \n \n10 Rice, Tara and Phillip E. Strahan. “ Does Credit Competition Affect Small -Firm F inance? ”, The Journal of Finance , \n65(3), 2010, 861 -889. \n11 Regehr, Kristen, and Rajdeep Sengupta. \" Se ctoral Loan Concentration and B ank Performance (2001 -2014) .\" \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Working Paper  16-13 (2016).  \n\n   \n6 \n bank holding companies . In response, bank holding companies began  engaging in investment \nbanking while  also maintaining access to important safety net advantages, such as  deposit \ninsurance and access  to Federal Reserve services .  \nThe deregulation of bank s’ activities and geographic operation  produced two very \ndifferent commercial banking models . Today,  thousands of small community banks continue to \noperate in traditional business lines. At the same time,  a handful  of large banking organizations \nnow operate at such scale and are so intertwined with the financial system that their failure poses \nsystemic r isks to the global economy. As revealed during the Global Financial Crisis, large banks \nhave enjoyed some benefits from being “too big to fail.”  \nAfter the financial crisis, however, the regulatory environment changed , as it often has  \nfollowing financial and economic crises.  Regulators sought to learn from t he earlier agricultural \nbank and Savings and Loan crises of the 1980s , as well as the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 -\n2009,  and took steps to ensure a safer banking system  after eac h crisis.  The Dodd -Frank Act of \n2010, for example, made important inroads into addressing “too big to fail” advantages —though \nhow successful it was remains to be seen.  \nThe regulatory responses to these crises have generally taken a one -size -fits-all approach. \nRegulations can be blunt instruments, failing  to effectively account for the incentives and risk \nprofile s associated with the relationship lending model of many smaller banks. As a result, \ncommunity banks can bear a disproportionate burden as they implement costly compliance \nprocesses without commensurate benefit s to safety and soundness or fair access to credit .  \n \n \n \n\n   \n7 \n The Importance of Community Banks  \nEven a s new nonbank entrants become embedded in the financial services sector, the \nbanking system continues to hold a unique role in our economy. Banks remain the primary \nfinancial firm s for providing  liquidity when needed, ensur ing payments are readily transferable, \nand facilitating monetary policy  implementation .  \nFor their part, community banks continue to leverage relationship lending, with a focus \non local lending and deposit -taking . Credit decisions are based on qualitative as well as \nquantitative aspects of a borrower’s credit profile . In particular, s maller banks provide a critical \nsource of financing for small businesses.  Despite holding a fraction of the nation’s banking \nassets, community banks underwrite a sizeable 40 percent of lending to small businesses.  The \nstrength of the relationship between community banks and small businesses was highlighted  \nduring the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program. At a time w hen COVID -19 \nlockdowns threatened the viability of many small businesses, community bank s ensured that \npandemic relief funds quickly reached this segment of our economy, ultimately holding  37 \npercent of all outstanding PPP loans  serviced by banks .12  \nBeyond lending to local businesses and households, smaller banks often serve key \nleadership roles in their communities.  These bankers  sit on the boards of local schools, hospitals, \nand other civic organizations , not only meeting the credit needs of their local communities , but \nthey are also an integral part  of the m.  \nGiven th e importance of these attributes to local economies, the implications of an \nevolving financial services landscape for access to credit in rural markets, for small business, and \nfor the overall health of Main Street should be carefully considered.  Both  regulators and banks  \n \n12 Marsh, W. Blake and Padma Sharma, “ PPP Raised Community Bank Revenue but Lowered Profitability ”, \nEconomic Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, December 2020.  \n\n   \n8 \n will be influential in ensur ing these critical financial services can continue to meet the needs of \nthousands of communities, safely and efficiently.  \n \nA Message to Regulators  \n Having been handed thousands and thousands of pages of legislation intended to secure \nthe financial stability of our nation’s financial system, it’s a tall order to ask bank r egulators  to \nminimize  regulatory and supervisory burden while promoting competition and maintaining the \nsafety and soundness of the bank ing sy stem. It is made more difficult when the business models \nof banks vary from small, traditional banks to global systemically important banks . Still, in the \ninterest of meeting the range of business needs served by these institutions, I see opportunities \nfor further calibrating the supervisory framework , taking into account  the business model of \nsmall banks in three key areas: advancing risk-focused appr oaches to supervision , appropriately \ntailoring capital requirements, and providing clear er guidance around innovation and alternative \nbusiness models.  \n Over the past four decades, the volume and complexity of the data collect ed from \ncommunity banks has increased substantially. T his data  has supported both policy development \nand supervision.  Unfortunately , the time spent on the examination of an individual community \nbank has not meaningfully declined  as a result of this data coll ection . In fact, according to the \nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the most recent Community Bank Sentiment Inde x \nshowed  that community banker sentiment toward regulatory burden is at a multi -year low  and \nmore negative than any other component.13 Moreover , a large majority —81 percent of \nrespondents —expect  regulatory burden will be worse  in the future.14   \n \n13 Conference of State Bank Supervisors, “ Community Bank Sentiment Index ”, second quarter of 2022.  \n14 Ibid.  \n\n   \n9 \n Under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act ( EGRPRA ), \nregulations can be questioned for their continued effectiveness and burden. This provides an \navenue to reshape the  supervisory framework in way that preserves its focus on safety and \nsoundnes s and fair access to credit while recognizing today’s banking landscape requires a far \nmore tailored approach . \n Among these regulations, capital requirements play a particularly important role in the \nstability of our financial system. Here, too, ensuring t hat these requirements are capturing the full \nrange of risks and avoiding unintended advantages w ill be necessary.  The financial crisis of \n2007-2008,  as well as the market upheavals of March 2020 , demonstrated that extreme events \ncan and do happen. Most importantly, bank failures, particularly large bank failures, are costly. Capital requirements should reflect these heavy soc ial costs.  \nCurrently, the nation’s largest banks hold less capital than community banks. While small \nbanks in the United States hold a T ier 1 leverage ratio of nearly 10 percent, global systemically \nimportant banks  hold just under 7 percent .\n15 Imbalanced  capital requirements , combined with \nperceived market advantages,  can result in disproportionate gain s for large banks and their \nshareholders. As a result, large banks may capture market share, thereby encourag ing community \nbanks to  consolidat e to compete. More work is needed in my view to tailor capital requirements \nacross bank size and business model s. \nFinally, as the financ ial services landscape continues to  evolv e, regulators play an \nimportant role in providing clear expectations and timely  guidance to regulated entities.  The \nability of smaller  banks to compete and innovate as they respond to market dynamics and \n \n15 Pellerin, Sabrina, “ Bank Capital Analysis Semiannual Update ,” Bank Capital Analysis , Federal Res erve Bank of \nKansas City, May  2022. \n\n   \n10 \n customer preferences  will depend on such guidance , especially to evaluate investments in \ntechnology and various fintech and vendor partnerships .  \n \nA Message to Bankers  \nA more -tailored approach to regulat ion does not of course solve for every challenge \nconfronting community banks, as bankers well understand.  The strategies these banks pursue \nhave long been the key determinant of their success and survival in meeting their c ommunities ’ \nneeds.  Those strategies increasingly hinge on adopting new technology to meet the demands of a \nmobile and connected customer base and to attract talent. By doing so, bankers can lower costs, \nreach new customer segments —including  underbanked populations —and  drive new business \ngrowth.  \nInvestments in technology can help banks meet their customers’ changing needs, gain \noperational efficiencies, improve access to an evolving payments system, and better connect \nlocal customers to the b roader economy.  Adoption of instant payments settlement services , for \nexample, offers the ability to provide new services that meet customer preferences for speed . \nAlongside private sector services, the Federal Reserve ’s implementation next year of a new r etail \npayment rail known as FedNow will allow banks of all sizes to meet household and business \ndemand for real -time payments.   \nDeploying contemporary technology also can help to attract and retain a work force with \ndiverse skillsets. Th is talent can, in turn, help banks identify what is needed to compete in a \nconnected, fast -pace d world , and importantly, provide critical leadership succession .  \n \n \n\n   \n11 \n Conclusion \nThe economic vitality of thousands of communities and rural geographies  depend s on \nreliable access to credit and other financial services. Over the past 40 years, much has changed in \nthe delivery of those services, driven by demographics, technolog ical innovation,  and regulation. \nOver this tim e, community banks have continued to play an instrumental role in meet ing the \nneeds of rural places and their communities. W ith the right mix of strategy and innovation, and a \nwell-calibrated regulatory approach, the community bank model can continue to be a trusted \ncornerstone of the U.S. financial system  for thousands of households and small businesses who \nlook to them for essential credit needs and services."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 11, 2022 \nMid-America Labor/Management Conference \nLake Ozark, Mo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thanks  for the invitation to join you this morning  to offer my perspective on the \necon omy and monetary policy . I expect it will come as no surprise to you that my remarks will \nfocus on inflation.   \nFor decades, inflation has been an afterthought for most Americans . Individual prices of \ngoods and services moved up and down, but overall inflation remained relatively stable. Over the \nperiod from 1991 to 2020, inflation , on average, ran  near 2 percent, the Federal Reserve’s  \nlonger -run target.   \nToday, inflation  has climbe d to 8.6 percent, the fastest pace in 40 years.1 For many \nyounger Americans, high inflation is a novel experience, while for others , the situation  may seem \nuncomfortably reminiscent of the 1970s.  Regardless, inflation is a source of considerable pain \nfor households and businesses , and a central economic challenge for policymakers.   \n  Congress has tasked the Fed eral Reserve with objectives for full employment and stable \nprices, often referred to as the Fed’s dual mandate.  To achieve those objectives, t he Fed must act \ndecisively to bring inflation down and reestablish price stability.  While the goal  is clear,  the path \nto achieving that goal is a very challenging one.  I’ll talk about som e of the considerations that are \nlikely to influence the path ahead.     \n \nA Tight Economy  \nStrong demand for goods and services has been outpacing lagging supply for some time , \nresulting in a tight economy with prices rising as a consequence . To be sure, there have been a \nnumber of specific shocks, particularly to food and energy prices, that have contributed to the increase in inflation.  Disruptions to the global market for crude oil arising from  the war in \n \n1 This figure refers to the year -over-year percent change in the consumer price index (CPI) as of May 2022.  \n\n2 \n Ukraine, along with a reduction in g lobal refining capacity after  the pandemic, have contributed \nto an almost 50 percent increase in the price of gasoline since the beginning of the year.  \nMeanwhile, the  war in Ukraine and  poor growing conditions, including in the western portion of \nthe Kansas City Fed’s region , have pushed up global food prices.   \nHowever, as you know, t oday’s high inflation story goes well beyond food and energy \nprices . Nearly every categor y tracked in the Fed’s preferred price index for goods and services \nhas recorded increases in recent months, a proportion not seen since the early 1980s.   \nWhen prices first started to move up in the spring of last year, the increases were most \nnotable among goods . Pandemic spending patterns favored the purchase of home upgrades , \nincluding gym equipment and household appliances,  over services such as restaurant meals and \nair travel.  More recently, services prices have shown stronger growth, with airfares spiking and \nrents and housing costs also increasing robustly.  \nThe broad-based nature of inflation suggests that a tight economy is driving  price \npressures rather than individual supply disruptions and shocks.  Two main factors  appear to be \ncontributing to this tightness . First, as the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand for goods \nand services surged, supported by a tremendous amount of fiscal and monetary policy  support . \nThe federal government has provided about $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus since the start of the \npandemic.  Monetary policy was also very accommodative, as the Federal Reserve cut interest \nrates to zero and added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet.  \nA second factor that seems increasingly apparent is long -lasting damage to the supply \nside of the economy  as a result of the pandemic.  Even as inflation suggests  that the economy is \noperating far above capacity, the level of real GDP remains 2  ½ percent below its pre -pandemic \ntrend , a sizable gap equal to almost a full year’s worth of growth.  One explanation for this \n\n3 \n dynamic is that that the pandemic has affected the long -run productive capacity of the economy \nby more than anticipated.  The pandemic recession was different from most recessions in that the \nservices sector was hit particularly har d. Productive capacity in services appears to have been \neliminated quickly during the pandemic, and it has been slow to come back even as demand has \nreturned, pushing up prices . \n A Tight Labor Market   \n Another factor holding back supply has been the continuing  effect  of the pandemic on the \nlabor market.  Workers have never experienced a disruption quite like the economic shut down \nthat occurred in  March 2020.  Within a matter of weeks , 20 million workers lost their jobs and the \nunemployment rate s kyrocketed from historic low s to a post -Depression  high.   \n Now, two years later, although the unemployment rate is near  its pre -pandemic level  of \n3½ percent , much has changed . For example,  the labor market appears to be much tighter now \nthan it was pre -pandemic.  One way to see this is through the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market \nConditions Indicators ( LMC I), which take into account a broad er range of labor market measures  \nthan the unemploymen t rate alone.  These indicators  suggest that the labor market is considerably \nstronger and tighter than it was before the pandemic .\n2 Both constrained labor supply and \nexceptionally strong labor demand are shaping this outcome.  \n The labor force participation rate is still more than 1 percentage point below its pre-\npandemic level , primarily on account of lower participation among older workers, as most other \n \n2 The three -month moving a verage of the LMCI -implied unemployment ra te currently stands a t 3.29 percent. T here \nhas never been a lower reading for thi s measure  since the LMCI began in 1992. For details on the LMCI -implied \nunemployment rate, see Glover, Andy ; Jose Mustre -del-Rio; and Emily Polla rd . 2021.  “KC Fed LMCI Implies the \nLabor Market is Closer to a Full Recovery than the Unemployment Rate Alone Suggests .”  Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, Economic Bulletin , October 19.  \n\n4 \n demographic groups have largely returned to pre -pandemic norms . Some of this decline could be \nrelated to early retirement, or perhaps just more persistent retirement, as workers who have left \nthe workforce now appear less likely to return.    \n  On the other side , labor demand is historically strong.  Currently, there are about two job \nopenings per unemployed worker , the largest gap  in over 20 year s, and I hear regularly from my \ncontacts on the difficulty of keeping positions filled.   \n  Some  observers have noted that many  of these job openings may be irrelevant in \nmeasuring the tightness of the labor market since some companies appear to be testing  the \nmarket  rather than actively recruiting employees . If this is true, vacancies could decline  to more \nnormal levels without a rise in  unemployment .  \n  While low recruiting intensity may be part of the story shaping today’s labor market, I am \nnot convinced it is the  only one.  Sectors with a high number of reported vacancies, such as \neducation and health, are also reporting very solid employment growth, suggesting robust hiring. \nAt the same time, employment in these sectors is still below pre -pandemic levels, implying that \nmany positions remain to be filled.   \n  Professional and business services is another sector with a very high number of  job \nopenings  and a very solid pace of employment growth.  Interestingly, job gains  in this sector h ave \nrecently been fueled by growth in temporary help services , perhaps suggesting that employers  \nare finding it difficult to hire in a tight labor market and are substituting toward temp s. Another \npossibility is that businesses are  increasingly  turning to temp workers because they anticipate  \nthat the surge in  demand that they are experiencing will be short -lived.  \n  These different interpretations of the data underscore the high degree of  uncertainty \nregarding w here the labor market will ultimately settle.  On the one hand, if labor demand eases \n\n5 \n and job openings fall , we should expect at least some rise in the unemployment rate. On the other \nhand, labor supply could increase as pandemic  effects wane and the participation rate of older \nworke rs rises. All else equal, with more labor supply, the tightness of the labor market could ease \nwithout a substantial fall in labor demand .  \n \nMonetary Policy Considerations  \nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy cannot , of course , reverse the supply shocks that \nhave boosted inflation.  It can, however , moderate the pace of demand growth to narrow \nimbalances in the economy and reduce price pressures.  By doing so, its actions can also prevent \nhigh inflation from becoming embedded in price - and wage-setting behavior . For many  workers , \nrecent wage increases  have not kept pace with price in flation . Declining real , or inflation -\nadjusted , wages are not sustainable and could lead workers and businesses to build high inflation \ninto wage contracts , to the  long-term  detriment of the labor market.  Instead , experience has \nshown that low and stable  inflation  is most conducive to maintaining a strong labor market that \nbenefit s households , workers,  and businesses. To promote sustainable growth, m onetary policy \nmust therefore take decisive steps to  tighten financial conditions and bring inflation down.  \nSince March, t he policy rate has increased by 150 basis points , and the process of \nshrinking the Fed’s large balance sheet began last month.  In response to these actions, and with \nexpectations of further rate hikes, broader financial conditions have tightened, with sharp \nincreases across a spectrum of interest rates.  With the policy rate still relatively low  and a $9 \ntrillion dollar balance sheet in the early stages of shrinking , the case for continuing to remov e \npolicy accommodation is clear -cut. The speed at which interest rates should rise , however,  is an \nopen question.   \n\n6 \n I’m certainly sympathetic to th e view that interest rates need to increase rapidly, \nrecognizing that current rates are out of sync with today’s economic landscape.  However, I am \nalso mindful of how the rate of change in tightening policy can affect  households, businesses, \nand financial markets  particularly during a time of heightened uncertainty . Policy changes \ntransmit to  the economy with a lag, and significant and abrupt changes can be unsettling to \nhouseholds and small businesses a s they make necessary adjustments. It also has implications for \nthe yield curve and traditional bank lending models, such as those prevalent among community \nbanks.  For these reasons, several considerations influence my own thinking about  the appropriate \npath for policy.  \nFirst, communicati ng the path for interest rates is likely far more consequential than the \nspeed with which we get there.  Moving interest  rates  too fast raises the prospect of oversteering.  \nIt is notable that even before the March increase in the target range for the federal funds rate, \nTreasury yields had already moved up significantly and financial conditions were tightening , as \nexpectations were building for significant adjustments in mone tary policy.  And indeed, the \nadjustment has been significant.  This is already a historically swift pace of rate increases for \nhouseholds and businesses to adapt to,  and more abrupt changes in interest rates could create \nstrains, either in the economy or fi nancial markets, that would undermine the  Fed’s  ability to \ndeliver on the higher path of rates c ommunicated.  Along these lines,  I find it remarkable  that just \nfour months after beginning to raise rates , there is growing discussion of recession risk,  and \nsome forecasts are  predicting  interest rate cuts as soon as next year.  Such projections suggest to \nme that a rapid pace of rate increases brings about the risk of tightening policy more quickly than \nthe e conomy and markets can adjust.  \n\n7 \n Second, in addition to the oft -cited long and variable lags, the transmission of higher \npolicy rates and the associated tightening in financial conditions to spending, employment, and \ninflation is subject to considerable uncertainty.  For example, the shift in spending  away from \nservices to housing and durable goods during the pandemic may make the economy more \nsensitive to higher interest rates.  Another possibility is that the significant accumulation of liquid \nsavings during the pandemic will dampen the effects of higher interest rates on spending and ultimately inflation.  Given this range of outcomes, it is unclear just how high rates will need to \nmove in order to bring inflation down.  These dynamics suggest it will be particularly important \nto observe how the economy is adapting to changes in monetary policy.  \nFinally , the pace of increases in  the federal funds rate could have implications for balance \nsheet runoff.  The economy is in unfamiliar territory , with a combination of high inflation and \ntight labor markets not witnessed in decades.  Therefore, markets are understandably volatile as \nthey grapple with the many unknowns surrounding the outlook for the economy and the path of \npolicy.  Limiting the exten t to which uncertainty about the pace of interest rate adjustments \ncontributes to this volatility could be important especially as balance sheet runoff  gets underway . \nCertainly, relative to the last time balance sheet reduction was initiated in 2017, marke t \nconditions are considerably more unsettled.  To the extent that the current strains in the Treasury \nmarket can be attributed in part to heightened uncertainty about the path of policy rates , a steady \npath of rate increases, and predictably adjusting this path to incoming data, could improve \nmarket functioning and facilitate balance sheet runoff , especially as the pace of runoff \naccelerates later this year.\n3 \n \n3 See Sengupta, Rajdeep,  a nd A. Lee Smith . 2022.  “Assessing Market Conditions ahead of Quantitative Tightening .” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,  Economic Bulletin , forthcoming.  \n\n8 \n Making significant progress in reducing the balance sheet over the coming years  will be \nimportant in my view . After amassing more than $4.5 trillion in assets since early 2020, the \nFederal Reserve’s outsized presence in financial markets can distort the price of  duration and \nartificially flatten s the yield curve.  Unwinding the balance sheet should  reduce this distortion and \nhas the potential to steepen the yield curve, depending on the pace of increases in the funds rate.  \nRaising short -term rates much faster than  longer -term rates could further invert the yield curve \nand challenge traditional bank  lending models  as a consequence.  To the extent an inverted yield \ncurve has historically preceded recessions in the United States, such a scenario could pose yet \nanother challenge to achieving a significant reduction in the balance sheet.   \n Conclusion \nThe Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its mandate for price stability , and I \nsupport ongoing rate increases accompanied by a significant reduction in the size of the balance \nsheet to bring inflation down and make progress towards longer -run price stability.\n The pace at \nwhich this path unfolds will need to be carefully balan ced against the state of the economy and \nfinancial markets, particularly during a time of heightened uncertainty , to effectively achieve this \nobjective ."

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nMay 23, 2022 \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Agricultural Symposium  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n  Good evening. We’re pleased to host this year’s symposium to talk about a sector of the \neconomy that is particularly important to the region we serve. I very much appreciate your \nparticipation and look forward to our discussion.  \n This year ’s topic takes a close look at labor market dynamics in the agricultural sector. \nAs the title “Help Wanted in Agriculture”  suggests , the availability of workers  is a central \nconcern  among producers . This is true not only in agriculture but across the wider economy . In \nmy remarks this evening, I’ll talk about these labor market challenges in the context of broader \neconomic conditions and will offer an outlook for the economy and for monetary policy.  \n I should acknowledge at the outset that a  centerpiece of any observations about the \neconomy is high inflation. After decades of low and stable prices in the U nited States , inflation \nhas emerged as a central challenge in the economy. P rices are moving up, and more rapidly than \nat any point in the recent past.  Over the year  ending in April, the consumer price index (CPI)  \nrose 8.3 percent, near the fastest pace in 40 years.  Steep increases in energy and food prices  are \nreflected in this number , partly attributable to disrupted commodity markets following Russia’s \ninvasion of Ukraine . But  that is not the full story.  Excluding food and energy, prices increased  \n6.2 percent over the last year , also near a 40-year high.  \n When inflation first started to pick up in early  2021, a few standout categories of goods \nseemed to be driving the increase.  Prices for c ars (new, used, and rented) played a \ndisproportionate role in boosting  the overall inflation rate, even as many other categories of \nconsumption showed little price pressure.  In fact , inflation at th at time was historically  dispersed.  \nIn the first quarter of 2021, categories of  goods and services accounting for about 20 percent of \nspending recorded inflation rates significantly higher than  their previous  trend s. An even greater \nshare, about 25 percent, w ere showi ng rates of inflation significantly below trend.  However, by \nthe end of 2021, price pressures had broadened significantly, with almost 50 percent of expenditures recording inflation significantly above previous trends , while the proportion of \ngoods and ser vices with exceptionally weak inflation had collapsed  to zero.   \n  The inflation we are now experiencing is obviously both too high and too broad  to \ndismiss. It has become a top priority for the Federal Reserve to return inflation to its 2 percent \nobjective.   \n  \n\n2 \n How did we get here?  \n The factors behind the recent increase in prices  are fairly straightforward: W hen demand \nfor goods and services exceeds the economy’s ability to supply those goods and services, prices \nrise. The nature of this demand and supply imbalance , however , poses some challenging issues \nfor policymakers . \n As the economy reopened throughout 202 1, demand surged, suppor ted by a tremendous \namount of policy stimulus.  The federal government has provided about $6 trillion of fiscal \nstimulus since the start of the pandemic . Monetary policy was also very accommodative, as t he \nFederal Reserve cut interest rates to zero and added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet.  \nTogether , fiscal and monetary policy  provided a massive boost  to the economy , encourag ing \nconsumers to spend.   \n And spend they did, particularly on goods.  Additional time at home during the pandemic \napparently allowed households to identify needs they might not have previously known they had , \nand demand for kitchen appliances, entertainment systems,  and exercise equipment skyrocketed.  \nAlthough purchases of durable goods have eased after jumping in the first half of last year, they \nremain about  10 percent above pre -pandemic trends.  \n The fast recovery of the labor market has also encouraged spending.  The economy added \na record number of jobs in 2021.  In the first four months of this year, a further 2 million jobs \nwere added, about equal to the total number of jobs created in each full year  of the 2010s.  More \npeople working increases income s and supports higher spending.  \nWith  the amount of stimulus injected into the economy, the strength of demand  is not \nparticularly surprisin g. Although the surge in consumption was certainly not a given recalling \nhow uncertain the course of the pandemic remained throughout 2021.  What is more  surprising , \nfrom my perspective, is the underperformance of the supply side of the economy.  Even a s \ninflation suggests that the economy is operating far above capacity, practically bursting at the \nseams, the level of real GDP remains 2½ percent below its p re-pandemic trend, a shortfall equal \nto a typical year’s worth of growth.   The emergence of supply constraints  has put the economy in somewhat unfamiliar \nterritory.  In the two decades prior to the pandemic, it was widely thought that the primary factor \nholding back economic growth was weak demand.  Underlying this belie f was the relative benign \nnature of inflation over this period , even in the face of historically low global interest rates  and \n\n3 \n low unemployment . An apparently low neutral rate of int erest, a level known to economists as  r-\nstar, suggested that  monetary policy had to work pretty hard just to keep demand in the vicinity \nof the economy’s available supply.   \n Now supply constraints  dominate the economic narrative . What changed? One possibil ity \nis that nothing has changed.  Perhaps the pre-pandemic economy was closer to full capacity than \nwe realized.  However, another possibility is that the pandemic has resulted in persistent, perhaps \neven permanent, damage to the productive capacity of the e conomy.  This damage could be \nmanifested along a number of dimensions . I’ll highlight three : persistent damage to global supply \nchains , the quick destruction of capacity in the services sector , and long -lasting damage to \nworkforce engagement and labor force participation.  \n \nPersistent disruptions to supply chains  \nThe initial shock of the global shutdown in March  2020 tangled the carefully coordinated \nmovement of shipping containers, the lifeblood of global commerce, and disrupted global \nproduction networ ks. Although progress has been made and the line of ships waiting off the \nshore of Long Beach has diminished, disruptions have migrated to other parts of the supply \nchain.  For example, warehouse space has become scarce in many  markets.  \nProduction and capac ity have also been affected.  The semiconductor shortage and its \nimpact on the automobile sector are well known, but other industries have also been hit by shutdowns . For example, in 2020,  following a  sharp fall -off in demand for diesel and gasoline, a \nnumber of refineries in the United States permanently shut down,  lowering domestic refining \ncapacity by 5 percent.  This loss of capacity has contributed to the run up in fuel prices this year \nas remainin g capacity is running flat out .  \nMore broadly,  the war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply and transportation of many \ncommodities, pushing up prices for energy and food across the world.  The international price of \ncrude oil has increased 40 percent since t he beginning of the year, as sanctions threaten the flow \nof oil from Russia, the world’s third largest producer and a major  exporter.  Likewise, the price of \nnatural gas , another key Russian export, ha s climbed around the world, putting upward pressure \non prices for the whole constellation of goods and services for which natural gas is a key input , \nfrom electricity to fertilizer . \n\n4 \n Similar to energy markets, the prices of many agricultural commodities also surged with \nthe war in Ukraine and have remained very high. The price of wheat, for example, is about \ndouble what it was a year ago, but the prices of other major commodities are also considerably \nhigher than last year and much higher than before the pandemic. While the increase in prices has \nsupported income s in the farm sector, I have heard many contacts in our region describe their \nangst about rising input costs, or potentially even the availability of some key inputs, such as \nfertilizer. Alongside strong incomes, the price of farmland in many parts of the country has also \nset new records, which may be positive for those who own land, but has begun to raise costs \nsubstantially for those who rent from one year to the next.  \nAcross the spectrum of these supply constraints is growing concern about the persistenc e \nof these issues. As the efficiency of just -in-time production and global networks gives way to the \naccumulation of unproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency  over efficiency , the \ndamage could prove permanent . These effects are compounded by a war that has had a dramatic \nimpact on global commodity markets  and offers few signs of near-term  resolution.    \n \nThe quick destruction of capacity  in the service sector \n A second factor pointing to supply-side damage can be found in the service sector of the \neconomy. Transportation and production bottlenecks have been particularly important for \nexplaining the upward movement in goods prices, but recently  services pri ces have also been \npicking up.  The 12-month change in services prices  (excluding energy)  reached 4.9 percent in \nApril, the fastest pace in over 30 years.  In April alone, services prices increased 0.7 percent, also \na 30-year high.  This jump is particularly notable because service  price inflation  is normally \nstable month-to -month . Over the past three decades, for example, 70 percent of the time the \nmonthly changes in services prices have  hovered between 0.2 or 0.3 percent.   \nThe increase in services price inflation is occurring despite continued weakness in the \nsector.  Consumption of services only returned to pre -pandemic levels in the first quarter of this \nyear, and , if we were to extend the pre-pandemic trend growth rate, services consumption is 4 \npercent below where it might have been . Given apparent slack in the services sector , why are \nprices moving up so strongly?  It could be that  excess capacity in the services sector  disappeared \nmuch more quickly than we might have anticipated, so that even with subpar output the sector is \n\n5 \n not actually operating with much slack.  Lack of labor supply is clearly part of the story (and one \nI’ll discuss later) but this sector saw capacity  destruction  early on.   \nThe pandemic recession was different from most  recession s in that demand for services \nwas hit particularly hard while demand for goods skyrocketed.  Typical ly, the consumption of \ngoods fall s more steeply than services  with downward pressure on prices as slack  opens up in the \neconomy.  What we may be  seeing in the current services -led recession is a much quicker \nadjustment of available capacity than in a typical recession.  Lower fixed costs in the services \nindustry may have allowed firms to quickly eliminate excess capacity in reaction to a steep fall in \ndemand.  \nTo provide a concrete example , let’s look at the market for haircuts.  The real \nconsumption of haircuts ha s decreased  by over one -third  relative to pre -pandemic levels, a \ndecline likely initially attributable to social distancing and then later to the relaxed grooming \nstandards associated with work ing from home.  \nGiven a traditional understanding of the economy , with fixed costs to adjusting capacity, \nthis sharp falloff in demand for haircuts  should have resulted in a tremendous amount of slack in \nthe hairdressing industry and downward pressure on prices.  However, the price of haircuts has \nnot declined, but rather recorded some of the large st increases  in decades.  Post-pandemic, haircut \ninflation has been running at about a 5 percent pace, the fastest pace in 40 years and about twice \nthe pre -pandemic average.  \nWhy would prices rise with this sharp drop in demand? I t appears that the industry \nreacted quickly to the fall in  demand and cut capacity.  Employment in the industry is down  15 \npercent from pre -pandemic levels and has shown little movement in recent months.  Interestingly, \nthere has been a large increase in the number of establishments, both barber shops and beauty \nsalons, but only locations with less than 5 employees.  The number of l arger e stablishments with \nmore than 5 employees ha s fallen off sharply.   \nA similar, more publicized, dynamic has played out in the air travel industry.  After \nplunging in the initial months of the pandemic, air travel has bounced back but remains almost \n10 percent below pre -pandemic levels.  However, airfares have increased robustly over the past \nyear and are now close to 15 percent higher than their pre -pandemic level.  The industry quickly \ncut capacity  after air travel plummeted in the spring of 2020 and increasing capacity with the \nrevival of demand has been difficult.  \n\n6 \n  \nContinuing labor market frictions  \nThe inability of the service sector to quickly add capacity is intrinsically related to the \nthird factor holding back the supply side of the economy : continued frictions in the labor market.  \nBy many metrics , the labor market appears to be unusually tight . The unemployment rate, at 3.6 \npercent, is close to a historic low.  The number of posted job vacancies is the highest on record, \nas is the pace at whi ch workers are quitting their jobs , an indicator of a hot labor market as \nworkers are more likely to quit when alternative opportunities are abundant . Speaking to contacts  \nin the region , hiring and retaining workers is a n acute challenge.  Yet, notwithstanding the \napparent tightness  of the labor market, employment remains over 1 million workers short of pre -\npandemic levels and considerably further below the pre -pandemic trend.  What explains this gap?  \nI will highlight two dynamics weighing on the labor force : lagging labor force participation and a \nsignificant step down in the pace of immigration.   \nIn April, the percentage of the working age population participating in the labor force  \nwas 1.2 percentage points lower than before the pandemic.  Cont rolling for population growth \nand aging, this implies a gap of about 2 million workers relative to pre -pandemic levels.1 Earlier  \nin the recovery , prime  age women made up a disproportionate number of the missing workers, \npossibly due to disruptions to chil dcare arrangements.  More recently, prime age participation has \nrebounded to close to pre -pandemic levels, such that the largest contributors  to the current gap in \nparticipation are workers older than 65.  Participation for the 65-plus  age group fell off sharply \nwith the pandemic and has not shown much recovery, perhaps as fears of illness lessened the desire to work and this was a feasible option as rising asset values boosted retirement  wealth.  \nAnother factor contributing to the tight labor market has  likely been a significant fall off \nin the number of  immigrants.  This issue is often highlighted by our regional contacts in the \nagricultural sector and other parts of the economy. Immigration started to move down in 2016 and then fell off  sharply during the pandemic.  If immigration ha d continued at its earlier  trend \nfor the previous  five years , estimates suggest there would be an additional 3 million  immigrants, \nmany of whom would have joined the workforce .\n2 \n \n1 See Tuzemen , “How Many Workers are Truly ‘Missing’ from the Labor Force? ” Economic Bulletin, May 6, 2022.  \n2 See Cohen and Shampine , “Immigration Shortfall May be a Headwind for Labor Supply ” Economic Bulletin , May \n11, 2022 .  \n\n7 \n  \nWhere do we go from here?  \nWith these thorny supply side issues affecting the economy, what role does monetary \npolicy play?  Certainly, monetary policy cannot fix  supply shocks.  But monetary policy does play \nan important role in addressing the imbalances between supply and demand. With inflation high, \nmonetary policy must act  to dampen the pace of demand growth, bringing demand into \nalignment with supply and relieving pressure on prices.   \nOn the supply side, for example, faster increases in production, perhaps as supply chains \ncontinue to untangle or as a greater number of workers return to  the labor force, c ould relieve \npressure on prices as m onetary policy tighten s. Conversely, e ven further disruptions to \nproduction, from continued lockdowns in China or further fallout from the Ukraine war, could \nadd to inflation pressures and require a stronger monetary policy response.   \nOn the demand side, if, as appears increasing ly likely, the  war proves a major drag on \nglobal growth, or if Covid lockdowns  substantially dent growth  in China, then lower demand \nmight take some of the heat out of inflation.  However, an important wildcard in the outlook for \ndemand is the trillions of dollars of excess savi ngs sitting in household bank  accounts.  These \nsavings represented a reassuring buffer  early on . Now with demand hot and persistent supply \nconstraints , an abundance of liquid checking deposits could potentially make the Federal \nReserve ’s job of c ooling demand more challenging.   \n  \nConsiderations for the path of policy  \n With inflation at a 40 -year high and the unemployment rate near record lows , the stance \nof monetary policy has belatedly shifted  to the removal of accommodation . A series of interest \nrate increases combined with significant reductions in asset holdings are underway. However, with real inflation -adjusted interest rates still deeply negative and the balance sheet twice its pre-\npandemic size, questions about the path of policy are prevalent.  I will provide some context on \nhow I am thinking about these questions.  \n The responsiveness of the economy to changes in the interest rate can be difficult to \npredict in part because it is likely to vary over time . For example, with consumption skewed \ntowards durable goods, which tend to be more interest -sensitive than other components of \nspending, it is possible that higher rates will have a more pronounced impac t on demand and \n\n8 \n inflation than observed in the past. On the other hand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and \nhealthy household balance sheets might make consumption less reactive  to higher interest rates.  \n Fed policymakers have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to r estore price \nstability, and I expect that further rate increases could put the federal funds rate in the \nneighborhood of 2 percent by August, a significant pace of change in policy  settings . Balance \nsheet reduction plans will also be underway as a tighteni ng mechanism, with financial markets \nfar more unsettled currently than in 2017, when the Fed last initiated a rundown in the size of its  \nbalance sheet.  Communicating about our policy path to avoid introducing any further uncertainty \ncan ensure progress in significantly reducing the size of the  balance sheet and lessening the \ncentral bank’s footprint in financial markets.  Evidence that inflation is clearly decelerating will \ninform judgments about further tightening.  \n  The central bank’s job is to prevent persistent imbalances from feeding into inflation and \nunmooring inflation expectations. By influencing interest rates, the Federal Reserve primarily \naffects the demand side of the imbalance. The evolution of its efforts alongside other factors wil l \naffect the course of monetary policy, requiring continuous and careful monitoring."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 30, 2022 \nThe Economic Club of New York \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n My thanks to the Economic Club of New York for the invitation to speak.  I look forward \nto today’s conversation.   \nThe economy is emerg ing from the shadow of the pandemic . Public health r estrictions are \nbeing lifted, workers are commuting again , and things are beginning to return to normal, even if \nthere is a good chance that “normal ” isn’t quite  the same normal that we left behind.  Over the \npast two years, there was an unprecedented use of the word “unprecedented”  to describe the \neconomy.  And understandably so.  We had a record decline in jobs, then a record rebound.  A \nhistoric drop in output foll owed by a historic gain.  All supported by a previously unimagined \nlevel of  fiscal and monetary policy support.  That it was an “unprecedented” time in the  nation’s \neconomy is no exaggeration . \nNow as many of us return to our offices after a two-year hiatus  and dust off our desks, the \neconomy faces yet another challenge:  high inflation.  Instead of calling it unprecedented , \nhowever, I often hear people suggest that the current economy has an uncomfortable \nresemblance to that of the 1970s  with inflation now running at a pace not seen since that era.  \nWithout elaborating on what I view as important differences between now and the 1970s, the \nfocus on high inflation is undebatable . \nFor policymakers, understanding the nature of today’s inflation dynamics is essential.  \nHow will the extraordinary shock of the pandemic play out relative to the dynamics that have \nshaped economies over time, and what lessons can be drawn from past inflationary periods?  \nBoth aspects are relevant in my view to how the economy is likely to evolve, particularly as it \nrelates to inflation.   \n In my remarks  this afternoon , I will offer my views on the factors I see shaping the \noutlook for economic activity and inflation, and how those factors inform my thinking about the appropriate path for monetary policy.    \n \nThe Outlook for Demand, Supply , and Inflation \nConsumers continue to spend , and the underlying fundamental s for consumption are \npositive . Retail sales adjusted for inflation increased 9 percent over the 12 months ending in \nFebruary, far above the average 2½ percent pace observed in the decade prior to the pandemic.  \nThis burst of consumption has been particularly apparent for long -lasting durable goods  as the \n\n \n2 \n pandemic scrambled typical spending patterns away from services, such as gyms, restaurants,  \nand movie theaters , and  towards goods, such as treadmills, kitchen appliances , and home \nentertainment systems.  Although there is good reason to think spending patterns will eventually \nreturn to pre -pandemic trends, the demand for goods has shown only modest signs of abating  so \nfar, and spending on many services remains depressed .  \nOveral l consumption has been supported by strong income growth.  Since the beginning \nof 2020, personal income has increased at a faster rate than in any two-year period in  the past 15 \nyears, first as the result of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefi ts and then with \nthe rapid recovery in the labor market with employment increasing and wages rising.  Households \nnow hold over $2 trillion in additional savings relative to pre -pandemic trends , positioning them \nwith the capacity to spend.    \nThis robust demand has outpaced the available supply of goods and services , especially \nas pandemic-related disruptions continue to weigh on product and labor markets , and \ngeopolitical conflict has further impeded the supply of many commodities .  \nProduction bottlenecks and shortages  originated  in the rapid closing and subsequent slow \nreopening of the economy during the pandemic. The range of disruptions across factories and \nacross countries has jumbled global supply chains , as have disruptions to tr ansportation \nnetworks. Signs of improvement are s lowly  emerging . The New York Fed’s index of global \nsupply chain pressures fell notably in January and February, and inventories rose faster at the end of 2021 than any time since 2015, suggesting that compan ies are finding ways to work around \nthese constraints . \nA lack of labor also has been an important supply constraint. Contacts in my region \ncontinue to express concern about labor shortages. These reports align with the data, reflecting \nthe ratio of job ope nings per unemployed person near all -time highs and workers quitting jobs at \na record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent in \nFebruary while wage gains have been picking up in recent months .  \nStill, many wor kers remain on the sidelines.  In February, the labor force participation rate \nremained 1 percentage point below its pre -pandemic level. Taking into account the trend decline \nin participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of roughly 2 m illion workers. \nUnderstanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor market, and how persistent these \n\n \n3 \n factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the economy will grow, as well as the \nsplit between output growth and higher inflation.   \nWhy have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key \nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In February, 1.2 million pe ople reported \nnot being in the labor force because of Covid. Throughout the pandemic, issues i n childcare \navailability have stood out as a key constraint on labor force participation.  And here things are \nnot yet back to normal.  Employment in daycare facilities, a proxy for capacity, has only slowly \nrecovered and remains 1 1 percent below pre -pandemi c levels. However, it is not only childcare. \nEmployment in nursing and residential care facilities has declined some 12 percent since the \nbeginning of 2020, and it has shown almost no recovery  to date.  This substantial shift in family \ncare responsibilities towards households  may take some time to resolve .  \nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the \nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are generally not \nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the pandemic could have in elevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much of the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect workers moving from employment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to work.\n1 In normal times, there is a regular flow of retired individuals who move back into \nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest  or in other cases out of necessity. During the \npandemic it appears as though more retirees decid ed to stay retired, perhaps related to pandemic \nconcern s or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and \nfinancial security. A c hange associated with either reason could bring some fraction of these \nworkers back over time . \nThese supply constraints in the face of strong demand are  pushing  up inflation  to a 40-\nyear high.  CPI inflation was nearly 8 percent in February, with  core inflation, stripping out food \nand energy prices, at 6.4 percent.  Initially , the run-up in inflation was primarily associated with a \nfew specific goods, particularly cars  (new, used, and rented ). This led to assumptions that such \nprice pressures would dissipate.  But rather tha n being short -lived , inflation has broadened its \nreach . Currently, inflation for almost half of a typical consumer’s purchase bundle is far above  a \nfive-year average.  Consumer sentiment has plummeted as a result.  \n \n1 What Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n \n4 \n The outlook for inflation will be affected in several ways.  Supply constraints can be \nexpected to ease as workers re-enter the labor force and transportation and production networks \nuntangle , taking some pressure off inflation.  The timeline for seeing this relief is highly \nuncertain.  Demand growth is also expected to cool, as fiscal policy becomes less expansionary \nand monetary policy accommodation is removed to stabilize prices . That process is just getting \nunderway.  \nAt present, g lobal dynamics p ose upside risks to th e inflation outlook.  Although the \npandemic has fortunately taken a backseat in the U.S., effects continue to be felt in other parts of \nthe world with the capacity to disrupt . The U.K. and Europe are witnessing rising case counts as \nan even newer variant takes hold.  A particularly saliant risk is the continued threat of lockdowns \nin China as that country’s zero-Covid strategy runs up against ever more transm issible  variants.  \nShutdowns, of course, will aggr avate already disrupted global supply chains, likely boosting \nprices, even as the lockdowns could weigh on China’s demand and global growth.   \nAdditionally , the conflict in Ukraine presents a variety of risks to the outlook, both on the \nsupply and the demand side.  Prices have moved up sharply for a number of commodities, both as \nUkrainian production has been affected  and as sanctions limit Russian exports.  Given Russia’s \nimportance in global energy production, we have seen a sharp rise in oil and natural gas prices . \nThe conflict has further boost ed inflation, and it threatens to extend or worsen supply chain \ndisruptions.    \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nAgainst this backdrop of high inflation, l ast week, the FOMC began adjusting the stance \nof policy.  The Committee raised the policy rate by 25 basis points and signal ed that it will soon \nbegin the process of running down the Fed’s  balance sheet.   \nGiven the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment \nrate near record lows, it is clear that removing accommodation is required . How much and how \naggressively accommodation should be removed  is far more uncertain .  \nReal interest rates —that is, the interest rate adjusted for the pace of inflation —remain  \nhighly negative, encouraging borrowing and consumption.  In addition , the balance sheet now \nstands at a record $9 trillion.  By holding a substantial share of U.S. Treasury debt  as well as \nmortgage -backed securities  (MBS), these asset holdings are putting significant downward \n\n \n5 \n pressure on longer -run interest rates, by some estimates lowering the yield on the 10-year \nTreasury by 150 basis points.2 All in all, monetary policy is likely as accommodative as it has \never been at a time when inflation is well above the Fed’s target and labor markets are tight.   \n \nConsiderations in the Removal of Accommodation  \nWith the current stance of monetary policy out of sync with the state of the economy, \npolicymakers face a challenging set of global and domestic dynamics as they begin the proc ess \nof removing accommodation.  My own thinking about the approach to removing accommodation  \nis influenced by several considerations . \nThe f irst takes into account co ntinued risks to the outlook  associated with further \npandemic -related disruptions in Europe and Asia as well as spillovers from the Russia -Ukraine \nconflict.  While m uch of the economic fallout so far has been directed towards further disruptions \nto supply, both of these risks have implications for demand  as well as supply. Assessing the \nbalance in real time will be difficult.  Recognizing t hese risks is not an argument for stalling the \nremoval of accommodation, but it does suggest a steady , deliberate approach for the path of \npolicy could provide space to monitor developments as they unfold. \nAnother consideration for policymakers is judging how responsive economic activit y is \nto the level of the interest rate . This responsiveness is likely to change over time and with the \nstate of the economy . For example, with consumption skewed towards durable goods , which tend \nto be more interest -sensitive than other components of spending, it is possible that higher rates \nwill have a more pronounced impact on the economy than observed in the past.  On the other \nhand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and healthy household balance sheets might make \nconsumption more resilient to higher interest rates, requiring a steeper path of rate increases to slow demand growth and bring inflation down . A steady , deliberate approach to removing \naccommodation will allow policymakers to observe where this equilibrium might be .  \nFinally, the interaction of higher policy rates with a large balance sheet  will need to be \nconsidered . Raising short -term rates while the balance sheet continues to depress longer -term \nyields will contribute to a flattening and inversion of the yield curve . Already, as market s have \nanticipated a rapid increase in short -term rates, the spread between the yield on the 2-year and \n \n2 The summary of estimates reported in Swanson (2021)  imply that the Feder al Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of \nfederal agency a nd longer -term Treasury debt is depressing the 10 -year Treasury yield by roughly 150 basis points.  \n\n \n6 \n 10-year Treasury  bond turned negative yesterday . While many factors influence longer -term \nyields, including the growth outlook, foreign demand for Treasuries, and the quantity and \nmaturity of Treasury debt issuance , the Fed’s asset holdings also play a role . These purchase s \naimed to depress long -term rates , and the roll-off of these assets is likely to put some upward \npressure on those rates , possibly steepening the yield curve . \nMy concern about an inverted yield curve does not reflect its intensely debated  value as a \npredictor of recession.   Rather, my view is that an inverted curve  has implications for financial \nstability  with incentives for reach -for-yield behavior . An inverted yield curve also pressures  \ntraditional bank lending models that rely on net interest margins, or the spread between borrowing short and lending long. Community banks in p articular rely on net interest margins to \nmaintain their profitability, with rural  areas especially dependent on community banks.   \nAs the FOMC begins the process of removing accommodation, not only will the policy \nrate need to rise, but the balance sheet will need to decline significantly.  Negative real rates and a \nlarge balance sheet have distortive effects . For example, b y owning roughly one -quarter of the \nMBS market along with a significant portfolio of longer -term Treasuries, our presence in \nfinancial markets muddies  price signals, encourages excessive risk -taking, and can f oster \nfinancial instability.  Asset prices remain historically high and remain vulnerable to economic and \npolicy uncertainty.  \n Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment \nrate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate.  At the \nsame time, the factors I noted e arlier, including monitoring risks, the responsiveness of activity \nto interest rate changes, and yield curve developments  will be important guide s to that pace in \nmy view .  \nThe degree to which fading disruptions contribute to an easing of inflation and the lags of \npolicy actions will be relevant  for what happens after more -neutral  policy settings are \naccomplished . If at that point inflation shows signs of remaining elevated, more restrictive policy \nmay be required to meet our price stability objective and to reinforce an anchoring of inflation expectations.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n Concluding Thoughts  \nThe start of a tightening cycle is always fraught with challenges . The public ’s focus \nquickly pivot s from asking “When will they start?” to “When will they stop?”   \nThe previous tightening cycle initiated in  December 2015  proved to be a difficult \ntransition.  Although the initial rate increase was almost fully expected, it soon became apparent \nthat “expect ed” was not the same as “understood.”  And it proved challenging to articulate a \ncompelling narrative for the path of policy throughout 2016 .  \nOf course, today’s policy landscape is quite different.  The rationale for removing \naccommodation is not difficult when inflation is high, demand is strong, and the labor market is \nhot. Under those conditions, a  soft landing is possible but not guaranteed.  While an outlook of \neasing supply constraints and moderating demand growth is consistent with inflation stepping \ndown even as  the labor market remains strong, less favorable outcomes are certainly possible.  In \nthe event high inflation persists while  demand turns down , and the labor market falters , \npolicymaker resolve could be tested.  \nIf the assumption of tem porary pandemic effects on supply and demand proves to be \noverstated, and the imbalance between strong demand and lagging supply persists , the potential \nto dislodge inflation expectations and price -setting dynamics  will further complicate \npolicymakers’ task . Here the comparison to the 1970s is apparent, when persistently high \ninflation over several years led to the  unanchoring of inflation expectations that then beca me \nembedded in price and wage setting behavior.  Unlike that period, however, Fed policymakers \ntoday have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to restore price stability . \nStill, the landscape we face is murk y. Uncertainty and risks  seem likely to accompany \neach step on the path to policy normalization, demanding equal doses of flexibility  and resolve ."

            "content": "The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \n \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nJanuary 31, 2022 \nThe Economic Club of Indiana  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Thanks to the Economic Club of Indiana for inviting me to speak today. I’m pleased to be \nhere in person, something I no longer take for granted after the experience of the past two years, \nto share my thoughts on the economy during this extraordinary time.  \nThe global pandemic hit the U.S. in full force two years ago and although its effects are \nstill with us, the U.S. economy rebounded quickly. Looking back, 2021 saw several  notable \neconomic developments , including the largest increase in employment on record as well as the \nmost significant pick -up in inflation in decades . The effects of a global pandemic and the \nextraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal and monetary, drove those outcomes  and \nwill likely continue to set the course for the economy this year .  \nI’ll talk about three key dimensions  that will influ ence economic activity in the coming \nyear: the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the outlook for  monetary policy.   \n The Outlook for Demand   \nThe outlook for demand is a positive one.  Spending was robust  at the end of last year, \nwith retail sales in the fourth quarter almost 20 percent higher than the same period in 2020, the \nlargest annual increase on record. With the new year,  the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the \nOmicron variant has muddled the picture  somewhat . Real GDP increased a solid 6.9  percent in \nfourth quarter, but t he surge in new cases has led  many forecasters to revise  down the ir \nprojections  for the beginning of the year, even though there is a generally  held view that \neconomic activity, and spending  in particular , has become more resilient to spikes in the virus.  \nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to \nsupport solid consumption growth.  Notably, household income  continue s to increase rapidly.  \nNominal la bor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in \n\n2 \n employment  and wages.  With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, m ore \npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy.  This is p articularly true \nfor the wage gains going to lower -income workers, a group that has traditionally spent a \nrelatively large share of their paychecks.  \nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by health ier household balance sheets.  \nSignificant f iscal tran sfers, along with  subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed  many  to \naccumulate saving s and pay down debt.  Households now have over $2 trillion in additional \nsaving s relative to pre -pandemic trends , and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house \nprices near record highs , have also boosted wealth.  While it is possible that households could \ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic, \nmany have the capacity to spend.  \nAnother factor suppor ting demand growth is a robust outlook for s tate and local \ngovernment spending . With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget  \nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021.  And while fiscal policy at the federal level is \nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels, \nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the \nlargest increase in 15 years.   \nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the persistence of the virus is likely to  \nfurther delay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the \npast two years . Throughout  the pandemic,  consumers have favored the purchase of goods, \nparticularly durable goods . For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential \nremodeling and upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances . It also inspired purchase s \nof home exercise eq uipment and bicycle sales.  Although durable goods consumption has fallen \n\n3 \n from its peak, the level remains 10 percent higher than  its pre-pandemic trend, and there are \nindicators it might be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases . This  is \nparticularly true for automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.   \nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as \nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances a nd movies, and \nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists.  The same is true with business travel still \ndisrupted; hotels  and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the \nmiddle seat of a n overbooked flight) .  \n \nThe Outlook for Supply  \nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services , 2021 saw supply lag demand \nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods . The result was higher prices . With \noverall demand expected to remain strong , a key question for the outlook is whether supply will \nbe able to keep up, particularly as the ongoing public health concerns related to the pandemic \nthreaten to delay a rotation of consumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack \nservices  sector . Whether or not supply is able rise to the occasion in part will be determined by \nthe persistence of pandemic-related disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor markets.   \nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to product ion bottlenecks and shortages, \nmany originating in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy in 2020.  \nThe range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled gl obal supply \nnetworks, as ha ve disruptions to transportation networks , including the carefully choreographed \nmovement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collaps ing in disarray.  Slowly, \n\n4 \n these disruptions are being dealt with , and there are i ndications that the wors t has passed  as \nshipping rates have peaked  and port backlogs are being cleared.  Imports and inventories both \nincreased sharply in the fourth quarter, suggesting that supply is on the mend. Reports of supplier \ndelivery delays declined in December  even as they remain at historically elevated level s. Still, \nglobal  supply networks continue to face risks, particularly those going through China where a \nzero-Covid policy and strict lockdowns are running up against the highly transmissible O micron \nvariant.   \nA lack of l abor also has been an  important constraint on supply.  Speaking to contacts in \nmy region, reports of acute labor shortages  are prevalent . These reports align with  the data , \nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near  all-time high s and workers \nquitting jobs at a record pace.  The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate f alling  \nbelow 4.0 percent in December  and wage growth picking up solidly.   \nThis tight labor market reflects the strength of demand but  also constrain ts on the supply \nof labor . In December, t he labor force participation rate remain ed 1.5 percentage points below its \npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months.  Taking into account the \ntrend decline in labor force participation as the po pulation ages, this amounts to a shortage of \nroughly 3.5 million workers.  Understanding w hat is keeping these workers out of the labor \nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the \neconomy will grow, as wel l as the split between output growth and higher inflation.   \nSo why have workers left the labor market?  The pandemic likely remains a key \nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly . In December , more than a million \nworkers reported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime -age workers and \ndisproportionately  women . Through out the pandemic , issues in childcare availability surfaced as \n\n5 \n a key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likel y to be prolonged by the \nrecent surge in the virus and renewed school closures.  Employment in daycare facilities remains \n10 percent below pre -pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to recover.  \nHowever, it is not only children. E mploym ent in nursing and residential care facilities has \ndeclined 12 percent relative to the start of 2020, suggesting that  there has been a substantial shift \nin family care responsibilities  towards households during the pandemic.   \nAnother contributor to lower l abor force participation has been a large increase in the \nproportion of the  population that report s being retired.  While these workers are largely not \nattributing their lack of workforce participation to the pandemic, I would not dismiss its role in \nelevating the retirement rate . Looking  at detailed data, it appears much of the increase in the \nreported retired population does not reflect  workers moving from employment to retirement but \nrather a sharp slowdown in the number of retir ees returning to work.  In normal times , there is a \nregular flow of retired individuals who move  back into employment, in some cases out of \npersonal interest or in other cases out of necessity.  Today, it appears as though more retirees are \ndeciding to stay retired, perhaps because of concern over illness or as buoyant equity and \nhousing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and financial security.  If concern over illness \nis a prime motivating factor, some fraction  of these workers may decide to return to  the \nworkforce as the pandemic fades.  \nOf course,  the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential \nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets.  We are already \nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce  with absenteeism disrupti ng \nbusiness activity and production.  This d ynamic has been particularly apparent in the airline \nindustry, as a lack of employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel.  It will also \n\n6 \n likely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines waiting for \nthe situation to improve.   \nThe ongoing influence of the virus has obviously added uncertainty to the outlook .  \nHowever , I don’t expect it has changed the overall picture  of strong demand continuing to push \nup on constrained supply.  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy?  Monetary policy plays an \nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating the growth of demand.  When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and long -\nrun growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary po licy that moderates \nthe pace of demand growth.  By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up, \nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.  \nMonetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of accommodation to the \neconomy.  With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real interest rates, or interest rates \nadjusted for inflation, are near  record lows.  In addition to the low policy rate, the Fed has \nincreased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large amounts of T reasuries and \nmortgage -backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings to nearly $9 trillion. By \nremoving securities from the market, these purchases apply notable  downward pressure on \nlonger -term interest rates and lower borrowing costs. Asset valuations also respond as investors \nseek returns in alternative and perhaps riskier investments.   \nWith inflation running at close to a 40 -year high, considerable momentum in demand \ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very \n\n7 \n accommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook . At last \nweek’s meeting, the FOMC acknowledged the need to shift its policy settings with interest rate \nincreases and significant reductions in asset holdings  on the horizon.  \nRemoving accommodation is easily justified, but it is unavoidably complicated by the use \nof multiple policy instruments , as it was during the last normalization cycle less than a decade \nago. To guide this process, the FOMC released a set of general principles for reducing the size of \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These principles keep  the federal funds rate as the primary \ntool of policy adjustments with  planned significant reductions in the balance sheet to begin after \nthe policy rate had increased . The principles also reaffirm the Committee’s ample reserves \noperating regime and an intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long -run, moving \naway from holding mortgage -backed securities to minimize possible distortions in credit \nallocation.   \nThese principles  establish important guideposts as the Federal Reserve begins to dial \nback  its policy settings . However, they are just a start, and a number of important and difficult \ndecisions remain. In particular, I expect it will be important to consider the interaction  between \nreductions in the  size of the balance sheet and increases in the policy  rate. What we do on the \nbalance sheet will likely affect the path of policy rates and vice versa. For example, m ore \naggressive action on the balance sheet could allow for a shallower path for the policy rate. Alternatively, combining a  relatively steep path of rate increases with relatively modest \nreductions in the balance sheet  could flatten the yield curve and distort incentives for private \nsector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater economic and financial \nfragility by prompting reach-for -yield behavior from long -duration investors.   \n\n8 \n In the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjus ting the size of the balance \nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way .” The rationale for this \ntiming  was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for space to \noffset any unexpected turbulence. T his rationale seems less compelling now  and, from my \nperspective, discounts the yield curve i mplications of moving the funds rate higher while \nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, it could be appropriate to move earlier on the \nbalance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.   \nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the principles state an intention to \nmaintain securities holdings in an amount needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and \neffectively in an ample reserves regime.  I expect that this will be an amount that will be difficult \nto identify with any precision, particularly as the banking sector’s  demand for reserves is likely \nto evolve over time , perhaps in ways that is hard to predict . While it might be tempting  to err on \nthe side of caution, the potential costs associated with an excessively large balance sheet  should \nnot be ignored.    \nI would describe those costs in three aspects.  One is the distortive effects of the size of \nthe Fed’s balance sheet  on the financi al system.  A large Fed presence in markets can displace \nprivate activity, even in a market as large and liquid as that for U .S. Treasuries and certainly \nwhere the central bank holds roughly 1/4 of the MBS market. This presence can distort price signals, cu rrently most evident in the pricing of duration.  By holding long duration assets, the \nFed’s balance sheet is depressing the price of duration, by lowering longer -term yields by as \nmuch as 1. 5 percentage points  according to some rules -of-thumb , incentivizing reach -for-yield \nbehavior and increasing fragility within the financial system.\n1 As we purchased assets, our goal \n \n1 The summary of  estimates reported in  Swanson (2021)  imply that the Federal Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of \nfederal agency a nd longer -term Treasury debt is depressing  the 10 -year Treasury  yield by roughly 150 basis points.   \n\n9 \n was in part to artificially depress term premia, pushing down long -run rates and supporting \neconomic activity . In normalizing our balance sheet , we should aim to eliminate this \ndistortion.       \nSecond, and related, maintaining a large balance sheet reduces available policy space in \nthe inevitable next downturn.  With the zero lower bound  likely to  bind for short -term rates, the \ntrend decline in long -term rates has also decreased the amount of policy space we have at the \nlonger end of the curve.  Just as increases in the policy rate provide us with space to cut short -\nterm rates, decreasing the size o f our balance sheet, and increasing term premia, could provide \nspace to push down long -run yields in the next downturn .2   \nFinally, a large balance sheet has the potential to intertwine fiscal and monetary policy in \nthe public’s eyes  and could unintentionally pose risks to the Fed’s independence and authority.3 \nIn a rising rate environment, t his risk could become more apparent as interest paid on the  large \nstock of reserve liabilities  grows . \nWith these costs in mind, we are likely to face  a different set of challenges and \nconsequential decisions than we did with our previous experience with balance sheet \nadjustments. In following through on these principles for reducing our asset holdings, the \ndifferences are notable, considering the current balance sheet is historically large relative to the \nsize of the economy, and the economy itself is in a far different place. In 2015, inflation was well \nbelow 1 percent; the unemployment rate was 5 percent; and the economy was growing just under \n2 percent annually. The balance sheet was half the size it is today. The starting point for policy \n \n2 Mone tary Policy is one of many factors affecting long -term interest ra tes, including international developments, \nthe growth outlook, a nd the quantity a nd maturity of federal debt issuance.  \n3 See “ The Importance of Central Bank Independence ,” remarks delivered virtually at the Conference on “ Central \nBa nk Independence, Mandates and Policies ,” hosted by the Economics and Business School, Universidad de Chile, \nOctober 21, 2021.  \n\n10 \n adjustments in 2022 stand s in stark contrast to the 2015 experience with high inflation, tight \nlabor markets, a robust demand outlook, and elevated asset valuations .   \nEven as the pandemic continues  to influence econom ic activity, monetary policy is \ntransitioning away from its current crisis stance towards a more n eutral posture  in the interest of \nmeeting its long -run objectives . Policymakers will need to grapple with the  appropriate  pace and \nsize of adjustment s across multiple policy tools  in the context of a changing and challenging \nenvironment.  That transition could be a bumpy one , with the prospect of  asset valuation \nadjust ments  and the recalibration of supply and demand towards a  new equilibrium."

It’s a pleasure to begin this New Year with the Central Exchange. This \nis an important organization for women in Kansas City who contribute actively to our \ncommunity in so many different ways , and it provides an important forum to share ideas, \nexperiences and opportunities. The Kansas City Fed suppo rts these goal s, and I’m pleased that \nwomen play an important role on the Boards of Directors of our four offices , on our executive \nmanagement team , and across all aspects of our public mission . In fact, several members of our \nleadership team are members o f the Central Exchange, and I know their involvement has \nbenefited them personally and professionally.  \nIt’s also an honor to begin the New Year by continuing the tradition of sharing my \noutlook for the economy here at the Central Exchange , something I first did in January 2012 \nshortly after I became president of the Kansas City Fed.  It was a time of recovery in the U.S. \neconomy after a terrible financial crisis and Federal Reserve policymakers were deliberating on how and when to unwind an extraordinary monetary policy response .  \nA decade later, the U.S. economy again finds itself recovering from a n unprecedented \nshock with Federal Reserve policymakers contemplating how and when to unwind an \nunprecedented monetary policy response . To be clear, the challenges we face today are quite \ndifferent in many respects even as the uncertainty that accompanies policymaking choices has \nfamiliar refrains.  \nLooking back, 2021 saw several  notable economic developments , including the largest \nincrease in employment on record as well as the most significant pick -up in inflation in decades . \nThe effects of a global pandemic and the extraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal and monetary, drove those outcomes  and will likely continue to set the course for the economy \nthis year .  \n\n2 \n In my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about three key dimensions  that will influence \neconomic activity in the coming year : the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the \noutlook for  monetary policy.   \n \nThe Outlook for Demand   \nThe outlook for demand is a positive one.  Spending was robust  going into the holiday \nseason , with November retail sales edging up following a large jump in October.  Recent \nindicators point to continued strong demand even as the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the \nOmicron variant threatens to muddle the picture  somewhat . With newly reported ca ses now at \nall-time highs, many forecasters are revising down the ir projections  for the beginning of the year, \nthough there is a generally  held view that economic activity, and spending  in particular , has \nbecome more resilient to spikes in the virus.  \nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to \nsupport solid consumption growth.  Notably, household income  continue s to increase rapidly.  \nNominal labor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in \nemployment  and wages.  With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, m ore \npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy.  This is p articularly true \nfor the wage gains going to lower -income workers, a group tha t has traditionally spent a \nrelatively large share of their paychecks.  \nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by health ier household balance sheets.  \nSignificant f iscal transfers, along with  subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed  many  to \naccumulate saving s and pay down debt.  Households now have over $2 trillion in additional \nsaving s relative to pre -pandemic trends , and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house \n\n3 \n prices near record highs , have also boosted wealth.  While it is possible  that households could \ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic, \nmany have the capacity to spend.  \nAnother factor supporting demand growth is a robust outlook for s tate and local \ngovernment spending . With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget  \nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021.  And while fiscal policy at the federal level is \nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels, \nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the \nlargest increase in 15 years.   \nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the surge in the virus is likely to  further \ndelay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the past two \nyears . Throughout  the pandemic,  consumers have favored the purchase of goods, particularly \ndurable goods . For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential remodeling \nand upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances . It also inspired purchases  of home \nexercise equipment and bicycle sales.  Although durable goods consumption has fallen from its \npeak, the level remains 10 percent higher than its pre-pandemic trend, and there are indicators it \nmight be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases . This is particularly true \nfor automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.   \nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as \nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances and movies, and \nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists.  The same is true with bu siness travel still \ndisrupted, hotels and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the middle seat of a n overbooked flight) .  \n\n4 \n  \nThe Outlook for Supply  \nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services , 2021 saw supply lag demand \nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods . The result was higher prices . With \noverall demand expected to remain strong , a key question for the outlook is whether supply will \nbe able to keep up, particularly as the Omicron variant threatens to delay a rotation of \nconsumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack service s sector . Whether or \nnot supply is able  rise to the occasion in part will be determined by the persistence of pandemic -\nrelated disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor markets.   \nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to product ion bottlenecks and shortages, \nmany originati ng in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy during the \npandemic.  The range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled global \nsupply networks, as ha ve disruptions to transportation networks , including the carefully \nchoreographed movement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collaps ing in \ndisarray.  Slowly, these disruptions are being dealt with , and there are indications that the wors t \nhas passed  as shipping rates have peaked  and port backlogs are being cleared.  Reports of supplier \ndelivery delays declined in December  even as they remain at historically elevated level s.      \nA lack of l abor also has been an  important constraint on supply.  Speaking to contacts in \nmy region, I hear consistent reports of labor shortages.  These reports align with  the data , \nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near  all-time high s and workers \nquitting jobs at a record pace.  The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate f alling \nto 3.9 percent in December  and wage growth picking up solidly.  The strength of the labor market \n\n5 \n is even more apparent within some parts of our region, with the unemployment rate in Nebraska \ndropping to 1.8 percent, a record low for any state.  \nThis tight labor market  reflects the strength of demand but  also constrain ts on the supply \nof labor . In December, t he labor force participation rate remain ed 1.5 percentage points below its \npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months.  Taking into account the \ntrend decline in labor force participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of \nroughly 3.5 million workers.  Understand ing w hat is keeping these workers out of the labor \nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the \neconomy will grow, as well as the split between output growth and higher inflation.   \nSo why have workers left  the labor market?  The pandemic likely remains a key \nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly . In December , 1.1 million persons \nreported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime -age workers and \ndisproportionately  women . Through out the pandemic , issues in childcare availability have stood \nout as a key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likely to be prolonged \nby the recent surge in the virus and renewed school closures.  Employment in daycare facilities \nremains 10 percent below pre -pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to \nrecover.  However, it is not only children. E mployment in nursing and residential care facilities \nhas declined 12 percent relative to the start of 2 020, suggesting that  there has been a substantial \nshift in  family care responsibilities  towards households during the pandemic.   \nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the \nproportion of the  population that repor ts being retired.  While these workers are largely not \nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the \npandemic  could have in elevating the retirement rate . Looking  at detailed data, it appears much \n\n6 \n of the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect  workers moving from \nemployment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to \nwork.  In normal times , there is a regular  flow of retired individuals who move  back into \nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest or in other cases out of necessity.  During the \npandemic it appears as though more retirees are deciding to stay retired, perhaps because of \nconcern over illness or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs \nand financial security.  If concern over illness is a prime motivating factor, some fraction  of these \nworkers are likely to return as the pandemic fades.  \nOf course,  the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential \nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets.  We are already \nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce  with disruption to business \nactivity and production.  This d ynamic surfaced in the airline industry over the holidays, as a lack \nof employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel.  The surge in the virus will \nalso likely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines \nwaiting for the situation to improve.  While this new variant has added uncertainty to the outlook, \nI don’t believe it has changed the overall picture  of strong demand continuing to push up on \nconstrained supply.  \n \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy?  Monetary policy plays an \nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating \nthe growth of demand.  When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and long -\n\n7 \n run growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary policy that moderates \nthe pace of demand growth.  By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up, \nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.  \nBy many metrics monetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of \naccommodation to the economy.  With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real \ninterest rates, or interest rates adjusted for inflation, are near  record lows.  In addition to the low \npolicy rate, the Fed has  increased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large \namounts of t reasuries and m ortgage -backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings \nto over $8.5 trillion.  By removing securities from the market, these purchases apply notable  \ndownward pressure on longer -term interest rates while pushing investors to look for alternative \nand perhaps riskier investments.   \nWith inflation running at close to a 40 -year high, considerable momentum in demand \ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very \naccommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook . Even after \naccounting for  the FOMC ’s decision  at its Decemb er meeting to accelerate the  timeline for \nending asset purchases , the balance sheet will grow further until March . \nRemoving accommodation will unavoidably be complicated by the use of multiple policy \ninstruments – short term rates and large -scale asset purchases  – as it was during the last \nnormalization cycle a decade ago . As policymakers chart a course for withdrawing this \naccommodation, it will be important in my view to c onsider the interaction between the ultimate  \nsize of the balance sheet and the longer -run normal f unds rate.  All else equal, maintaining a large  \nbalance sheet c ould imply a higher short -term interest rate  to offset the stimulative effect of the \nbalance sheet’s continued downward pressure on longer -term interest rates.  An approach of \n\n8 \n raising rates while maintaining an outsized balance sheet  could flatten the yield curve and distort \nincentives for private sector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater \neconomic and financial fragility by prompting reach -for-yield behavior from long -duration \ninvestors.  For that reason, m y own preference would be to opt for running down the  balance \nsheet  earlier rather than later as we plot a path for removing monetary accommodation.  \nIn the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjusting the size of the balance \nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way .” The rationale for this \ntiming  was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for spac e to \noffset any unexpected turbulence. T his rationale seems less compelling now  and, from my \nperspective, discounts the yield curve i mplications of moving the funds rate higher while \nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, I believe that it will be appropriate to move earlier \non the balance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.   \nEven as the pandemic continues  to influence econom ic activity, the time has come to \ntransition monetary policy away from its current crisis stance towards a more normal posture  in \nthe interest of long -run stability.  With robust demand, high inflation, and a tight labor market, \npolicymakers will need to grapple with the  appropriate  speed and magnitude of adjustment s \nacross multiple policy tools  as they work to achieve their long -run objectives for employment \nand price stability. That transition could be a bumpy one , with the prospect of  asset valuation \nadjust ments  and the recalibration of supply and demand towards a  new equilibrium."

A lot has happened since we conv ened  last November , \nincluding the widespread distribution of vaccines  and a further reopening of the economy . The \nvirus continues its disruptive presence, though to lesser degree.  For the economy, the key \ndevelopment has been  a seemingly  abrupt transition  from a  world  of demand shortfalls to one of  \nsupply constraints . Surging demand over the course of 2021, supported by aggressive fisca l \npolicy and accommodative monetary policy, has pushed on a supply side that continues to suffer  \npandemic -related disruptions .  \nThe combination of resurgent demand and constrained supply has pushed up prices , both \nin energy markets and in the broader economy.  The price of oil has doubled over the past year, \nwith WTI increasing from about $40 a barrel  to over $80 a barrel, while domestic natural gas \nprices have risen almost 150 percent.  Aggregate inflation also has picked up significantly , rising \nto 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September, the fastest pace in over 30 years and \nconsiderably higher than the 1.1 percent rate recorded last November . While higher  energy \nprices have  contributed to this increase, when its impact is excluded,  inflation still remains \nelevated at 3.7 percent.       \nWith increasing prices dominating headlines, the central question confronting economic \nforecasters  and policymakers  at the Fed  is just how long  this elevated inflation  will persist . The \nanswer to this question depends  fundamentally on how long the current tightness in the economy \ncontinues, and, in turn, the outlook for both supply and demand.  While movements in energy \nprices are frequently attributed to  supply developments, the importance of supply fo r broader \nprice mo vements had been increasingly called into question prior to the pandemic . A long period \nof lackluster demand growth following the 2008 financial crisis  accompanied by muted inflation  \nhad taken some emphasis off the role of supply constraints in determining  the level  of inflation . \nJust prior to the pandemic, the importance of th e relationship between supply and inflation had \nreached a low point . After decades of viewing the relationship between the unemployment rate \nand inflation  (summarized by the Phillips Curve ) as a central constraint on  how hot the economy \ncould run without  sparking inflation , many questioned the continued relevance of this constraint .   \n Today, I  would like to briefly touch on the price dynamics  in both energy markets and \nthe overall economy before considering what lessons the energy market might provide for the \n\n2 \n consideration of price dynamics in the overall economy, and then end with some thoughts on the \noutlook for monetary policy.  \n \nRecent Developments  \nAcross a variety of energy commodities, d evelopments in both supply and demand have \nled to rapid price increases . For oil, a reopening economy has pushed up demand,  with global oil \nconsumption rapidly returning to  pre-pandemic levels , significantly  lifting  crude  prices. Despite \nhigher prices, U.S. oil producers appear wary to ramp up production on the heels of  the collapse \nin prices early in the pandemic.  OPEC has also shown restraint , sticking to previously agreed \nproduction quotas,  even as prices have cli mbed.  The price moves for natural gas have been even \nmore dramatic, especially in Europe, where low inventories  coming off a n especially cold winter \nlast year and weak renewable production during the summer coupled with resurgent demand—in \npart as climate considerations shifted electric al generation away from coal —ha ve led to surging  \nprices .   \nLikewise , we see  the interaction of demand and supply  dynamics creating price pressures \nin the broader  economy . Fiscal transfers in the United States  have supported incomes and \nspending . This has been particularly true for goods , as the pandemic led consumers to rotate \nconsumption from in-person services towards purchases for their homes.  Strong demand has led \nto a remarkable increase in prices for durable goods, which rose  over 7 percent in the previous  12 \nmonths following 25 years of consistent price declines.   \nSupply disruptions  have also contributed to the rise in prices . Notably, shortages of \nsemiconductors have constrained output  in a number of industries, including automobiles.  \nSnarled global supply chains have pushed up shipping costs and disrupted the production of a \nwide variety of goods.  Supplier delivery times have slowed dramatically, not only for \nmanufacturers but also for service providers , in part as  shipping times from Asia to the West \nCoast have doubled, and transit costs have skyrocketed.  The number of ships waiting to unload \nat Long Beach has become a commonl y cited economic indicator.  Inventories have been \ndepleted, with the retail inventory -to-sales ratio running 30 percent below its historic averag e and \nat all-time low s.   \nThere are also widespread reports that a lack of available labor is  curtailing production in \nmany industries, contributing to kinks in the supply chain and pushing up prices.  A number of \n\n3 \n indicators point towards a tight labor market.  Reported unfilled job openings are at  record levels, \nwhile the rate at which workers are q uitting their jobs, a typical sign of a tight labor market, is at \nan all -time high.  Wage growth has also accelerated, particularly for lower -income hourly \nworkers.  \nIt is important to note that the tightness in the labor market could prove temporary as a \nsizable number of people , about 5 million,  remain  out of work relative to before the pandemic . \nThese workers are roughly split between those reporting being unemployed and those who report \nno longer being in the labor force.  Non-college educated women with children represent a large \nportion of those that have dropped out of the labor force, suggesting that disruptions to childcare \nremain a barrier to work for many.  In particular, daycare capacity appears to have fallen 10 \npercent relative to pre-pandemi c levels.  A full recovery of the labor market appears unlikely until \nchildcare normalizes.    \n \nLessons from Energy Markets for the Broader Economy  \nWith the broad economy running into supply constraints to an extent that we have not  \nwitnessed  for some time , judging the outlook can be particularly challenging. Looking to the \nexperience of energy markets, where supply developments have long been an important \ncomponent of price fluctuations , we see several lessons that may inform today’s experience .  \nOne lesson from the history of oil price movements  is that it can be very difficult to \ndisentangle the role of supply versus  demand.  Prices are determined by the intersection of supply \nand demand, and the price impact of any particular supply disruption will depend i mportantly on \nthe underlying strength of demand.  The sharp fall in oil prices in 2014 occurred against the \nbackdrop of both a rapid increase in supply associated with the growth of U.S. shale oil \nproduction and relatively weak growth in oil demand as the g lobal economy continued its slow \nrecovery from the financial crisis.  These two factors interacted to cut the price of WTI in half, \nfrom over $100 a barrel to around $50 a barrel, over the second half of 2014.    \nAnother lesson from oil markets is that  precautionary motives are an important \ndeterminant of current demand  and prices . News of an actual or perceived supply shortfall can \nlead to a  desire to increase stockpiles , amplifying the price increase from any given supply \ndisruption.  For example, t he OPEC  shocks of the 1970s led to an increase in demand for  oil \ninventories (and full gas tanks) which then help ed maintain higher prices.  Similarly, in the \n\n4 \n broader economy I am hearing anecdotes  of firms responding to t oday’s supply challenges by \nover-ordering and accumulating precautionary inventories of the necessary inputs to  production, \nincluding semiconductors  and steel. As firms attempt to shore up their supply chains and move  \naway  from a just -in-time production mo del, the incentive to carry higher inventories could \nfurther support prices  across a broad variety of goods .  \n \nLessons for Monetary Policy \nThis history of energy price movements has informed t he conduct of monetary policy.  In \nparticular, energy price shocks have played a key role in developing the thinking around how \nmonetary policy should respond to elevated inflation, particularly inflation that appears to arise from supply developments.  The oil price shocks in the 1970s, the run up in oil prices in the mid-\n2000s , and the collapse in prices in 2014  all provide context for how monetary policy should \nrespond to inflation  developments  with an important supply component.  In particular , experience \nwith energy prices has largely formed the basis for  argumen ts that monetary policy should not \nreact to increases in overall inflation driven primarily by supply developments . I would \ncharacterize these  argument s along two  related  lines.  First, monetary policy should look through \ntemporar y increases in inflation.  Second, monetary policy should not respond aggressively to \nincreases in inflation resulting from a shift in  relative pric es.  \nAlong the first dimension, given that it takes some time for changes in the stance of \nmonetary policy to affect inflation , it is often argued that policymakers should look through \ntemporary changes in inflation.  It is this argument that led to the creation and widespread usage \nof measures of core inflation that exclude energy and food prices. Given the frequ ency of \ntemporary shocks to energy and commodity price inflation  that are  often attributed to supply, \ncore inflation is likely to offer  a better measure of underlying or trend inflation and thus is \nthought to provide an important guide to monetary policy.  This argument was prevalent in 2014 \nand 2015 when a sharp decline in oil prices pulled down overall inflation, and the Federal \nReserve at the time argued that policy should look through this decline on  the assumption that \nthe dip was temporary.    \n\n5 \n Second, there is a large literature suggesting that monetary policy should not respond \naggressively to changes in  relative price s.1 The logic is that relative prices serve as important \nsignals that help to reallocate economic resources to  sector s that are relatively tight from sector s \nthat ha ve excess slack.  Of course, t his reallocation could be achieved  with offsetting  changes in \nprices, an increase in prices in the tight sector s and a decrease in prices in slack sector s, which, in \ntheory,  could leave overall inflation about unchanged.  However, in reality , firms in slack sector s \nhave often found that  cutting prices, and particularly wages, is  difficult.  Thus, with incomplete \nadjustment in slack sector s, relative price changes often end up push ing up overall inflation.  \nTheory suggests it is better for policymakers to accept this increase in inflation, which should be \ntemporary, than to tighten policy and restrict overall activity in an effort to force offsetting price \ndeclines in shrinking sector s. This argument was  frequently made in the mid -2000s as oil prices \nrose steadily  and lifted overall inflatio n, due to perceived shifts in supply and demand in the oil \nsector . Even as higher oil prices contributed to higher overall inflation, it was argued that \npolicymakers should look through this temporary increase in inflation rather than force adjustment s on other sectors of the economy .  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nHow might these lessons apply today?  The timeframe for resolving bottlenecks and the \nscope of categories reflecting price pressures make the answer to this question less than straightforward.   \nDisruptions that  initially appeared to be temporary bottlenecks driving up prices  now \nlook as if they may  be more long -lasting , with widespread reports suggesting that supply chains \nwill not recover until well into 2022.  Additionally , while in the spring the increase in prices was \nbeing driven by select categories  of goods and services,  more recently the increase in prices has \nbecome generalized , and is apparent across a b road swath of the economy . Through May, both \nthe pe rcent of consumer expenditures showing large increases in prices and the percent of \nexpenditures showing large decreases in prices were historically elevated.  However, in recent \nmonths, price s that had been depressed by the pandemic, including hotel accomm odations and \nairfares , have rebound ed, even as prices for goods that have seen price spikes —for example used \n \n1 Including a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium.  Monetary Policy in Times of Structural \nReallocation (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n6 \n cars, appliances, and furniture —remain elevated.  As a consequence, currently 50 percent of  an \naverage household’s expenditure basket is now experiencing unusually higher prices .  \nAs supply chains heal and demand eases, there is reason to expect  inflation will \neventually moderate, but it is also clear that the risk  of a prolonged period of elevated inflati on \nhas increased . The argument for patience in the face of  these inflation pressures has  diminish ed.  \nThis week , the F ederal Reserve started the process of normalizing the stance of monetary \npolicy by announcing its intention to end asset purchases.  The Committee plans to decrease the \npace at which it is purchasing Treasury securities by $10 billion a month and  agency mortgage -\nbacked securities by $5 billion a month, laying out a trajectory for ending these purchases by the \nmiddle of next year.     \nIt is important to note that w hile the pace of asset purchases  is slowing , the cumulative \neffect of these purchases is arguably the more subst antive force acting on the economy. Since \nMarch of last year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of securities, pushing \nour total asset holdings to $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer -term \ninterest rates m ost relevant for households and businesses and thereby are providing a significant \namount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will persist even when tapering is complete.  \nAs the adjustment of asset purchases gets underway, the focus of attention will naturally \nshift to the path of the policy rate. Since last December, the Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with \nmaximum employment and inflation has ri sen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed \n2 percent for some time.  \nTaken together, monetary policy remains highly accommodative in an economy where \ninflation is elevated  and labor markets have yet to fully recover. With both supply and demand \nfactors clearly at play , the choices for policymakers will be complicated as uncertainty remains \nhigh for how temporary or persist ent these frictions will prove to be. \nIn most circum stances , the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate objectives  for maximum \nemployment and stable prices are in alignment, so that the Fed’s policy actions support both objectives simultaneously.  There are however times when the objectives can appear to be in \nconfl ict. And now might be one of those times  with inflation running well ahead of its longer -run \naverage and labor markets appearing to have further room to recover . While the current \n\n7 \n economic alignment certainly adds complexity for policymakers , ending asset purchases is an \nimportant first step along the path to policy normalization  as we balance our long -run objectives \nand seek to promote sustainable growth and financial stability."

The \nfocus on women’s labor force engagement  is particularly important as the econom y recovers , not \nonly for women but also for the economy as a whole.  And so, I’d like to close today’s program \nwith a few thoughts on current labor market dynamics for women.1 \nUnlike prior downturns , the pandemic has weighed more heavily on women than men. \nWomen with less education, especially minorities, lost disproportionately more jobs and e xited \nthe labor force at higher rates during the pandemic recession. Mothers of young children have \ntaken a harder hit than fathers, which stands in contrast with the experience during the Great \nRecession, when participation paths for mothers and fathers w ere similar.2 Lack of affordable \nchildcare options and lack of flexibility with work hours seem to be delaying a return to the labor \nforce for many women, especially minorities.  \nWhen the economy reopened in the summer of 2020 there was a jump  in the participation \nrate for prime -age workers –  both men and women, but since then there has been little  \nimprovement, with the rate remaining almost 1.5  percentage points below its pre -pand emic level.  \nBut the largest and most persistent decline in participation has been among women, and in \nparticular women without a college degree.  Compared to the start of the pandemic, t here are \naround 1.6 million fewer  prime -age workers in the labor force, including 1.2 million fewer \nwomen without a bachelor’s degree . Among these women, Hispanic women, who had the lowest \nparticipation rate before the pandemic, are furthest from a full recovery, with a labor force \npartic ipation rate 8 percent  below the pre-pandemic level.  \nWhere did these women go?  One likely explanation is that s chool and day care closures \nduring the pandemic created challenges for many parents, but especially for those with young \nchildren. A lack of access to childcare, the demands of home and virtual schooling, and health \nconcerns have kept many women with young  children  (age 13 and younger ) out of the labor \nforce.  A substantial body of research shows that , on average,  working women shoulder more \nchildcare responsibilities at home even when they have a spouse present. So, when children had \n \n1 I thank  Kansas City Fed Senior Economist Didem Tuzemen for her assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n2 Lofton, Olivia, Nicolas Petrosky -Nadeau, and Lily Seitelman. “Parental Participation in a Pandemic Labor Market.” \nEconomic Letter . Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.  April  2021 .  \n \n\n2 \n to stay at home because of school and day care closures , mothers often had to pick up the \nadditional childcare responsibilities .  \nThe presence of young children has played an important role in the decline  in non-\ncollege -educated women’s participation  in the la bor fo rce. At the onset of the pandemic, non -\ncollege -educated mothers experienced a large drop in participation . Although participation in this \ngroup improved through the summer  of last year , it fell again with the start of the 2020 school \nyear. Currently, only about 64 percent of these mothers of young children are participating in the \nlabor force, which is almost 6 percent  below the pre -pandemic level. In contrast, the participation \nrate of non-college -educated  women without young children declined less during the downturn \nand recovered  more  afterwards .  \nParticipation rates remain especially depressed among  Black and Hispanic non -college -\neducated  women  with young children, likely related to difficulties in accessing  affordable \nchildcare.  Enrollment in childcare programs dropped substantially when the pandemic hit  in \n2020. Low enrollment and continuing health risks caused  many childcare  providers to shut down \ntheir businesses, especially those in low - and middle -income areas.  As the economy reopened \nand the job market started to recover , anecdotal  evidence suggests that many of these mothers \nfound themselves struggling  to find affordable childcare  programs in their communities. \nTemporary school closures and online  schooling have also made it harder for mothers with \nschool -age children to return to work. The current low levels of participation among these \nwomen  suggest  that many mothers may not be able to sustainably return to work until children \nare consistently  back in school and access to affordable childcare  programs  becomes available.  \nThe p andemic has also taken a toll on college -educated prime -age women , with \nparticipation among this group remaining almost a percentage point below its pre -pandemic \nlevel. While the majority of pandemic -related job losses have been in occupations  where \nworking from home was not possible, it was also true that work -from -hom e or “teleworkable” \njobs were not pandemic -proof. College -educated women experienced larger employment losses \nand slower recoveries in these teleworkable jobs than their male counterparts .3 Moreover, recent \nsurvey evidence suggests  that among those who were able to keep their jobs during the \npandemic, employees are feeling increasingly burnt out.  This seems to partly reflect a  feeling \n \n3 Tüzemen, Didem, and Thao Tran. “Were Teleworkable Jobs Pandemic Proof?” Economic Bulletin . Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City . Sept . 30, 2020 .  \n\n3 \n that they need to be available to work longer hours in a flexible work arrangement , with burnout \nseeming  to escalate faster among women than among men.4,5 It is concerning that after the \nprogress of recent years  more women in corporate America seem to be considering  downshifting \ntheir career s or leaving the workforce. Not surprisingly, c hildcare responsibilities seem to be the \nmain reason why some mothers , especially those with young children,  have thought about \ndownshifting or leaving  work .  \nThese dynamics have important implications for both women and for the economy as a \nwhole.  Today’s headlines are filled with references to labor shortages and a lack of available \nworkers.  With women showing the largest declines in participation relative to before the crisis,  \nprogress on labor shortages  will certainly depend on bringing women back into the labor force.   \nAt this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium, an important paper by Bart Hobijn and Ayşegül Şahin \ndocumented that a recovery in labor force participation often lags an improvement in the \nunemployment  rate.6 This was apparent in the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, as it took \na prolonged period of a relatively hot labor market to bring many workers into the labor force.  \nSimilarly, it may require a hot labor market to draw women back following the pandemic.    \nAt the individual level, even temporary absences from the labor market can have \npersistent effects on one’s career trajectory and earnings potential.  Today’s depressed labor force \nparticipation could also affect tomorrow’s progress on gender equality in the work force.  We are \nalready seeing how the pandemic has changed  the way w e work , with hybrid work environments \nbecoming the new norm for many college -educated workers. A necdotal e vidence suggests that \ngiven the choice  of working from home and returning to the office , women may be less likely to \nreturn to the office than men. Depending on how the workplace evolves , this d evelopment  could  \nexacerbate existing gender inequality in representation and career opportunities.   \nPreventing this dynamic will be an important consideration for employers as we \ntransition to new ways of working.  And I am hopeful that the insights from today’s seminar will \nhelp to create a more equitable economic environment that offers the tools, resources, and \nopportunities women need to thrive.  \n \n4 Women in the Workplace 2021 .

History has shown that insulating central banks from the inevitable pressure \nof political dynamics is an important aspect of achieving economic stability for a country’s \ncitizens , even as domestic priorities support a variety of different institutional fra meworks and \nstructures.      \nIn my remarks  today, I ’ll focus on central banking in the United States, beginning with \nsome  historical context on the  Federal Reserve’s  governance structure  and institutional mandate . \nI will also describe the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s approach to achieving its mandate, \nincluding some thoughts on the role of f inancial stability  considerations in the setting of \nmonetary policy.1  \n \nThe Governance Structure of the Federal Reserve \nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the United States had already witnessed \ntwo unsuccessful attempts at establishing a central bank , the First Bank of the United States and \nits successor, the Second Bank of the United States . There was intense political debate around \nthe creation of these two banks, as m any Americans were skeptical about  creating such a \npowerful and centralized institution. As a result , neither was able to outlast their initial 20 -year \ncharter .  \nIn the early 1900s, after a series of financial crises, a third effort was launched  to \nestablish a central bank . Two overarching themes emerged during the  deliberations  of structure \nand governance : On one side were those who supported a decentralized structure under the \ncontrol of the private sector; on the other side were those who believed that the system should be \nhighly centralized under government control.   \nEventually , Congress accepted a compromise proposal from President Woodrow Wilson \nto create a central bank with a combined public and private st ructure with those roles filled \nrespectively by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 regional \nFederal Reserve Banks. In this design, t he Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the \nmonetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve,  consists of 12 voting  members: seven \nmembers of the Board of Governors and five Reserve Bank presidents.  This unique \npublic/private structure is designed to provide a full representation of national interests in the \n \n1 I thank Kansas City Fed Research a nd Policy Officer  Huixin Bi for her assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n\n2 \n formulation of m onetary policy , and i t is my view that the Federal Reserve has been well served \nby the diversity of views inherent to its unique structure.   \n \nThe Independence of the Federal Reserve \nI also believe that the Federal Reserve can best achieve its mandates  as an independent \nagency that makes decisions based on the best available evidence and analysis, free of political \ninterference. That is, Congress set s the monetary policy goals for the Federal Reserve, but also \nprovides the central bank independence in achieving  those goals. A careful reading of Federal \nReserve history , however,  will find episodes when the independence of the Federal Reserve was \nundermined and that these  were often periods when government spending was elevated.   \nPressure on the Federal Reserve to implement policy supportive of government spending \ndates back  to the early years of the central bank . During the First and Second World War s, the \nFederal Reserv e assumed a subservient role to the Treasury, and viewed its  primary duty as “the \nfinancing of military requirements and of production for war purposes .”2 The Treasury made \ndecisions on debt management and the interest rate it would pay to investors, and  then the \nFederal Reserve would absorb any public debt that was not purchased by investors at the fixed  \nrate. After World  War II, the Federal Reserve became increasingly uncomfortable with  this \narrangement as inflation started to rise  while interest rates remained fixed at a very low  level .     \nEventually, the Federal Reserve’s resistance to continually supporting government \nspending led to a formal accord with the Treasury in 1951.  The Accord eliminated  the obligation \nof the Fed eral Reserve to monetize the debt of the Treasury at a fixed rate. It did not however \neliminate p olitical pressures on the Federal Reserve to hold rates low . The list of events includes \nsuch high-profile instances as pressure from  President Lyndon Johnson to hold rates low as a \nmeans of supporting his proposals during the Vietnam War and to calls for Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker’s resignation during the Federal Reserve System’s successful, but \npainful, battle against high inflation  in the early 1980s . Nevertheless, the Treasury -Fed Accord  \nbecame essential to the independence of central banking and how monetary policy is pursued by \nthe Federal Reserve today.    \n  \n \n2 See “ The Federal Reserve System: Its purposes and functions ” (1947).  \n\n3 \n The Mandate of the Federal Reserve \nThe Federal Reserve operates  under a directive from the U.S. Congress that is widely \nknown as the Fed’s dual mandate: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and a \nmaximum level of  sustainable employment . The mandate, however, has evolved considerably \nduring the past century.   At its founding in 1913, the Federal Reserve’s central purpose was to “furnish an elastic \ncurrency” and “to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States.”\n3 In the \n1940s, with the Great Depression in mind and the U.S. economy transitioning out of  the \nproduction of wartime goods , Congress passed the Employment Act of 1946, which called for  \nfederal government policy to “ promote maximum employment, production,  and purchasing \npower .”4 \nBy the 1970s, reports of sustained  inflation and high unemployment led to the enactment \nof the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977. It explicitly set price stab ility as a national policy \ngoal and direct ed the Federal Reserve to “maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit \naggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential to increase production, so as to \npromote the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term inter est \nrates.”5   \nIn general, t he Federal Reserve’s dual mandate for maximum employment and price \nstability is complementary. A strong commitment to price stability reduces fluctuations in \neconomic activity  and helps  achieve  maximum employment  and sustainable economic growth in \nthe long run. Occasionally, there are times when the goals are not complementary. For ex ample , \nthe economy saw both high inflation and high unemployment in t he 1970s . Not surprisingly, the \nFed came under intense political pressure during this period as it weighed the balance between \nits inflation and employment mandates .  \n \nThe Recent Federal Reserve’s Framework Review  \nAs economic conditions have changed over time, t he conduct of monetary policy also has \nchanged . Most recently, in  August 2020  the Federal Reserve concluded a monetary policy \n \n3 See “ Federal Reserve Act: Public Law 63 -43, 63rd Congress, H.R. 7837 .” \n4 See “ Employment Act of 1946 .” \n5 See “ Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 .” \n\n4 \n framework  review that was launched prior to the pandemic. The purpose of the review was to re -\nassess how to  conduct monetary policy and achieve its dual mandate  in a low interest rate \nenvironment . \nIn recent years, interest rates have fallen to historically low levels, not just in the United \nStates, but around the world. These lower rates, at least partially, reflect structural changes to the \neconomy, including higher savings by households and businesses in  an aging society.  Low \ninterest rates can pose a constraint on a central bank ’s ability to stabilize the economy during a n \neconomic  downturn.  \nIn addition, the link between the pace of economic activity and inflation appears to have \nweakened. In the years leading up to the pandemic, inflation remained persistently low  even as \nthe unemployment rate neared record lows .  This led some to be concerned that  persistently  low \ninflation  could lead households  and businesses to shift down their inflation expectations , \npotentially setting inflation on a downward spiral  and furthe r constraining policy space for the \nFederal Reserve.  \nIn response to those changes , the Federal Reserve revised  its monetary policy framework \nlast year along  two important dimensions . First, in the absence of signs of sustained upward \npressure on inflation , the FOMC will not tighten its policy stance  in response to low \nunemployment rates  alone . Second, the Committee will aim to target an inflation rate that \naverages  2 percent over time. That is, in the case of inflation falling persistently below 2 percent, \nthe FOMC w ill allow inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for a period of time.   \nIt is important to note that even with these revisions, monetary policy is conduct ed by \nway of a “framework” rather than a “rule .” This is important because the structure o f the \neconomy evolves over time  in ways that can be difficult to anticipate . The flexibility of the \nframework allows the FOMC to adapt to new circumstances and strengthen its credibility.  \nThis is certainly true now, as the United States economy recovers from an unprecedented \nshock.  With extraordinary fiscal support, as well as potential structural changes to the economy \nand labor market s stemming from the pandemic , economic dynamics could evolve  quite \ndifferently  now than in the past.  The Fed is likely to best maintain its credibility by remaining \nnimble and attentive to economic  conditions as we seek to achieve our dual mandate.   \n  \n \n\n5 \n Financial stability  \nEssential to the conduct of monetary policy and the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s \nmandated objectives is a stable financial system .  Prior to the creation of the Federal Res erve, \nU.S. banking panics were a frequent occurrence . To the founders of the Federal Reserve, the \nparamount goal  was to create a monetary system that could respond effectively to stresses in the \nbanking system and serve as lender of last resort in a banking crisis.  \nToday, financial stability isn’t in the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate , unlike the \nexplicit mandate provided to the Central Bank of Chile . However, even without a mandate, it is \nwell understood that financial system risks can impede the attainment of the FOMC ’s objectives \nfor inflation and employment . A prolonged low -rate environment can increase risk appetites and \nraise  asset values. Incorporating financial stability concerns into monetary policy deliberations \ncan help to build a more resilient system  and to better achieve mandated goals . \nIdentifying financial system  risks is clearly important; and difficult, given the constant  \nevolution of the financial system and associated vulnerabilities .  Technological change and \nfinancial innovation introduce new risks that require monitoring . From stablecoins to the risks \nassoci ated with climate change, judging the vulnerabilities that can derail financial stability \nrequires flexibility and nimbleness on the part of central banks . Equally important is \nunderstanding what tools exist to address financial stability  concerns.  Moneta ry policy settings \nare not well suited, in my view,  to be the primary tool for maintaining financial stability, \nalthough the stance of monetary policy clearly has implications for financial stability.  And while \nmacroprudential approaches are desirable in theory, deploying macroprudential policy in a \ntimely and potent  manner , at least in the United States’ experience, has been challenging .  \n \nConclusion \n Even a s economies and financial systems evolve, the case for central bank independence \nis likely to remain strong.  Domestic considerations and priorities will undoubtedly dictate the \ncontext and parameters of independence, but the benefits of separating decisions regarding the \nstance of monetary policy from political considerations are likely to serve the long -term interests \nof governments and their citizens ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \nSeptember 24, 2021  \nAmerican Enterprise Institute  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n Thank you,  Steve , for the invitation to participate in this forum.  I look forward to this \nmorning’s conversation  with your panelists . \nWhen the pandemic took hold and widespread  shutdown s were adopted in the spring of \n2020,  it was immediately apparent that the hit to economic activity would be enormous . Less \ncertain  was ho w long the shock would persist.  Many workplaces sent staff home  with the \nassumption that things would return to normal within a few weeks . Now a year -and-a-half later, \nnormal remains on the horizon.  With the 2020 recession being both the deepest and shortest on \nrecord, the  economy has bounced back sharply, while the return to normal continues to be the \nkey dynamic shaping  the economic outlook.  \nIn discussing the shocks to which the economy is now adjusting , I would include both the \nclosures and disrupt ions associated with the pandemic as well as the enormous fiscal and \nmonetary policy response that followed.  The pandemic shock disrupted the pattern of  \nconsumption  by favoring goods over services . It also disrupted production, introducing frictions \nin labor markets and scrambling global supply chains.  The policy response led to a spike in  \nhousehold savings —as fiscal deficits funded transfer payments —and to a doubling of the Fed’s \nbalance sheet.   \nIn many cases , these shocks —the pandemic and the policy reaction —were offsetting as \nevidenced by the rapid recovery of output and employment.  However, in other cases, the \npandemic and the policy response conspired to  push the economy away from its equilibrium, \ndisrupting long-run trends.  For example, the ratio of goods consumption to services consumption \nis now far above  its long -run historical trend.  Similarly, the household saving rate jumped to an \nall-time high  early in the pandemic, and, although it has come down, rema ins considerably above \nits average in recent decades.  In both these examples, as well as others, i t is reasonable to expect \nthat historical patterns will reemerge, with consequence s for demand, employment, and prices.  \nAs both the pandemic and the policy re sponse fade, the pull toward normal will shape the \noutlook.   \nThat said, while I am comfortable suggesting that the economy  has not returned to \nnormal , I would not be comfortable suggesting that  I know what normal will end up looking like . \n“Normal” is likely to be elusive for some time.  The pandemic was a tremendous disruption  that \nhas affected every aspect of how  and where people work, where they live, and what activities \nthey engage in . Some of the changes coming out of the pandemic will persist  and alter the \n\n2 \n structure of the economy.  Of course, separating transitory from persistent is one of the central \nchallenges of economic policymaking.   \nIt might seem odd to be discussing a return to normal when the Delta variant has pushed \nnew infections  uncomfor tably close to all-time highs . However, m y sense is that , \nnotwithstanding the tragic human toll, the primary effect of the Delta variant will be to prolong \nthe return to normal, rather than upend the process altogether.  \nIn the rem ainder of my time , I would like to discuss some of the key normalization \ndynamics I will be watching in the economy.  Overall, I view these dynamics  as support ing a \ncontinued strong recovery and further gains in employment, while simultaneously relieving some  \n(though not all ) of the price pressures that have elevated inflation in recent months.  I will then \nturn to  the outlook for monetary policy, including some thoughts on what policy normalization \nmight look like, and how the decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) might \nshape that process . \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nOne dynamic  likely to shape the outlook is the reemergence of long -standing patterns of \nconsumption, particularly spending on goods relative to services.  With the onset of the \npandemic, r estrictions and consumer caution led to sharp decline s in the consumption of contact -\nintensive services , such as hotel accommodations , concerts, and restaurants , even as homebound \nconsumers ramped up spending on goods . Though services remain a far larger component of \nconsumption than goods, their relative share has declined.  For example, in the second quarter , \nconsumers purchased $1.80  of services for every $1 of goods, far less than the $2. 20 they spent \non average in the years leading up to the pandemic. Over time as the pandemic’s grip wanes , I \nexpect old patterns to re emerge as audiences return to theaters, conferencegoers resume travel, \nand the Jackson Hole Symposium returns to Jackson Hole , for example . This return to normal \nwill pivot c onsumption back towards services and away from goods.   \n The rotation towards services  consumption  will be important for  further improvements in \nthe labor market.  Service sector jobs, primarily in leisure and hospitality and health, represent the \noverwhelmi ng majority of the over 5 million jobs that have yet to return following the dramatic \nloss of jobs in March and April of last year . I expect a return of services consumption to lead to \nfurther strong job gains, with the caveat that the Delta variant could delay this rebound.     \n\n3 \n A pivot towards services will also take some pressure off the red-hot goods market.  \nStrong demand for durable goods, exacerbated by supply chain difficulties, has been an \nimportant contributor to the overall rise in inflation. Over the past year, durable goods prices \nhave increased 7 percent, the first sustain ed break in an over 20-year trend of declining prices.  \nAutomobiles, both new and used, have been an important part of this increase, but the prices for other goods, such as household appliances and recreational equipment have also moved up \nsharply.  As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pre ssure should ease for \noverstretched goods demand, even as services growth continues to support the overall recovery \nin the economy.  \nAlthough I expect an easing in the demand for goods , and a loosening of bottlenecks , to \nrelieve some of the pres sure on prices,  the data offer a note of caution . In particular, recent \nmonths have seen a rebound in previously depressed services prices even as goods prices remain \nelevated.  For example, prices for hotel accommodations  in the  index of personal consumption \nexpenditures (PCE)  are now  9 percent above pre -pandemic levels, even as spending on hotel \nrooms remains  16 percent below  where it was prior to the pandemic.  Earlier  this year, PCE \ninflation was recording record levels of dispersion across categories  of consumption . For \nexample, in February , categories representing 16 percent of PCE expenditure s were reporting \ninflation far in excess of average, mostly goods, whereas 26 percent of expenditures recorded \nextraordinar ily low inflation, mostly services.\n1 By June, the percent of expenditures with well-\nbelow average inflation had fallen to 5 percent, while 51 percent of expenditures recorded  price \nincreases far above recent  trend . This is to say, that a shift in demand towards services could help \nease inflation pressures, but that a sustained step down in inflation is likely to also require a \nstabilization in services prices.  \nWhy are prices for some services increasing rapidly even as demand remains weak ? \nSpeaking to contacts in my district, a common explanation is th e lack of available labor.  Without \nworkers, supply is curtailed and prices rise.  The labor shortage has developed as over 5 million \nfewer people are employed relative to before the pandemic.  In large part , the current tightness of \nlabor markets reflects a dramatic decline in labor force participation that developed at the start of \nthe pandemic and has shown  little improvement since.  Despite the persistence of the decline in \nlabor force participation, I believe the pandemic shock remains behind a large part of th e decline, \n \n1 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco | PCE Inflation Dispersion (frbsf.org)  \n\n4 \n with a high likelihood of workers returning as pandemic -induced frictions , including concern \nover the safety of returning to work as well as disruptions to childcare arrangements,  continue to \nease.   \nThe pandemic shock has led  many women to leave the labor force, disproportionately  \nwomen of color without college degrees .2 The absence of these workers from the labor force is \ncontributing to labor shortages in some services industries.  Difficulty in obtaining child -care \nlikely explains some of the decline in participation.  Tellingly, employment in daycare centers \nremains 10 percent below pre -pand emic levels, suggesting that capacity in this important \nindustry remains impaired.  As the pandemic fades, a normalization of childcare could bring these \nworkers back into the workforce, supporting growth, increasing employment, and alleviating \nsome of the labor shortages that could be contributing to price increases.   \nAnother dynamic contributing to the fall in labor force participation has been an increase \nin the proportion of the population  reporting being retired.  Interestingly, research by staff at  the \nKansas City Fed has shown that the rise in reported retirement does not reflect an increase in the \ntransition of workers into retirement, but rather a sharp decrease in the typical flow of retirees \nback into the workforce.3 Before  the pandemic, every mont h a substantial number of retirees \nreported returning to work.  It is possible increased health concerns during the pandemic \ndisrupted this flow.  Here again , as the pandemic fades , it might be reasonable for this flow to \nonce again reemerge, adding workers to the labor force and further alleviating worker shortages.    \nAll in all, my expectation is that a return to  historical patterns of consumption, with a \nrenewed emphasis on servic es, and a recovery in labor force participation, with the return of \nchildcare and decreased health concerns , will contribute  to an outlook for continued growth,  \nless-binding constraints , and moderating inflation.   \nThere are risks around this outlook, including the continued presence of the pandemic. \nImportantly, the effects  of the upsurge in new cases  could be as pronounced for  supply as  for \ndemand, prolonging the tightness of the economy and maintaining upward pressure on prices. Renewed concern over the virus could impede the recovery in services consumption such that \ndemand remains directed towards sectors of the economy that are near capacity and away from \n \n2 Women without a College Degree, Especially Minori ty Mothers, Face a Steeper Road to Recovery \n(kansascityfed.org)  \n3 What Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? -  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n5 \n those sectors that have available slack . The surge in the virus could also delay the normalization \nof the labor market, particularly if schooling and childcare are  once again disrupted.  \nAside from the economic threats associated with th e pandemic,  the high level of \nhousehold savings  contributes an additional element of uncertainty to the outlook . Estimates \nsuggest  that the stockpile of household saving s has increased by close to $2.5 trillion.  Of course, \nhealthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and , if the  savings  are spent out \nover time,  this spending could support steady economic growth for some time . However, if \nhouseholds instead choose to spend rapidly, a rush  of demand could keep the economy at \ncapacity, reinfo rcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on prices.  Households \nhave a lot of firepower, and if and how quickly they choose to spend will be an important factor \nin how tight the economy remains.  Of course, whether consumers choose to spend or  save is a \ndecision directly impacted by monetary policy, so the speed at which any excess household \nsaving is spent down is not independent of our policy decisions.   \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nSince last December, t he Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near \nzero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and \ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The \nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until \nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \nIn my view , the criteria for  substantial further progress ha ve been met , with inflation \nrunning well above our target and the unemployment rate at 5.2  percent , down 1½ percentage \npoints relative to December.  Under these conditions, the rationale for continuing to add to our \nasset holdings each month has waned , and signaling  that we will soon consider bringing our  asset \npurchases to an end is appropriate .  \nWhile recent public focus has been on the timeline for tapering asset purchases, the \ncumulative effect of these purchases is arguably the more substantive force acting on the \neconomy. Since March of l ast year, the Federal Reserve has purchased more than $4 trillion of  \nsecurities, pushing our total asset holdings to nearly $8.5 trillion dollars. These asset holdings are depressing longer -term interest rates most relevant for households and businesses an d thereby are \n\n6 \n providing a significant amount of accommodation. And, importantly, this accommodation will \npersist even when tapering is complete.  \nAs the adjustment of our asset purchases get s underway, the focus of attention will \nnaturally shift to the path of the policy rate . The ongoing effects of these asset  purchases , \nalongside  the presence of both upside and downside risks, will complicate the task of judging the \nachievement of criteria for raising rates. One might argue that today’s inflation dynam ics are \nlikely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time and align with the \nCommittee’s threshold criteria. On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment \nare murkier.  \nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment \nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in \nthe current expansion . As I discussed, t he pandemic introduced a number of frictio ns into the \nlabor market.  Barring further intensification of the virus, I would expect these frictions to fade, \npromoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment.  However, I \nam open to the possibility that the pandemic has res ulted in a number of structural changes in  the \nlabor market.  These changes could affect the  assessment of maximum employment in ways that \nare not yet clear.   \n \nPolicy Normalization  \nBeyond interpreting the evolving economic landscape, policymakers also must consider \nthe implications of the multiple policy tools at play as we contemplate removing policy \naccommodation.  While the shift from extraordinary policy accommodation to policy \nnormalization remains some way off, the linkages between balance sheet policies and the path for policy rates  will be factors in future policy deliberations . All else equal, maintaining a la rger \n“normal” balance sheet should imply a higher “normal” terminal policy rate, as higher policy \nrates are needed to offset the stimulative effect of the balance sheet’s continued downward \npressure on longer -term interest rates .  \nGiven the likely trade -offs between the policy rate and the size and composition of the \nbalance sheet as policy shifts towards equilibrium, several factors could affect policymakers’ \ndecisions.  For example, o ne question that might be consider ed is where al ong the yield curve \nwould we prefer the most policy space:  at the long -end or at the short -end?  If the zero lower \n\n7 \n bound is thought to be a costly constraint on policy, there might be an advantage in pushing \ntowards a higher neutral policy rate, arguing for  maintaining a relatively large balance sheet \nweighted towards longer -maturity assets.  The accommodation provided by our balance sheet in \nthis case will have to be offset by higher policy rates, which in turn would provide us with more \nspace to cut rates i n a downturn.  \nWe might also want to consider the rationale for a smaller balance sheet, or at least \nshifting toward one with shorter -maturity assets, with a lower neutral policy rate.  One rationale \nmight be a desire to decrease our footprint in financial markets.  Another is that we might be \nconcerned about the slope of the yield curve.  Raising rates while maintaining a large, long -\nmaturity balance sheet is a recipe for inverting the yield curve, with potential negative effects  for \ntraditional ban king models.  Commentators often discount the effect of an inverted yield curve on \nbanks, arguing that net interest margins are only weakly correlated with bank profitability.  While \nthis might be true for the largest banks , it is not true for small banks.  An inverted yield curve is a \nparticular headwind for community banks, promoting further consolidation in the sector and \nundermining the critical role that community banks provide in terms of local access to credit and \neconomic development.  \nAs the  economy re covers from this pandemic shock, its path is likely to confound our \nassumptions about what a return to normal might look like.  The same is true for the monetary \npolicy normalization process .  Both point to a long and difficult process  ahead as the economy \nheals and the stance of monetary policy  responds ."

Data are the \nvocabulary that policymakers use to build  the narratives that are essential for  making sense of the \neconomy and  for explain ing policy decisions . Data alone cannot tell the story, but the story \ncertainly depends on data.  Consequently, the same data can often underpin widely divergent \neconomic narratives.  As a policymaker, those narratives are shaped not only by an assessment of \nthe data, but also by experiences . Wisdom and the humility to adjust a narrative is essential, \nespecially when  the data make the story increasingly difficult to  tell.  \nToday I would like to look at the data and narratives as they relate to  a particular question \nwith important implications for monetary policy: Is the e conomy tight or slack ? The strength of \ndemand and the ability of supply to meet that demand have been significantly impacted by the \npandemic and the related policy response.  As I talk to contacts in the Kansas City Fed ’s region , I \noften hear anecdotes that suggest an economy that  has run into constraints, including reports of \nthe difficulty in finding workers and of having to pay much higher prices for materials and \ntransportation.  These stories are confirmed by the data, with a record number of unfilled job \nopenings  and sharply higher prices for many commodities.  At the same time, almost 6 million \nfewer individuals are working now relative to before the pandemi c. This suggest s that there \nremains  considerable slack in the labor market .  \nSo, is the economy tight or slack ? Prices are telling in making this assessment.  An \neconomy operating near or at its productive capacity is likely to display higher prices.  On the \nother hand, slack implies under -utilized resources, such that higher demand can be met without \nincreased prices.    \nIn my remarks today, I’ll explore  some of the  factors that are currently contributing to a \ntight economy, which is lifting inflation . While there is good reason to think that many of the \nfactors boosting demand and restraining supply will fade over time , the extraordinary events of \nthe global pandemic make this unfolding narrative a complex one , not the least as the course of \nthe virus r emains uncertain . Importantly, p olicymakers must consider not only near -term but also \nlong-run implications of their policy choices and be prepared to adjust as the economy evolve s.  \n   \n\n2 \n A tight economy \nYou don’t have to look hard to spot signs of an economy that has run into constraints.  \nBusiness surveys are reporting a record number of  job openings . In addition, w orkers are quitting \njobs at a record pace, typically a  sign of a hot  labor  market when alternative opportunities  are \nplentiful.  Not surprisingly , many firms are reporting raising wages or expect ing that they will be \nraising wages  soon.   \nStrong demand and limited supply are  also apparent in depleted inventories.  The \ninventory-to -sales ratio for retailers is at a record low and far below historical norms.  The run -\ndown in inventories has been particularly notable in the automotive sector, where the days ’ \nsupply of available vehicles for sale, at just under 30 days, is less than half its typical level.   \nTight supply and high demand  are behind the recent increase in price inflation.  Prices, as \nmeasured by the consumer price index  (CPI), increased 5.4  percent over the 12 months ending in \nJuly, matching June’s increase and remaining at the fastest pace of increase in over a decade.  To \nbe sure , some of the increase in prices simply  reflects a reversal of price declines recorded earlier \nin the pandemic , particularly  for service categories like airfares and hotels . But the normalization \nof some prices is not the whole story.  Other prices have moved far above pre-pandemic levels.  \nThe sharp increase in car prices has been w idely  reported, not just as it relates to new cars but \nalso used cars and even rental cars.  Indeed, durable goods more generally have experienced large \nincreases  in prices, sometimes at the fastest pace in decades . Outside of consumer prices, there’s \nalso been a sharp rise in commodity prices and transportation costs.  \nBased on this evidence, the economy shows clear signs of tightness.  An important \nquestion is : Will this tightness persist with implications for the path of monetary policy ?  \n \nThe evolution of factors contributing to a tight economy  \nWhether the economy is temporarily tight or more persistently tight will depend on the \nevolution of the dynamics affecting both supply and demand . Currently , demand is exceptionally \nstrong, boosted by expansive fiscal policy and low interest rates.  It is also unbalanced, favoring \nthe consumption of a  subset of goods.  Supply is constrained by frictions in the labor market and \nproduction bottlenecks  resulting from kinks in global supply chains.  \nThere is reason to believe that some of the drivers  boosting demand and constraining \nsupply will fade over time . In particular , I anticipate four factors that could introduc e slack into \n\n3 \n what is now a tight economy.  After discussing these factors, I will turn to a few of the risks \naround this outlook, including the possibility of economic disruptions related to the Delta \nvariant.   \nFirst, notwithstanding the upswing in the virus, I expect to see the continued rotation of \nconsumption from goods to services . More than a year ago , many consumers were forced to \navoid contact -intensive services, such as hotel accommodations , concerts, and amusement parks, \nas well as visits to doctors, dentists, and hair stylists.  Stuck at home, c onsumers rotated their \nconsumption towards goods, often ordered online.  This led to a very uneven pattern of demand.  \nAt the end of the first quarter of this year , services consumption was 5  percent below pre-\npandemic levels , while  the consumption of durable goods was a remarkable 34 percent higher on \nthe same basis.   \nThis unexpected shift in demand towards a subset of  consumption goods has been behind \nsome of the observed tightness in the economy.  For example, purchases of household appliances  \nin the second quarter , including refrigerators and washing machines,  were running 12 percent \nabove the level at the start of 2020 , in part as the pandemic set off a wave of  home  remodeling . \nReports of long delivery delays proliferated  as demand ran up against supply constraints . Not \nsurprisingly,  prices for major household  appliances have surged, increasing 14 percent in the 12 \nmonths to June.   \nWith the advent of widespread vaccination and a lessening of pandemic disruptions \nthrough the spring , services consumption has picked up , and goods consumption has stepped \ndown.  Still, services consumption remain s depressed  relative to previous levels,  suggesting \nfurther room to grow.  As consumption rotates from goods to services, some of the pressure \nshould ease for ove rstretched goods demand, perhaps allowing inventories to rebuild, even as \nservices growth continues to support the overall recovery in the economy.   \nA second factor  is the likelihood that the growth of overall demand will moderate  as \ngovernment supports fade.  The tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus provided to the economy \nsince the start of the pandemic, on the order of $ 6 trillion,  has been essential in supporting \neconomic activity.  However, much of this stimulus has already been distributed,  with the last \nchecks to households going out at the end of March and the Paycheck Protection Program for small business es closing to new applicants at the end of June.  Thus,  the peak boost to growth \nfrom fiscal policy has likely passed . Some estimates show that fiscal policy,  after adding almost \n\n4 \n 4 percentage points to growt h last year,  will subtract about 2 percentage points from growth over \nthe next few years.1 Additional spending bills under consideration could blunt this drag , but \nseem unlikely to fully offset it.   \nA third factor focuses on supply-side considerations contributing to near -term tightness  in \nthe economy.  As it relates to labor supply, temporary factors related to the pandemic are likely \ncontributing to the current tightness in the labor market , importantly  reflect ed in a still-depresse d \nlevel of labor force participation. D isruptions to schooling and daycare led many workers with \nsmall children, primarily non -college educated women, to drop out of the labor force.  Enhanced \nunemployment benefits could also be playing a role, as potential workers  sit on the sidelines and  \nassess their options.    \nAs schools reopen, and enhanced unemployment benefits end, these constrain ts on labor \nsupply should ease.  Already we are seeing promising signs that the labor market is healing.  The \nJuly jo bs report , released last week, showed the unemployment rate dropp ing to 5.4 percent as \nthe economy added close to 1 million jobs.  The labor force participation rate,  however , remained \nalmost 1½ percentage points below its pre -pandemic level, suggesting fur ther room for recovery.    \nFinally, s upply constraints go well beyond labor markets.  A number of materials and \ninputs to production have also experienced  bottlenecks, notably semiconductors and steel , but \nother  aspects of production have been affected as well.  In part, these shortages reflect the \ndifficulties of restarting or reorienting production after a year of sharp shifts in demand.  The \nbottlenecks have also arisen from domino effects related to the tight logistical networks that were \nin place before the pandemic.  With a flexible, dynamic economy, firms can be expected to \novercome most of these bottlenecks through the rest of the year.   \nThis narrative for why the current supply and demand constraints  might be expected to \nease over time strikes me as a reasonable baseline.  My own expectation is that growth will step \ndown but remain robust ; that the labor market will continue to recover at a rapid pace; and  that \ninflation will moderate.  But this narrative would be incomplete without acknowledging the risks \naround these assumptions.  \nOne key risk is the lingering presence of the pandemic.  The upsurge in Covid cases \nrelated to the Delta variant  threatens r enewed restrictions on activity or increased caution on the \npart of consumers and could delay the recovery across many dimensions.  Importantly, the effects \n \n1 See, for example, the  Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure (brookings.edu)  \n\n5 \n could be as pronounced on the supply side as the demand side, prolong ing the tightness of the \neconomy and maintaining upward pressure on prices.  Renewed concern over the virus could \nimpede the recovery in services consumption such that demand remains directed towards sectors \nof the economy that are near capacity and away from those sectors that have available slack . The \nsurge in the virus could als o delay the normalization of the labor market, particularly if schooling \nand childcare is once again disrupted.  The spread of the variant has been particularly disruptive \nin Asia, where vaccination rates remain quite low.  Given Asia’s large imprint in glob al value \nchains, disruptions in the manufacturing sector there can spill over quickly to other parts of the \nworld , further exacerbating production bottlenecks and shortages , and inflation pressure . \nAside from the economic threats associated with the Delta variant, the assumption that \ndemand will moderate may prove otherwise  given the high level of household savings . In \nparticular, a considerabl e portion  of the stimulus transfers to households ha ve been saved , with \nestimates suggest ing that the stockpile of household saving has increased by close to $ 2.5 \ntrillion . Of course, healthy household balance sheets are positive for the economy, and t o the \ndegree that the saving is spent out over time, this could support strong and steady growth for \nsome time.  However, if households instead choose to spend rapidly, a burst of demand could \nkeep  the economy at capacity, reinforcing bottlenecks and putting continued upward pressure on \nprices.  Households have a lot of firepower, and if and how quickl y they choose to spend will be \nan important factor in how tight the economy remains . \n \nThe outlook for m onetary policy  \nWhat does this mean for monetary policy  and the Federal Open Market Committee’s  \nlong-run objectives for the economy ? How should policymakers account for today’s “tight” \ndemand and supply dynamics in their decisions about the path of asset purchases and interest rates?  \nSince last December, t he Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near \nzero until the labor m arket has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and \ninflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The \nFOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities unti l \nsubstantial further progress has been made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \n\n6 \n Without question, the combination of fiscal and monetary policy supports at the onset of \nthe pandemic bridged the economy’s transition from a deep contraction to a robust rebound.  \nNow, with the recovery underway, a transition from extraordinary monetary policy \naccommodation to more neutral settings must follow.  Today’s tight economy as I described \nearlier certainly does not call for a tight monetary policy, but it does signal that the time has \ncome to dial back the settings.  With year -over -year inflation running well over the Committee’s \ntarget and steady progres s in monthly employment gains, the FOMC’s long -run objectives for \nprice stability and employment  are in focus.   \nWhile recognizing that special factors account for much of the current spike in inflation, \nthe expectation of continued strong demand, a recover ing labor market, and firm inflation \nexpectations are consistent, in my view,  with the Committee’s guidance regarding substantial \nfurther progress toward its objectives.  I support bringing asset purchases to an end under these \nconditions.   \nAs this adjustment gets underway, public attention will naturally turn to timing for \nadjusting the policy rate , though it is important to note the timing of the tapering of asset  \npurchases is not mechanically connected to the timing of any policy rate adjustment . With both \nupside and downside risks in play, and multiple policy tools in use, judging the achievement of \ncriteria for raising rates is more complicated.  One might argue that today’s inflation dynamics \nare likely to keep inflation moderately above 2 percen t for some time and align with the \nCommittee’s threshold criteria.  On the other hand, the criteria for judging maximum employment \nare murkier.   \nWhile it is clear that we remain far from the historic low levels of unemployment \nachieved pre-pandemic, it is less clear to me that such a benchmark will be the best guidepost in the current expansion . The pandemic introduced a number of  frictions into the labor market, \nmany of which are likely to evolve over time . Barring further intensification of the virus, I would \nexpect these frictions to fade, promoting strong job gains and a relatively fast approach to maximum employment.  However, the experiences of the past year may well have resulted in a \nnumber of structural changes to the labor market, including how, when, and where people work.  \nThese changes could affect the  assessment of maximum employment in ways that are not yet \nclear.   \n\n7 \n As witnessed during the last expansion, it can take some time to draw individuals back \ninto the labor market.  This is not an argument for keeping rates unchanged but ensuring \naccommodation adjusts as the economy expands, avoiding imbalances  and instability tha t can \nderail such gains.  \nNeedless to say, t he road ahead to policy normalization is likely to be a long and bumpy \none as we navigate inflation and labor market dynamics in the post -pandemic economy . \nConsidering the financial stability landscape also will b e key to the achievement of our goals.  \nAlong the way, a careful assessment of  the data will be essential in shaping the narratives that \nguide policy decisions, balancing nimbleness and patience and steering clear of  policy errors ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n    \n              \nMay 26, 2021 \nOklahoma Bankers Association Annual Conference  \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n  I appreciate the opportunity to attend your annual meeting in person and to extend my \nbest wishes to Roger Beverage as he retires. It has been my pleasure to work with Roger over the \nyears, and his leadership to the banking industry will be missed.   \nFor more than one  year now, our nation has been confronted by a pandemic that has \ntaken a heavy toll. In addition to substantial loss of life and illness, our economy was also challenged in ways that were without comparison in recent history. Now, thanks to the efforts of scien ce and healthcare, it appears we are on a path to return to normalcy.  \nIn my remarks today, I will offer some thoughts on the  economic outlook, as well as the \noutlook for banking.\n1 \n \nThe outlook  \nSince the pandemic upended the global economy a little over a year ago, we have made \nconsiderable progress along the path to economic recovery. By many measures , the gap s that \nopened up in early 2020 have narrowed. Real gross domestic product (GDP), the br oadest \nmeasure of the nation’s economic output, increased at a robust 6½ percent annual rate in the first \nquarter, and will likely surpass its pre -pandemic level this quarter. The unemployment rate , at \njust over 6 percent in April, has improved considerabl y from its nearly 15 percent peak a year \nago.  \nThat progress alone is reason to be optimistic. Even so, we remain more than 8 million \njobs shy relative to pre -pandemic levels.  While t his shortfall partly reflects the  still-elevated \nunemployment rate, anoth er factor has been a decline in labor force participation  with  many \npotential workers  sitting on the sidelines .  \nAs we look ahead, I anticipate strong employment growth in the coming months , \nparticularly in contact- intensive industries such as hospitality and live entertainment, where the \nrebound in jobs has so far been  incomplete.  The outlook is also supported by an  extraordinary \namount of policy stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. Fiscal transfers have led to a considerable improvement in hous ehold balance sheets, with an accumulation of saving s far in excess of \nnormal levels.  In fact, the outlook is so strong that the discussion has quickly shifted from \ndemand shortfalls to supply constraints.  \n \n1 I thank Nick Baker, Stefan Jacewitz, Blake Marsh, and Rajdeep Sengupta of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity for their assistance in preparing thes e remarks.  \n\n2 \n Inflation over the 12 months  ending in April , as measured by the consumer price index  \n(CPI), increased to 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in over a decade and up considerably from the \n1.4 percent pace recorded at the start of the year.  What the current pace of inflation means for the \ninflation outlook for the medium term is less than clear . Many factors that have boosted current \ninflation seem likely to fade over time . All the same, I am not inclined to dismiss today’s pricing \nsignals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judgi ng the outlook for \ninflation. The past few decades saw inflation play a relatively minor role in the day -to-day \ndecision- making of businesses and consumers. Maintaining this  state of affairs as we seek to \nachieve our objectives for maximum employment and price stability  will be important.  \nAs the pace and strength of the recovery unfolds , monetary policy settings remain highly \naccommodative and will remain so for some time in line with the FOMC’s  forward guidance. \nThe Committee has stated that it expects to keep the policy rate near zero until the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its purchases o f Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities until substantial further progress has \nbeen made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \nJudging the appropriate timing for policy adjustments is always challenging. The \neconomy is an incredibly complex se t of relationships, many of which have been disrupted by \nthe pandemic with uncertain long- term consequences. This is true for how we consume, how we \nproduce, and how we work. As the economy works its way towards a new equilibrium, policymakers will be well served to take a flexible approach to monetary policy decisions, in my view. In this regard, the Federal Reserve’s revised framework for monetary policy, adopted last August, provides a “framework,” rather than a “rule.” The  FOMC has in the past avoided s trict \nadherence to monetary policy rules, so it is unsurprising that the revised framework is not a precise prescription for policy action even as it repositions the Federal Reserve’s approach to achieving its congressional mandates for employment and inflation.  \nThe structure of the economy changes over time, and it will be important to adapt to new \ncircumstances rather than adhere to a rigid formulation of policy reactions.  With a tremendous \namount of fiscal stimulus flowing through the economy, the lands cape could unfold quite \ndifferently than the one that shaped the thinking around the revised monetary policy framework. That suggests remaining nimble and attentive to these dynamics will be important as we seek to \n\n3 \n achieve our policy objectives in the cont ext of sustainable economic growth and the well -being \nof the American public.   \n \nThe r ole of banks in the r ecovery   \n The banking industry has of course also played a key role in the recovery to date . Banks \nwere vital  in keeping the economy going in the early days of the pandemic . As investors fled to \nthe safety of cash and other liquid assets, financial markets witnessed a liquidity squeeze that \nwas particularly acute in short -term funding markets. Banks were well sit uated to withstand this \nliquidity squeeze.2 Crucially, the ir resilienc e reflected strong liquidity and capital positions  and \nmassive economic support from the government . As a result, banks were not only able to \nprovision for anticipated losses from the p andemic, but also to continue lending during the early \ndays of the pandemic. B anks provided around $ 270 billion in withdrawals on existing lines of \ncredit t o businesses in the first quarter of 2020 to cover anticipated revenue shortfalls.3  \nWhile the initial pandemic policy response of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve \naddressed the liquidity squeeze in March 2020, subsequent policy actions have pivoted from containing a potential financial crisis to addressing the challenges of supplying new credit to the businesses and households hardest hit by the pandemic. Banks have been a critical conduit for these policy measures. Most notably, banks disbursed funds to small businesses that were hard \nhit by the pandemic  through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP ). As of May 2, 2021, over \n5,000 lenders have approved close to 11 million loans under the PPP, totaling $780 billion in \nfunds to eligible small and medium- sized businesses .\n4 Regional and community banks have been \nparticularly active participants in the program. PPP loans ma ke up more than a quarter of \noutstanding C&I loans at  regional banks and around 40 percent at community banks —\nsignificantly more than large banking organizations ( LBOs ). This is a massive program , and its \nability to reach critical corners of the economy has depended on the strength of the relationships \nthat community and regional banks built over years of work with small, local businesses in their communities.  \n \n2 Rajdeep Sengupta and Fei Xue, 2020. \" The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks ,\" Economic Bulletin, \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 11, 2020.  \n3 The data reported are end -of-quarter changes in unused commitments for banks between Q4:2019 and Q1:2020. \nAnecdotal evidence would suggest that most of the draws occurred late in the first  quarter of 2020.  \n4 https://www.sba.gov/funding -programs/loans/covid -19-relief -options/paycheck -protection -program/ppp- data  \n\n4 \n The sheer size of the economic policy  response to the pandemic, however, has created \ncertain challenges for banks. B ank deposits have increased dramatically . At the same time , fiscal \ntransfers have weighed on loan demand. While small businesses have obtained much -needed \nfunding through the PP P program, most large corporate firms have been able to take advantage \nof easing credit conditions in bond financing. Federal aid packages have helped households \nrepay debt, boost savings and improve credit scores —complementing a decade- long cycle of \ndelev eraging by households from the peak of the 2008 f inancial crisis. As a result of this rapid \nand broad turnaround in credit conditions, demand for more credit , especially for bank loans , has \nbeen reduced. Facing low loan demand, banks have us ed much of their increased deposit funding \nto acquire low -yielding, liquid securities , which has weigh ed on overall bank profitability.  \n As the recovery from the pandemic continues, loan demand is lik ely to increase,  and \nbanks will find new lending opportunities. Indeed, demand for auto lending, for example , has \npicked up recently. However, t otal loan growth —and particularly business lending growth \noutside the PPP program —remains  tepid despite bank standards easing as economic uncertainty \nhas abated. Pressure to raise profitability could increase.  \n \nImplications for r isk-taking and b ank c apital  \nEven if loan volumes do pick up appreciably, profitability is likely to remain a concern. \nWith interest rates expected to remain low for some time, profitability measures , such as net \ninterest margins , will continue to be compressed.  The pressure t o boost profitability can result in \nturning to other , possibly riskier,  alternatives to bolster returns .  \nThe link between profitability and risk- taking is not always clear cut , but the  search for \nhigher returns  can understandably have negative consequences  for the banking system and the \neconomy more broadly. Some r esearch  argues that wh en a bank’s incentives are well aligned, \npreserving value can limit risk -taking .5 Such incentives may come under pressure in today’s \nenvironment where l ower profitability might encourage risk- taking, whether by increasing \n \n5 Demsetz, Rebecca, Mark R. Saidenberg, and Philip  E. Strahan, 1996, “ Banks with Something to Lose: The \nDisciplinary Role of the Franchise Value ,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, 2(2), 1-\n14; among others . \n\n5 \n duration in asset portfolios, by loosening underwriting standards to compete for loans, or by \nexpanding into new or riskier lines of business.  \nDespite loan demand uncertainties, bank earnings during the firs t quarter of this year \nhave been positive, benefitting in large part from the release of loan loss reserves , particularly for \nlarger banks . Banks also have become  more reliant on non- interest income  sources. However, \nrecent events around Archegos Capital and Greensill Capital  are reminders of the impact of \nidiosyncratic losses and the ongoing value of risk management and strong capital. Both opaque, complex transactions  or those with seemingly  well -understood risks  can lead to unex pected \nlosses.  \nRegulatory reforms enhanced capital rules in response to the 2008 f inancial c risis, in part  \nto protect against risks that are not well understood . These rules strengthened requirements for \nthe amount and quality of capital in systemically significant banks and undoubtedly contributed \nto stab ility in the banking industry as the global pandemic  unfolded. Our largest banks, those \nlabeled GSIBs  (global  systemically important banks) entered the pandemic with capital  levels \nwell above those leading into the last crisis . However, in terms of leverage ratios, c ommunity \nand regional banks continue to hold even more  capital  than GSIBs .\n6 \nThe fundamentals of s trong capital and robust risk management will remain important as \nthe economic recovery advances  and banks resume dividend payments and share repurchases . \nResisting an excessive focus on short -term results at the expense of long -term interests  will be \nkey.7 The full effect of the pandemic on bank portfolios  is still unknown, and with so much \nuncertain , there are benefits to a longer -term view of capital.  \nA shifting f inancial s ector  landscape  \n Even as the banking industry manages through the aftermath of the pandemic, banks also \nare responding to strategic shifts in  the broader financial sector landscape.  The nation’s banking \nsystem across all sizes —large, small, and regional —ha s historically been the driver of financial \nservices for consumers and businesses.  However, technology and innovation also have a long \n \n6 The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s semi -annual updates on Bank Capital Analysis (BCA)  judges capital \nstrength across the banking industry. As of December 31 , 2020, the aggregate Tier 1 leverage ratios for global \nsystemically import ant banks (GSIBs) was 7. 5 compared to 9.1 for RBOs  and 10.0 for CBOs . \n7 For definitions of short -termism , see Sheila Bair, “Lessons of the Financial Crisis: The Dangers of Short -\nTermism,” Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance & Financial Regulation, Monday, July 4, 2011 , or  \nhttps://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/issues/short -termism . \n\n6 \n history of joining forces to disrupt existing conventions.  Similar to the proliferation of nonbank \nlenders, we now see thi s dynamic playing out in today’s financial system as it relates to \nfacilitating payments.  In essence, the unbundling of traditional banking services  poses new \nquestions for a legal and regulatory framework that has positioned the banking system to support \nmonetary policy transmission, financial stability and consumer protections . \nThe ability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email is appealing and \nunderstandably gaining rapid adoption. Indeed, we’ve witnessed over the past year an increased  \nadoption of digital payments. Yet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments faster, less costly, and broadly accessible, nonbank entrants into financial services operate largely outside our existing institutional and regulatory frameworks. In some cases, novel charters at the \nstate and federal level have emerged to conduct these activities with new forms of money  and \ncustomized regulatory frameworks . \nTo what extent our existing legal and regulatory frameworks will need to evolve is \nunclear. The characteristics associated with commercial banks have generally assumed access to the public safety net of federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve’s discount window  \nwith a state/federal regulatory framework and direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails.\n8 State and federal regulators collectively should consider how these fintechs and payment \nplatforms fit into the banking system.   \nToday’s accelerating pace of  technological  change has implications for our financial \nsystem.  But what hasn’t changed are the Federal Reserve’s priorities for the payment system : \nsafety, accessibility and efficiency.  It is through this lens that the Federal  Reserve remains \ncommitted to its goal to deliver its  first new payment service in over 40 years, the FedNow \nService.  The FedNow Service is a high priority for the Federal Reserve and will lay a foundation \nfor the future of payments that can be used as a s pringboard for innovation and yield important \neconomic benefits for the public. We are taking a phased approach in developing the FedNow Service so we can bring initial releases to market as quickly as possible, while providing flexibility to add key featu res in future releases.  We continue to collaborate with the industry and \nhave established a FedNow Community for those interested in helping evolve the development \n \n8 On May 5, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board invited comment on proposed guidelines to evaluate requests for \naccounts and payments services at Federal Reserve Banks: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210505a.htm .  \n\n7 \n of the FedNow Service. If you aren’t already a member and would like to join, you can visit the \nFRBservices.org website9 for more information.  \nNew entrants and new business models will continue to disrupt and reshape the financial \nservices industry.  Bank strategies for the future are taking a fresh look at providing payments \nservices, including innovation through new services, such as FedNow, or new partnerships with \nfintechs and other financial services providers.  Your customers’ changing needs and preferences \nwill be key  to the strategies you pursue, as they have been for decades.  \n \n \n9 https://www.frbservices.org/financial -services/fednow/community/index.html"

Now in its 11th year, the symposium offers an opportunity for academics, \npolicymakers, lenders and  practitioners  to gather and discuss important topics related to \nagricultural economics.  We are proud to sponsor this look at a sector so vital to our region, the \nnation and the global  economy and to engage with you in this virtual format .  \nThis year’s theme  focuses on agricultural productivity growth . Produc ers and consumers \nof agricultural products alike benefit from p roductivity growth , and it has particular relevance \nnow as strong increases in demand for agricultural products coincide with a run- up in crop \nprices.  Over the long run, productivity growth is a key determin ant in whether  increased demand \nwill be met by higher supply or  if prices will have to rise  to dampen  the strength of demand.  \nThe importance of productivity growth extends well  beyond agriculture , of course . It \nplays an essential role in the long -run pace of economic growth, as well as the living standards \nand incomes of households. P roductivity growth also lies at the intersection of demand growth \nand price inflation—a relationship  that is attracting quite a bit of attention these days . In my \nremarks this afternoon, I’ll talk about the  role of productivity growth as a consideration for the \nnation’s economic outlook, and consequently, the outlook for monetary policy.  \n \nThe e conomic outlook  \nSince the pandemic upended the global economy a little over a year ago, we have made \nconsiderable progress along the path to economic recovery. By many measures , the gap s that \nopened up in early 2020 have narrowed. Real gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest \nmeasure of the nation’s economic output, increased at a robust 6½ percent annual rate in the first \nquarter, and will likely surpass its pre -pandemic level this quarter. The unemployment rate , at \njust over 6 percent in April, has improved considerably from its nearly 15 percent peak a year \nago.  \nThat progress alone is reason to be optimistic . Even so, we remain more than 8 million \njobs shy relative to pre -pandemic levels.  While t his shortfall partly reflects the  still-elevated \nunem ployment rate, another factor has been a decline in labor force participation  with  many \npotential workers  sitting on the sidelines .  \nAs we look ahead, I anticipate strong employment growth in the coming months , \nparticularly in contact -intensive industries such as hospitality and live entertainment, where the \n\n2 \n rebound in jobs has so far been  incomplete.  The outlook is also supported by an  extraordinary \namount of policy stimulus, both fiscal and monetary. Fiscal transfers have led to a considerable \nimprovement in household balance sheets, with an accumulation of savings  far in excess of \nnormal levels.  In fact, the outlook is so strong that the discussion has quickly shifted from \ndemand shortfalls to supply constraints.  \n \nKey questio ns for the outlook  \nIn gauging the economy’s progress , I see three big, and somewhat sequential, questions \nthat policymakers will grapple with over coming months . First, how actively will consumers \nspend down the  excess saving s that many households accumulated during the pandemic ? \nSecond, will limited supply  and bottlenecks constrain this urge to spend, or will production, \npossibly supported by productivity growth, be able to keep up with a rush in demand ? And third, \nif strong demand runs up against  production constraints, will the effect be a temporary increase \nin prices and inflation, or a more persistent change in price- setting behavior  of businesses?   \nStarting with the outlook for household spending, healthy balance sheets suggest that \nhouseholds have the capacity to spend . If and how quickly households spend down their excess \nsavings will likely be an important determin ant of  the pace of growth over the next few years . \nWhile households could draw down their savings quickly, several factors suggest that people \nmay want to hang on to at least a portion of their accumulated  savings.  Households are now \npainfully aware of new economic risks that might not have been a consider ation a little over a \nyear ago. With this recent experience of an economic shutdown, they may wish to keep higher \namounts of  liquid assets relative to the past.  Also, since the fiscal transfers have largely been \ntemporary, consumers might not want to mater ially change their spending decisions  in response \nto only a short -lived  increase in income.  \nOn the second question, w ill supply constraints impede growth? We are certainly hearing \nanecdotal evidence to this effect, with labor, materials and transportation  services reported as \nbeing in short supply. For  labor, this shortage reflects  the still -depressed level of labor force \nparticipation that I discussed earlier.  How quickly supply can grow to meet higher demand will \nlikely, at least in part, depend on the factors that are behind the decline in  labor force \nparticipation.  Some of the fall  is likely due to the pandemic, either through restrictions on \nactivity, lack of child care, enhanced unemployment benefits, or fear of contagion. As the \n\n3 \n pandemic fades  and time passes, these factors will reverse, and labor constraints should ease.  \nHowever, it is also possible that some of the decline in participation reflects a growi ng \ndetachment from work for some, especially after the disruptions of the last year. T his might be \nparticularly true for workers that were near retirement.  In this case, it will likely take a period of \nstrong growth to draw these workers back in.  \nWith res pect to the widespread materials and transportation shortages, some may resolve \nduring the remainder of the year , but others are likely to persist beyond that. For example, the \nshift in demand from services to goods during the pandemic has led to a surge i n imports, \nbacking up traffic at U.S. ports. The resulting longer shipping times have led to a global shortage \nof intermodal containers that many in the agricultural industry have likely experienced. A shift in consumption patterns back to services may hel p alleviate these delays, but it’s not yet clear when \nthat may occur. For manufacturers, surging demand for commodity computer chips has run up against global capacity constraints, which require long lead times to expand. \nProductivity growth has the potential to  play a role in meeting any incipient  rush in \ndemand. By allowing higher output with the same inputs, productivity can loosen the capacity \nand labor constraints that could stifle demand and weigh on economic growth.   \nPredicting the evolution of  productivity, however , can be difficult.  Measured by output \nper hour of work, productivity jumped during the pandemic, averaging close to 4 percent at an \nannual rate  over the past year , more than triple  the average pace over the last decade. However, \nmuch of this acceleration  seems likely to reverse as restaurants reopen and hotels return to full \ncapacity given their relatively low measured productivity.    \nBut i t is also possible that certain adaptations made  during the pandemic, as well as \nbehavioral changes on the part of consumers, could lead to a persistent increase in worker \nproductivity. For example, over the past year , restaurants saw their customers shift towards \ncurbside pickup or home delivery options . By adapting to this shift, restaurants were able to \nproduc e a similar product with less labor input.  Similarly, the pandemic has led organizations to \nrethink the role of business travel in their operations. Travel is an expensive input for many business es, and a shift towards far cheaper digital interactions could lead to significant cost \nsavings and increased productivity. On the other hand, one could argue that hosting a conference \nlike this on Zoom is a poor substitute for in -person engagement and cou ld perhaps even depress \nproductivity. This is all to say, that a lot remains to be sorted out regarding the pandemic’s effect \n\n4 \n on productivity. More generally, tight labor markets often incentivize productivity- enhancing \ninnovation. For example, you see thi s at retail stores, where self- checkout has become \nincreasingly common.      \nTurning to the third question, how will the dynamics of a strong economy and supply \nconstraints  affect inflation?   Inflation over the 12 months  ending in April , as measured by the \nconsumer price index  (CPI), increased to 4.2 percent, the fastest pace in over a decade and up \nconsiderably from the 1.4 percent pace recorded at the start of the year.  What the  current pace of \ninflation means for the inflation outlook for the medium  term is less than clear . Many factors that \nhave boosted current inflation seem likely to fade over time . For example, the average price of a \ngallon of gasoline fell to $1.87 last April as demand fell sharply and inventories accumulated \nrapidly . Remarkably, these factors actually pushed t he spot price of oil below zero for a moment \nlast year . This April, as de mand has recovered  with a reopening economy, the average price per \ngallon hit $2.96, an almost 60 percent increase from a year earlier, but about  equal to the average \nprice over the previous  10 years.  This normalization in the price of gasoline contributed almost a  \npercentage point to the overall rate of inflation in April.  \nGasoline of course is not the only price bouncing back as the economy reopens. Some \nservices that suffered large price declines early in t he pandemic, including air travel and hotel \naccommodations, saw prices jump in  April, even as they remain  considerably below pre -\npandemic levels . As these sectors recover, there is certainly scope for further strong increases , \nalthough I would expect  as these prices recover , the pace of increase will slow.   \nA normalization of prices depressed by the pandemic  doesn’t tell the whole story though. \nOther sectors have seen prices jump far above pre- pandemic levels as supply constraints have \ndeveloped against a backdrop of robust demand. This is particularly true  for automobiles, where \nproduction disruptions have contributed to higher new car prices, with even larger spillovers to used car and rental car prices.  In fact, as  many recent  travelers  have experienced , rental car \nprices have increased more than 80 percent over the last year in the CPI data.  Such bottlenecks \nseem likely to clear over time  and stabilize price s.  \nExpecting these price pressures to ease, howeve r, does not ignore the potential for more \npersistent inflation pressures.  Over the long- term, the outlook for inflation is  influenced by \ndemand that is sufficiently strong across a wide range of  goods  and services that it pushes the \noverall economy up against its productive capacity.  In the near -term, it can be difficult to \n\n5 \n distinguish between a string  of seemingly idiosyncratic bottlenecks  and a broader -based lack of \ncapacity.  In the end, the persistence of any step up in inflation will ultimately depend on the \npricing behavior of firms and workers, which in turn will be importantly affected by expectations \nfor future inflation.  \nMeasures of inflation expectations , both from surveys and financial markets,  have move d \nup as the economy has reopened and strong fiscal stimulus has boosted growth. These and other indicators of pricing behavior will provide important signals about  the longer -run trajectory for \ninflation.  Prior to the pandemic, the economy had experienced a long period during whi ch \ninflation pressures remained muted even as the economy appeared to be running near capacity. The apparent lesson from this period was that the inflation process had changed relative to earlier decades, a shift that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOM C) acknowledged in the  adoption \nof its new monetary policy framework last year.  Although providing the context for the revised \nframework, the cause of this shift in inflation dynamics remains relatively obscure.  As such, an \noverarching takeaway  from this p eriod might be that the inflation process can change, and that \nchanges can be relatively persistent.               \nWhile it is clear that several temporary factors are boosting inflation now, I am not \ninclined to dismiss today’s pricing signals or to be overly reliant on historical relationships and \ndynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.  The past few decades saw inflation  play a \nrelatively minor role in the day -to-day decision- making of businesses and consumers.  \nMaintaining this state of affairs  as we seek to achieve our objectives for maximum employment \nand price stability  will be important.   \n \nThe outlook for m onetary p olicy  \nAs the pace and strength of the recovery unfolds , monetary policy settings remain highly \naccommodative and will remain so for some time in line with the FOMC’s  forward guidance. \nThe Committee has stated that it expects to keep th e policy rate near zero until the labor market \nhas reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage -backed securities until substantial further progress has \nbeen made towards these employment and inflation goals.   \n\n6 \n Judging the appropriate timing for policy adjustments is always challenging. The \neconomy is an incredibly complex set of re lationships, many of which have been disrupted by \nthe pandemic with uncertain long- term consequences. This is true for how we consume, how we \nproduce, and how we work. As the economy works its way towards a new equilibrium, \npolicymakers will be well served  to take a flexible approach to monetary policy decisions, in my \nview. In this regard, the Federal Reserve’s revised framework for monetary policy, adopted last August, provides a “framework,” rather than a “rule.” The  FOMC has in the past avoided strict \nadherence to monetary policy rules, so it is unsurprising that the revised framework is not a \nprecise prescription for policy action even as it repositions the Federal Reserve’s approach to achieving its congressional mandates for employment and inflation.  \nThe structure of the economy changes over time, and it will be important to adapt to new \ncircumstances rather than adhere to a rigid formulation of policy reactions.  With a tremendous \namount of fiscal stimulus  flowing through the economy, the landscape could unfold quite \ndifferently  than the one that shaped the thinking around the revised monetary policy framework. \nThat suggests remaining nimble and attentive to these dynamics will be important as we seek to achieve our policy objectives in the context of sustainable economic growth and the well -being \nof the American public ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n          \n              \n   \nApril 13, 2021 \nRacism and the Economy: Focus on the Economics Profession  \nAn Online Series Hosted by the 12 Federal Reserve Banks  \n \n\n 1  Hello and welcome to today’s Rac ism and the Economy series, presented by the 12 \nregional Federal Reserve  Banks. I’m Esther George, president  and CEO of the Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City.  \n This landmark series focuses on ine quality  in our society and examines ways in which \nstructural  racism manifests in our economy. T oday’s event is the fifth in th is series , and it is \nfocused on the economics profession.  The discussion will consider racism and the pipeline into \nthe field of economics, racism and the practice of economics, and promoting inclusivity and \neffecting change.   \n The economics profession has  widely  acknowledged that it has a problem with diversity \nin its ranks . Last year, t he American Economi c Association  hosted a panel titled , “How Can \nEconomics Solve Its Race Problem?” During the session, panelists cited “poor leadership, institutional dysfunctions, discouragement from specializing in the study of race, and a toxic \nprofessional culture.”\n1 Such issues would be a problem in any profession, but it is a particular \nproblem in economics , where the field informs policy judgments with wide -ranging effects on \nthe American public’s well- being.   \n The Federal Reserve System is a large employer of economists in the United States  and \nplays a unique role in shaping the field . Economists contribut e to all aspects of our mission \nincluding monetary policy, supervision and regulation, and payments. In service to that mission, \nwe have a strong interest in shifting our workforce and the economics profession as a whole \ntowards racial inclusion. Addressing today’s economic dynamics is a complex task. It will serve us well to invite new perspectives and new questions about old issues  to challeng e dominant \nparadigms , groupthink, and blind spots . And as a public institution, the Federal Reserve’s \ncredibility depends on the expression of diversity of thought, background, and race. With so \nmuch  influence over the economy and people’s day- to-day lives, the entire population must see \nthemselves reflected in the Fed.  \n As one of the regional R eserve B ank p resident s, my own perspectives on race and the \neconomics profession are shaped not as a member of the economics profession but as a central \nbanker and policymaker whose views rely on input from those trained as economists. I am a \nstrong proponent of a syste m specifically designed to elicit a geographically diverse set of views \n \n1 https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/01/07/793855832/economics -still-has-a-diversity -problem   \n \n\n 2 on the state of the economy and the proper stance of monetary policy. It has been my experience \nworking with in this decentralized System for nearly 40 years that policymaking is improved \nwhen diverse views are represented and assumptions are questioned. With that backdrop, I’ll \noffer a few of my own thoughts on how I view my role, as a policymaker and an employe r, in \nmaking diversity a reality.   First, it begins with me —not  because I  can solve every problem in every place, but \nwhatever I can do, I should do. I am accountable for actions within my sphere of influence , and \nfor the results in my own organization, including its culture, its hiring philosophy, and its public \nengagement . \n Inclusivity must be e mbedded into the values of the institution, to the point of being part \nof its identity. This starts with broad policies and a statement of values, both of which are in \nplace at my Bank and throughout the Federal Reserve System . But progress requires continuous \nadvocacy and monitoring by l eaders, including the use of employee surveys, exit interviews, and \ntracking and reporting metrics. Importantly, t he value of inc lusivity must be part of everyone’s \njob. I t is how we do business.     \n Second, i nclusivity must be reflected in hiring . This requires looking at the broade st \npossible  applicant pool  and holding leaders accountable for doing so. For example, the  Federal \nReserve’s  FedEconJobs.org website  casts a wider net for potential applicants . As we hire, we \nmust ensure that the education and experience filters that we use are set to promote inclusivity.  \nThe Fed can also play a role in encouraging students, even prior to college, that economics is a \nrelevant and attractive career path. This requires outreach and active engagement often to overcome general misperceptions about the field that can discourage stude nts from pursuing an \neducation in economics. My colleague at the San Francisco Fed, Mary Daly, has often pointed \nout that how we describe the profession’s aims and the scope of the questions it can help us \nanswer is key.  \n Finally, w hen w e are in a position to provide opportunities , it is essential that we pursue \ninclusivity in the allocation of those opportunities . For example, the Kansas City Fed host s a \nnumber of conferences and events, including the annual E conomic P olicy Symposium in Jackson \nHole , Wyoming. As we consider the speakers  and other participants for such programs , it is our \njob as the organizer to invite diversity, including bringing more women and people of color into the room. Doing so actively expand s the diversity of our network of co ntacts  and improve s the \n\n 3 quality of the program . This, in turn, can help expand the diversity of information we collect in \nregular economic intelligence gathering, the diversity of participants on our boards and advisory \ncounci ls, and ultimately, a fuller u nderstanding of the economy we seek to promote .    \n I look forward to learning from others how to effect the change we need . It is my hope \nthat every economist and indeed every stakeholder in the economics profession will take what \nwe learn and commit to a set of actions that will make diversity in the field of economics a \nreality.   \n Today’s program will consist of three panel discussions, followed by a discussion with \nthree of my Federal Reserve Bank president colleagues and clos ing remarks  by Raphael Bostic \nof the Atlanta Fed. I’m honored to join my Federal Reserve colleagues as sponsors of this \nimportant series, as well as th e other distinguished panelists for this particular topic.  \n I encourage you to continue these conversations beyond today’s virtual  experience. \nHundreds of today’s attendees have pledged to be a conversation leader and organize  further \ndiscussions within th eir institutions and throughout their communities  on this important topic . \nThese simple actions can bring greater awareness to issues of  structural racism in America’s \neconomy, and by doing so, serve as a catalyst for change.   \n With that, I’ll turn it over to Jeanna Smialek from The New York Times , who will \nmoderate our first panel ."

I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak with you and look forward to our discussion. Agriculture is a particularly important \nsector for the region I serve.  Today, I will share  my observations  on the agricultural economy \nalong with the national economic outlook, concluding with  some thoughts on monetary policy. \nAs always, my views are wholly my own. \nThe pandemic continues to set the course for the economy, as it has for almost a year \nnow. As the pandemic unfolded and intensified last spring, contacts across  our seven- state region \npainted a very bleak picture for the state of agriculture. The prices of major ag commodities fell sharply between February and April. A dramatic decline in travel and gasoline consumption cut \ndemand for U.S. ethanol in half, weighi ng on corn prices. At  meatpacking plants , COVID- 19 \noutbreaks  caused temporary closures at numerous facilities across the country, disrupting supply \nchains and putting producers in a seemingly no- win situation with animals ready to be sold. In \naddition, the  closure of restaurants and food service establishments led to an unprecedented shift \nin consumer buying behavior, adding further pressure to an already- stressed food supply chain.  \nAs economies around the world gradually began to reopen during the summer months, \nand supply chains began to adapt and recover, economic conditions in agriculture also began to improve. Supported by robust demand from China, corn and soybean prices returned to their pre -\npandemic level as the harvest began. Aided by substantial support from various government programs, we began to hear  renewed optimism in the farming community through harvest and \nheading into winter.  \nBy the end of the year, businesses connected to agriculture reported a surge in sales \nactivity as crop  prices rebounded to their highest mark since 2013. And, while some industries , \nparticularly livestock,  remain under pressure due to drought, higher input costs and persistent \n\n2 \n uncertainties —to name just a few —the outlook for agriculture in large parts of t he country has \nimproved dramatically. For the first time since the agricultural downturn began several years \nago, ag lenders have reported stronger loan repayments  and improved liquidity with prospects for \nan increase in land values this year.  \nWhile these recent improvements  are encouraging , risks to the outlook remain . Many of \nthose risks and uncertainties are tied to the national economic outlook.  \nA surge in the virus towards the end of last year  left a noticeable impact , slowing \nconsumption and stalling the recovery in the  labor market. It is encouraging that this latest wave \nof cases  appears to have crested and that the pa ce of vaccination has accelerated . But it also \nremains clear that we are not out of the woods yet , with the risk  that infections could pick up \nonce again , perhaps aided by new variants of the virus . This is just to say that the virus remains \nin the driver’s seat. Economic policy can help mitigate the economic effects of the virus, but i t is \nalmost impos sible  to imagine a full economic recovery until the virus no longer impinges  on the \nday-to-day decision making of households  and business es. \nThe continued drag  of the virus is m ost apparent in the labor market , where we remain \nabout 10 million jobs short relative to before the pandemic. About a third of those missing jobs \nare in the high- contact leisure and hospitality sector , and are unlikely to return in strength until \nthe virus fades. While the unemployment rate has continued to edge down, falling to 6.3 percent \nin January from  almost 15 percent in April  last year , this number likely underestimates the \namount of slack in the labor market . In particular, the labor for ce participation rate remains about \n2 percentage points  below its pre -pandemic level, suggesting many workers, having lost their \njobs, have dropped out of the labor force, or are at least sitting on the sidelines . This is \n\n3 \n particularly true for women, with disruptions in child care likely leadi ng to many difficult \nchoices and lower participation  in the labor market .  \nThough we remain shor t of where we would like to be , the s tage is set for a strong \nrecovery  once widespread vaccination is achieved. T he strength and timing of this bounce  back \nis contingent in my view on three uncertain factors : first, the pace and effectiveness of \nvaccination ; second, the outlook for further fiscal stimulus ; and third, whether  and to what \ndegree households run down the savings that  they have accumulated so far  through the crisis .  \nStarting wit h the first of these factors , once the virus is suppressed, I expect a strong \nrebound in demand for many of the most afflicted sectors, including travel, live entertainment , \nand of particular importance to the agricultural sector, restaurants . In addition, the normalization \nof child care arrangements could allow for the quick return of  some currently sidelined workers. \nThe faster and more effective the vaccination program, the greater  the prospects for a faster and \nstronger economic recovery.    \nTurning to the second factor , fiscal support has been essential  for maintaining  economic \nactivity through the pandemic . The Paycheck Protection Program has provided significant \nsupport to small businesses, allowing many to avoid the cost and disruption of bankruptcy or \nclosure . Transfer payments to households and enhanced unemployment benefits have supported \nconsumer spending, especially  at businesses  relatively insulated from the direct effects of the \npandemic.  With the economy still in the grip of the pandemic, previously enacted f iscal measures \ncontinue to play an important role in supporting growth. F urther fiscal stimulus, as is currently \nbeing di scussed, would undoubtedly accelerate growth. However, by exactly how much is \nuncertain. The package being discussed is heavily weighted towards transfer payments, to \n\n4 \n households and state and local governments. Similar to the previous rounds of fiscal support, a \nsubstantial portion of these transfers could be saved rather than spent  immediately .  \nWhich brings me to the third factor  likely to determine the speed and strength of the \nrecovery : how households, in the aggregate, treat the excess saving that they have accumulated \nduring the pandemic. Partly as a consequence of restrictions on activity , but mostly on account of \nlarge fiscal transfers, the personal saving rate shot up to a record high in the second quarter. Though it has since fallen back, the saving rate remains about twice as high as it was prior to the pandemic. All told , it has been estimated that over the past year households have increased their \nsavings  (or paid down their debt)  by about $1.5 trillion relative to normal levels. A consequence \nof this accumulation makes aggregate household balance sheets  look stronger, even as it masks \nthat many  individual households find themselves  in a difficult financial position .  \nThis improvement in household finances, which is atypical coming out of a recession, \nputs households in a strong position to resume spending once the pandemic is in the rearview \nmirror. This is especially true if the r un up in saving reflected an inability to consume due to \npandemic- related restrictions. H owever, given the shock that the pandemic has delivered to the \neconomy and households , there is some uncertainty as to how quickly or forcefully households \nwill want to run off their saving buffer or resume accumulating debt. If households remain \nrelatively cautious  given a new understanding of possible health and economic  risks , the \nrecovery will be slower and lengthier. \nGiven the  uncertainties around the outlook, monetary policy remains highly \naccommodative, and is set to remain so for some time in line  with the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s (FOMC)  forward guidance. The Committee has stated that it expects to keep the \npolicy rate near zero unt il the labor market has reached levels consistent with maximum \n\n5 \n employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent \nfor some time. The FOMC also expects to maintain its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage -\nbacked s ecurities until substantial further progress has been made towards these employment and \ninflation goals.  \nBased on this  guidance, the FOMC is positioned  to be patient as it follows the outlook for \nthe virus and the economy. Certainly, it is too early to d iscuss pulling back on accommodation \ngiven continue elevated unemployment, below -target inflation, and the uncertainties surrounding \nthe outlook. Likewise, the notable recent rise in longer -term interest rates does not in my view \nwarrant a monetary policy response for several reasons. \nFirst, most of the rise in the ten -year Treasury this year appears to reflect an increase in \nthe real yield, that is the interest rate controlling for inflation compensation. Much of this increase likely reflects growing optimism in the strength of the recovery and could be viewed as an encouraging sign of increasing growth expectations. If this is indeed the reason that yields are \nincreasing, they are unlikely to rise to the point of smothering the optimism that led to their \nincrease in the first place , and measures of real yields remain deeply negative and only a touch \noff all -time lows.    \nSecond, any additional  stimulus could exacerbate the unevenness that has been the \ndefining characteristic of the pandemic downturn. Already, although appropriate, it seems likely that easing of monetary policy over t he last year has contributed to the observed unevenness. In \nparticular, interest -sensitive sectors , including housing and durable  goods consumption have \ndone quite well during the pandemic, supported by accommodative monetary policy, with many of these sectors reporting record years. Less interest -sensitive sectors, including many services, \n\n6 \n have benefited less, at least directly, from  accommodative monetary policy while  also suffering \nthe worst of  virus -related disruptions .  \nIt is unusual for a recession t o affect services more adversely than goods -producing \nsectors . In most recessions, interest -sensitive sectors, such as durable goods consumption, are \ngenerally  hit harder than non- interest sensitive sectors, such as services, and accommodative \nmonetary pol icy—by lowering interest rates —works to buffer the unevenness of a typical \nrecession . Given the unique nature of the pandemic shock, things are different this time . The \nshock has hit services spending harder than goods spending, and lower interest rates ha ve likely \ncontributed to unevenness rather than buffered it. In this situation , further monetary stimulus \nseems unlikely to help close gaps in the most virus -afflicted sectors while simultaneously \nrunning the risk of exacerbating imbalances and shortages in interest -sensitive sectors.   \nA third reason for patience on the part of policymakers, in my vi ew, is the likelihood of a \nstrong bounce back in activity as vaccination proceeds. Monetary policy tends to influence the \neconomy with a meaningful lag, and therefore f urther monetary stimulus at this point could \neasily be mistimed.  \nWith a patient stance o f accommodative monetary policy, the prospect of a strong \nrebound in activity, and signals of higher inflation compensation in the ten -year Treasury yield, \nthere has been considerable speculation about the risk of  higher future inflation.  Right now, the  \ninflation picture is a muddled one.  \nLast August, the Federal Reserve announced a revised framework for the conduct of \nmonetary policy.  One motivation for the revised framework was a desire to firm up inflation \nexpectations at a level consistent with the Fed’s 2 percent inflation objective. In this regard, the Committee  announced that the Fed would seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, such \n\n7 \n that periods of inflation persistently below 2 percent would be followed by periods of inflation \nmoderately above 2 percent. By shoring up inflation expectations, the Fed hopes to limit further slippage in nominal interest rates and decrease the risk of interest rates hitting zero and constraining monetary policy. In this regard, t he recent increase in inflation compensation is a \npromising signal  that markets take seriously the Fed’s commitment to stabilize inflation \nexpectation s near its 2 percent objective.   \nCurrently aggregate PCE inflation remains a bit short of that objective, running at 1.3 \npercent over the year ending in December, as the pandemic has hit some  prices  particularly hard, \nincluding airfares and hotel accommodation. Notwit hstanding muted inflation in the aggregate, \nthe components of this measure reveal  a particularly muddled inflation picture. While some \nprices are down, other sectors, particularly durable goods, are recording their fastest price increases in decades. In fact, by some measures, the dispersion in inflation across sectors has never been greater, a further indication of the current uneven economy.\n1  \nOne consequence of such wide dispersion is that any measure  of overall  inflation  \nbecomes  less meaningful . Overall  inflation is constructed by averaging inflation a cross \nindividual sector s weighted by their importance in aggregate consumption. While we would like  \nfor overall  inflation to reveal the trend in prices across the entire economy , a wide d ispersion in \ninflation across individual sectors  makes overall  inflation less informative for that trend. As an \nexample of this, with very disparate inflation it is likely that individual households are currently \nexperiencing very different inflation rates  dependent on the distinct set of goods and services that \nthey consume . Certainly some households might be surprised to hear that  overall  inflation is \n \n1 For example, the product of the fraction of expenditures experiencing two -standard deviation declines in inflation \nand the fraction of expenditures experiencing two- standard deviation increases in inflation reached a record high in \nNovember.   \n\n8 \n subdued given the particular basket of goods  and services  that they are consuming. More \ngenerally, i t is also worth recognizing that overall inflation  could firm up quickly post -\nvaccination as demand for hard -hit sectors recovers.  \nMonitoring these price signals and progress on employment will remain essential  even as \nthe FOMC takes a patient approach to monetary policy. Once the fog of the uncertainties \ncurrently obscuring the outlook clears, those policy settings will necessarily be reconsidered."

            "content": "Real Estate: A Vital Sector Poised for Change  \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n       \n                 \nFebruary 16, 2021  \nUniversity of Missouri -Kansas City Real Estate Symposium  \nKansas City, Mo. \n  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n   I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this year’s UMKC real estate forum , and I \nlook forward to our discussion. The real estate sector is a vital part of our economy. For a \npolicymaker, following developments in real estate is essential. As of year -end 2019, it \naccounted for a quarter of household assets and 40 percent of business assets. The construction industry alone employs more than 5 percent of the nation’s workforce , and  housing is the \nsecond -largest component of personal consumption, topped only by healthcare. As such, \nfluctuations in the value of real estate can affect  household consumption, business activity  and \nthe health and stability of our financial system .  \nThe pandemic has disrupted al l aspects of the economy , including real estate. The sharp \ndrop in activity last spring, as consumers pulled back and restrictions impeded business, coincided with a jump in the unemployment rate from 50- year lows to levels not seen since the \nGreat Depress ion. Since then, the economy has bounced back, supported by a tremendous \namount of fiscal support and very accommodative monetary policy. But the recovery so far has \nbeen both incomplete  and uneven, as close to 10 million jobs have yet to return, and some \nsectors struggle even as others have reported record years. As I will discuss, this unevenness has also been apparent within real estate, as the residential sector has boomed even as non -residential \nhas lagged.  \nAs vaccination progresses and the virus is br ought under control, we could see a further \nrobust recovery in economic activity, likely by the second half of this year. That said, even as we recover, it seems clear that we are not going back to where we started. The pandemic will likely result in, or at least accelerate, structural changes in the economy, and, as you are well  aware, \nreal estate seems poised to be on the forefront of these changes.  \n\n2 \n In my remarks today, I will review how real estate markets have weathered the pandemic \nso far. I’ll also note some of the long- term structural challenges confronting the sector, closing \nwith a review of the implications for  real estate finance and the health and stability of the  \nfinancial system  more generally.  As always, all of my views are wholly my own. \n \nNear- term d evelopments  \nAs discussed earlier, one of the defining features of our current economy is its \nunevenness, a feature that carries over to the real estate sector . On the positive side , single -family \nhousing is booming. Existing sales, prices, and starts all rose sharply during the second half of \n2020 and look poised to remain strong for some time. In the Kansas City metropolitan area, permits for new single -family home s in the fourth quarter of 2020 were up by 33 percent from \none year earlier, somewhat higher than national increase of 25 percent. Housing has been supported by record- low mortgage rates and an apparent increased demand for living space, as \nhouseholds  adjust to pandemic restrictions and many people work from home .  \nFor multifamily housing, the picture is more mixed. Compared to a year earlier, rents in \nthe fourth quarter  were down sharply in the center  of many large metropolitan areas, pulling \ndown average apartment rent s by about 4 percent  on a national basis . But in many medium and \nsmaller metropolitan areas, especially in suburban locations, rents have held firm and even increased. In the Kansas City metropolitan area, apartment rents have fallen modestly in the city \nproper but have increased in almost all suburban markets. V acancies have varied similarly: up \nconsiderably in the center  of many large metropolitan areas but holding firm and even declining \nelsewhere. However, vacancy rates may be misleadingly low, held down by the eviction \n\n3 \n moratorium. The Census Bureau estimates that more than one in six renters —more  than three  \ntimes the typical rate —were behind on rent at the end of January.1  \nConditions for non- residential real estate have varied as well. Despite an uptick in \nvacancies , office rents were about unchanged over the year . More  concerning, however, are hotel \nand retail properties. Tenants in these sectors have experienced declining demand as the \npandemic led to  a sharp drop in travel, reduced dining out, and a large shift in shopping from in-\nperson to online. As a result , hotel occupancy has dropped and retail vacancies have jumped, \npushing rents down.    The longer- term real outlook  \nLooking further out , I think it is likely that the pandemic will cause, or at least hasten, \nsome significant structural changes  in real estate. One development that has attracted \nconsiderable attention is the  rise of remote work. Many companies have discovered that they can \nperform well, wi th employees remaining highly productive, in a remote stance. As a result, a \nmajority of surveyed executives expressed a willingness to allow their office employees to work remotely some of the time once the health crisis has passed.\n2 However , most execut ives who \nfavor the option to work remotely also stress the importance of regularly working on- site in order \nto foster collaboration and to build company culture. M ost surveyed office employees also  \nexpressed a desire to work remotely some of the time after  the virus fades as a concern , with a \nsizeable minority saying they would like to do so all of the time.3  \n \n1 Parrott, Jim and Mark Zandi. 2021. “ Averting an Eviction Crisis .” Moody’s Analytics .  \n2 PwC. 2021. “ It’s Time to Reimagine Where and How Work Will Get Done: PwC’s U.S. Remote Work Survey, \nJanuary 12, 2021 .” PwC, January 12.  \n3 PwC. 2021. “ It’s Time to Reimagine Where and How Work Will Get Done: PwC’s U.S. Remote Work Survey, \nJanuary 12, 2021 .” PwC, January 12.  \n\n4 \n  In addition to affecting the overall demand for office space, it seems likely that an \nincrease in  remote working could significantly affect the geo graphy of economic activity. \nAssuming that employers and employees coalesce to a hybrid model, the most meaningful \nimpact of a rise in remote work could be a reduction in commuting time , which could affect \nwhere workers want to live and where businesses decide to locate. Estimates suggest that if \nemployees in occupations amenable to remote working on average worked from home two days per week, the decline in daily commuting volume would cut one -way travel time on many \nhighway segments by 20 percent or more.\n4 Saved time would likely be greatest in large \nmetropolitan areas, where traffic congestion has been worst and travel times highest. \nLess frequent commutes and faster speeds would likely make many workers willing to \nlive further away from their place  of employment , and could increase the desirability of living in \nthe outlying suburbs of metropolitan areas, where large tracts of lightly- settled land are available \nfor development. The current boom in single -family construction likely rests in part on this \nincreased willingness to live farther from work, with households anticipating increased remote working following the end of the pandemic.  \nTurning to the location of workplaces, less frequent commutes and faster speeds may lead  \nsome companies to shift t heir offices from suburban locations to central ones. In particular, less \ncommuting  would diminish  some of the current advantages of suburban offices . Fewer \ncommutes lessen  the advantage of locating closer to residential neighborhoods . Fewer  workers \ncoming in on any given day also lessens the advantage of plentiful parking at suburban \nworkplaces.  \n \n4 Rappaport, Jordan.  2021.  “Hybrid Officing Will Shift Where People and Businesses Decide to Locate .” Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Bulletin , February 3 . \n\n5 \n The cost advantage of suburban compared to downtown offices may also diminish. To \nthe extent that an individual company cuts back on leased office space, rent would become a \nsmaller share of its total business expenses. Moreover, as many companies cut back on leased office space, the corresponding decrease in total demand would put downward pressure on office rents regardless of location, also cutting down on rent as a share of total business expenses. The decrease in office rents as a share of business expenses lessens the incentive to avoid locations with premium rents, such as downtowns. \nOf course, we are in the early stages of seeing how these trends play out, a nd much \nremains uncertain. However, f rom a broader perspective any significant change in the location of \neconomic activity, regardless of its specific form, has the potential to significantly affect the valuations of residential and commercial real estate.  These revaluations, in turn, have important \nfinancial stability implications, to which I turn next.  \n \nImplication for f inancial s tability  \nOver the past several decades we have learned that the financial stability implications of \nreal estate can hardly be understated. Most recently , many accounts trace the roots of the 2008 \nfinancial crisis to excesses in residential real estate financing . In addition, the lessons from \ndisruptions to commercial real estate financing in the aftermath of the financial crisis are equally important today. While the strains on real estate finance currently appear contained, this relative health has been importantly supported by the extraordinary policy response to the pandemic . If \nsupport fades  ahead of a sustained recovery , stresses could become more prominent, especially \nagainst a backdrop of disruptive structural change.  \n\n6 \n Going into the pandemic , the residential market was in a much better place than it had \nbeen prior to the financial crisis , in part due to regulatory changes adopted after that crisis .  \nStrengthened  underwriting standards  contributed to a decline in the share of non- prime mortgage  \nbalances and , overall , households had been deleveraging for most of the last decade. As a result, \nthe U.S. household debt service ratio—debt service payments as a share of personal disposable \nincome —had declined considerably. At the same time, household net -worth increased, driven \nlargely by stock market and real estate gains. The way housing is financed has also changed, with non- banks  increasing origination share , while the largest banks and private label \nsecuritization pulled back.   \nThe onset of COVID -19 led to an immediate slowdown in origination activity as the \npandemic temporarily dampened real estate showings, interior appraisals, and in- person closings. \nHowever, a sharp decline in mortgage rates, following the Fed’s forceful monetary policy respons e to the pandemic , has helped revive the market, increasing demand for both purchases \nand refinancing.   \nWhile origination activity has bounced back to record levels, other parts of the residential \nmortgage market may require careful monitoring. In particular, delinquencies remain low due to the extraordinary policy measures undertaken during the pandemic. For example, the CARES Act passed last spring included temporary payment forbearance on federally backed mortgages. The share of mortgages in forbearance peaked at 8.8 percent in June 2020 but has since moderated to 5.2 percent in January 2021;  the unpaid principal balance on these mortgages  is \nestimated to be $548 billion.\n5 The uptake in forbearance temporarily reduces transition rates into \ndelinquency but creates the potential for a future wave of foreclosures when borrowers exit \n \n5 Based o n observations using Black Knight’s McDash Flash data. Monthly reports  available at  \nhttps://www.blackknightinc.com/data -reports/  \n\n7 \n forbearance. Currently, mortgage debt levels relative to home valuations are not elevated and the \nestimated share of households with negative equity is low. These con siderations not only dampen \ndefault rates but also reduce losses for lenders if borrowers were to default, thereby lowering risks of spillovers to broader financial markets.  \nThe pandemic has  also highlighted vulnerabilities associated with  non- depository \nmortgage companies —in short, nonbanks  that originat e and servic e mortgages . As I mentioned \nearlier , nonbanks have more than doubled their market share over the previous decade  and \ncurrently originate over 60 percent of new mortgages. Nonbanks  typically rely on short -term \nfunding and are subject to making servicing advances on delinquent borrowers. Therefore, significant increases in nonpayment can impose capital and liquidity s trains for these nonbanks, \nwhich happened in the early days of the pandemic. Measures enacted by federal agencies to lessen the burden of advances on loan forbearances and a quick policy- aided rebound in \norigination activity helped relieve the strains on nonbanks. Nevertheless, the viability  of nonbank \nmortgage originators and servicers is critical for providing mortgage credit access , especially in \nunderserved communities where nonbanks have a significant presence.  \nStrains in the commercial real estate ma rket could also pose significant threats to \nfinancial stability. Past experience shows that severe downturns in the commercial property \nmarket can destabilize the banking system, and  regulators have taken numerous steps to address \nthese risks. In particular, c ommercial real estate concentrations at smaller banks declined below \nthe levels seen prior to the 2008 financial crisis  and capital levels increased significantly. Still, \nbalance sheet holdings  have  increas ed the past few years  with commercial real estate loans \nmaking up more than one -quarter of all assets held at smaller community banks at the end of \n2019.  \n\n8 \n To date, however, credit performance has held up reasonably well . So far, d elinquency \nrates on bank loans secured by commercial properties  have recorded modest increases and are \nsignificantly lower than what was anticipated by bankers, regulators and market analysts in the  \nearly days of the pandemic. Both direct and indirect measures have helped to support the flow of \ncredit . For example, direct measures such as regulatory encouragement for banks to work \nconstructively with borrowers and the expansion of the Term Asset -Backed Loan Facility (TALF \n2020) to include certain commercial mortgage backed -securities (CMBS) provided support for \nportfolio and securitized commercial real estate lending.  \nAdditionally, the extraordinary measures taken by the Federal Reserve and the Treasu ry \nhelped both lenders and borrowers in this market. On the borrower side, enhanced \nunemployment insurance as well as funds made available to businesses through the Main Street Lending facility and the Paycheck Protection Program  aided commercial property tenants  to keep \nrental payments flowing. On the lender side, these extraordinary measures provided capital and \nliquidity support to banks and other lenders to help them voluntarily offer forbearance to distressed borrowers and to supply additional credit t o this market. As such, forbearance has \nbeen a significant  contributor  to improved metrics of CRE loan performance. Still, market \nanalysts predict that a significant volume of  commercial loans currently in modification \nprograms may  ultimately default.\n 6   \nGiven this backdrop, a worrying scenario is that  the economic impact of the pandemic \noutlasts the policy support programs currently in place. Should that occur, many renters and businesses could find themselves unable to meet their obligations, forcing ba nks to realize losses \non existing loans and weighing on credit growth and broader economic activity.  \n \n6 Stovall, Nathan. 2021, “Deferrals plunge, credit migration minimal heading into ominous winter. ” S&P Global \nMarket Intelligence, Research & Analysis. January 5 . \n\n9 \n  \nConclusion  \nDevelopments in real estate have important implications for the broad economic \nrecovery, both in terms of growth and employment, as well as for financial stability. Just as with the aggregate economy, the effect of the pandemic on real estate has been uneven as the boom in single -family residential housing has been accompanied by higher vacancy rates in most \nsegments of commercial real estate. While it is important to acknowledge the role of policy in supporting the real estate market, it is also important to be aware of the forthcoming challenges when this support is withdrawn, especially against the backdrop of longer -term structural \nchanges to the outlook."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n      \n                \nJanuary 12, 2021  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo. \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  Thank you for inviting me to participate in your event today. I appreciate the opportunity \nto speak with you about my outlook for the nation’s economy and look forward to our \ndiscussion. As we turn the calendar to a new year, the opportunity to reflect on the past and to look ahead to the future  is a time -honored tradition. Today I will do a little of both. \n Last year was one for the record books. The year had  both the largest  decl ine in quarterly \nGDP  on record as well as the largest increase. The unemployment rate hit a  50-year low before \nclimbing to levels not seen since the Great Depression . The equity market  set record highs, while \nthe price of oil dropped below zero for the first time ever, if only for a moment. The year  saw the \nlargest fiscal policy reaction and the most rapid increase in government debt , even as  the yield on \ngovernment securities  fell to new lows . The Federal Reserve, for its part, broke new ground in \npolicy accommodation, while expanding its balance sheet to record size. Suffice to say, 2020 \nwas not a typical  year.  \n I am hopeful, as I believe many of us are, that 2021 will mark the beginning of a return to \nsomething more like normal . Just two weeks in, we are off to a rocky start. However, I am \ngenerally optimistic that the year will be one of continued economic recovery, though not without bumps and potholes , particularly in the first part of the year as the virus continues to \nexact a terrible human and economic toll.  \n In my remarks t oday, I will offer my  outlook for the economy, noting my growing \nconfidence in the recovery, notwithstanding near -term turbulence. Underlying this outlook are \nmy expectations about a path to resolving the pandemic, renewed fiscal support and the continued accommodative stance of monetary policy. Even as the economy recovers , the events \nof the last year are likely  to leave an imprint on the economic outlook for years to come. There is \nno going back to where we started, and I’ll highlight my own thoughts on some of the longer -\n\n2 \n term consequences of the pandemic. Finally, I will turn to what this all means for the path of \nmonetary policy.  \n The Economic Outlook  \nStarting with  the outlook, e conomic activity appears to have stalled at the end of last \nyear. Consumer spending edged down broadly, not just in the contact -intensive service sectors  \nmost sensitive to the path of the virus, but also for durable  goods , which have been quite strong \nup to now . The widespread nature of this  pullback suggests that fading fiscal support along with \nuncertainty about the timing of any new government transfers likely weighed on activity , as did \nthe resurgence of the virus  across the country.  \nWith the v irus still impe ding the resumption of many activities, employment growth also \nhas stalled , with the economy shedding 140,000 jobs in December . Given that we ended the year \nstill 10 million jobs short relative to  before the pandemic, the re remains quite a large gap to \nclose. About a third of the jobs that have yet to come back are in the high- contact leisure and  \nhospitality industry, making it likely that the pace of employment growth will remain lackluster until widespr ead vaccination is achieved and the virus diminishes as an everyday concern.   \nOverall, much of the optimism for eventual recovery this year is tied to a successful and \nwidespread vaccination program . One of the most substantial risks to the outlook is a significant \ndelay or disruption in the administration of the vaccine. Already, a slower -than-expected roll out \nhas led many analysts to push back their estimates  for when the U nited States  might achieve \nbroad- based immunity . It is difficult to imagine a sustained and robust recovery until the virus no \nlonger interferes with the public’s day- to-day decision -making.    \n\n3 \n That said, there is reason to be optimistic about the economy’s growth prospects post -\nvaccination. One signal has come from equity markets , which have responded favorably to \npositive vaccine news. Sectors that have been particularly hard hit by the virus, including air \ntravel  and leisure and hospitality, have seen some of the largest price gains , suggesting that \ninvestors, at least, are optimistic that demand could bounce  back strongly for these still -\ndepressed services. Inventories are another dynamic  that could support strong growth later this \nyear. B usinesses, and particular ly retail establishments, ran down their inventories  during the \nearly stages of the pandemic, unsure of future sales prospects. A sustained recovery in demand could prompt businesses to restock, boosting production and growth, even if perhaps also straining some supply chains .   \nThe additional fiscal support passed at the end of last year also se ts the stage for a strong \nrecovery. A renewed Paycheck Protection Program offers the prospect of sustaining small businesses until demand picks up, avoiding the significant cost and disruption of bankruptcy or \nclosure. Transfer payments in the CARES A ct had boosted aggregate personal income to an all -\ntime high in the spring, even as wage income fell off steeply, providing a key support to consumption and the economy. In recent months, personal income had been trending down, as the payments faded and wage in come has yet to fully recover. The new fiscal package, with \nenhanced unemployment benefits and household stimulus payments, should once  again push up \npersonal income, maintaining support for spending and growth.  \nAs with the earlier government transfers, t here is a high likelihood that a large portion of \nthe renewed fiscal support will end up being saved by households rather than spent. In April, the \npersonal saving rate shot up to a record 34 percent, as transfer payments boost ed income and \nCovid restrictions and concerns  limited consumption. Although the saving rate has come down \n\n4 \n since, it remains almost twice as high as the average prior to the pandemic.  Of course, fiscal \nsupport that is saved has less of an immediate impact on growth than that which is spent , but it \nalso is true that transfers that strengthen  household balance sheets  can prevent  a pullback in \nspending that might otherwise occur as households demand higher  precautionary buffers  in an \nuncertain environment . Also, once concern for the virus  ebbs, relatively healthy household \nbalance sheets should allow for a quick rebound in demand and a resumption of activity. To the \nextent such dynamics prevail, the economy might avoid the experience of the Global Financial \nCrisis , when even after  the recession ended there was a prolonged period of household \ndeleveraging that contributed to a lackluster pace of growth for years.   \n Long- Term Implications of the Pandemic \nWhen thinking about the long- term consequences of 2020, I find it helpful to group the \npotential factors into three broad categories. First, despite the best efforts of policymakers, t here \nare likely to be  scars from the crisis that will take time to heal. Businesses and workers have \nsuffered a tremendous disruption, and while the re is some optimism for a quick bounce -back, it \nwould not be unexpected for some of the negative effects to  persist . Second, the crisis will leave \na lasting impact  on business  and public  sector  balance sheets , with governments  taking on \nnotably more debt, central bank balance sheets  swelling  around the world, and corporate \nborrowing soaring, even as household balance sheets , in the aggregate, have improved. Third, the \ncrisis  will likely have a lasting effect on the structure of the economy, both by changing the way \nthat people work as well as what and how they consume.       \nStarting with the f irst of these three broad categories , there could be economic sc arring \nthat eventually heals , but only after some time. For example, as mentioned earlier, 10 million \n\n5 \n fewer  individuals are working now relative to before the pandemic . Given the notable  decline in \nlabor force participation over the same period, it would appear that about half of those workers \nthat lost jobs dropped out of the labor force altogether. Traditionally, i t has taken some time to \nbring individuals back into the l abor force, and it has often taken a fairly hot labor market to do \nso.   \nAn additional dynamic with this crisis h as been the disproportionate decline in labor \nforce partici pation among woman. In particular, about half of the decline in wom en’s \nparticipation is attributable  to caregiving, likely reflecting disruptions in child care. While this \ncould suggest a quicker bounce -back once the virus is checked and normal child care options \nreturn , it is important to note that even after  returning to the job, these workers could suffer  \ninterruptions in human capital development and career progression, with unfortunate  long- term \neffects.  \nTurning to the s econd  broad category , 2020 has scrambled balance sheets  across the \neconomy. While household balance sheets  are generally i n good shape , this has come at the \nexpense of government finances . The federal government  increased its liabilities to fund \ntransfers that, in many cases, have turned into household assets. Again , it must be noted that the \nrelative strength  of household balance sheets is in the aggregate. Certainly, the pandemic has led \nto significant economic hardship for many, as a large number of households struggle to pay bills and purchase necessities. One of the defining features of the pandemic has be en the unevenness \nof its economic impact. There has been substantial variation in how different industries, \nprofessions and geographies have been affected, with some sectors reporting record activity even as others have seen demand collapse.     \n\n6 \n On the bus iness side, non- financial corporations  have further increased borrowing from \nalready elevated levels, in part to cover pandemic -related holes in revenue but also, for larger \ncorporations, to take advantage of near -zero interest rates and favorable borrowing conditions .  \nThese shifts in balance sheets can have long -run impacts. For example , the large increase in \ngovernment debt could limit a fiscal policy response during some future crisis. Higher levels of \nbusiness debt could threaten financial stab ility, increasing the fragility of the financial system to \nprospective shocks.  \nFinally, l ooking at the t hird broad category , the pandemic has likely unleashed, or at least \naccelerated,  structural and technological changes  that will contin ue to play out over years or even \ndecades.  These include a shift to remote work , as well as online retail and entertainment. While \nthese changes could ultimately result in increase d economic  productivity, there will likely be \nnear- and medium -term disruptions as resource s shift between sectors . These changes also \nincrease the risks around  the value of capital in certain sectors —for example, commercial and \nretail real estate —which  could in turn raise important financial stability considerations.    \n Monetary Policy  \nAn excep tionally  uncertain economic outlook, with the chance of both downside and \nupside surprises , creates a complicated  and difficult environment for monetary policy. While t he \nvaccine promises an eventual end to the virus’s hold on the economy, there remains a substantial gap to be bridged before we get there. With the most recent fiscal package, the economy could get the necessary momentum to  bridge this gap and prevent  standard recessionary dynamics  from \ntaking hold before we reach the s afety  of widespread vaccination.   \n\n7 \n Monetary policy is also playing an important role in supporting the economy, as it has \nsince the start of the pandemic. In March, t he Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) cut its \npolicy inte rest rate to near zero  and launched an aggressive balance sheet expansion program, \npurchasing large quantities of Treasuries  and Mortgage -Backed Securities  (MBS). While the se \npurchases were initially directed towards smoothing market functioning, the expansion of the \nFed’s balance sheet also supports accommodative financial conditions, to the benefit of the overall economy. In September, the FOMC provided forward guidance, consistent with the Fed’s new monetary policy framework, that interest rates would remain near zero until the labor \nmarket reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation had  both risen to 2 \npercent and was on track to exceed 2 percent for some time. In December, the Committee further extended its forward guidance to cover its asset purchases, s tating that it will continue to increase \nits holding of Treasuries and MBS by at least the current pace until substantial further progress has been made on its employment and inflation goals. Overall, the outlook is for monetary policy \nto remain accommodat ive for some time.        \nClearly, in the current environment where the economy continues to heal, an  \naccommodative policy stance is appropriate. It is too soon to speculate about the timing of any \nchange  in this stance . The Committee  has agreed that further substantial progress in achieving \nhigh employment and average inflation at its 2 percent target is necessary  before making \nadjustments . This wait -and-see approach will guide the trajectory of monetary policy. As the \ndata come in , and the  economy evolves, the public and markets should be able to adjust their \nexpectations regarding the policy path. This feature of forward guidance is especially useful now given the heightened uncertainty around the outlook, stemming in large part from  the path of the \n\n8 \n virus. In the near -term, the r isks are predominately negative , but once the pandemic is behind us , \nthere is  considerable  scope for a snapback in activity .   \nHowever, a s the economy recovers and the Committee judges progress toward its \nmanda te for employment and inflation, policymakers will necessarily wrestle with judgments \nabout the appropriate stance of its policy settings. With longer -term implications of the pandemic \nnoted earlier unfolding over time, these deliberations are likely to be challenging. For example, \nhow long- lasting will the effect s of the pandemic on the labor market  be? Should we expect  \nemployment to return to its lows of early 2020? Or w ill changes in the structure of the economy \nand labor markets shift employment’s long- run equilibrium ?   \nWill inflation continue to fall short of central bankers’ desired 2 percent long- run \naverage, or  will other dynamics take hold and shift inflation impulses ? For example, a lthough \naggregate inflation, as measured by the PCE index, remains muted, a few hard- hit services prices \nhave played a disproportionate role in depressing the aggregate index. To the extent that a post -\nvaccine bounce- back boosts demand and prices in these sectors, including airfares and hotel \naccommodation, inflation could move up quickly. Other large contributors to the decline in inflation are a bit idiosyncratic, including owner -occupied housing and financial servic es. In \ncontrast to these sectors, price inflation for many other  categories  of consumption (particularly \ngoods) has  moved up, sometimes quite sharply. Such a scenario does not suggest higher inflation \nis a near -term threat, but rather that inflation could approach the Committee’s average inflation \nobjective more quickly than some might expect.   \nFinally, will highly accommodative monetary policy seed imbalances in the economy that \nincrease the fragility of the economy to the next inevitable shock? Will othe r mechanisms \neffectively mitigate and balance any destabilizing elements of a low -for-long rate environment?  \n\n9 \n As we  close the chapter on 2020, the N ew Y ear ushers in its own mix of optimism and \nchallenges. The experience of the pandemic will undoubtedly leave its mark even as our nation’s \neconomy shows its resilience  and recovers. Ultimately, the wisdom to understand this unfolding \nlandscape and to respond  with appropr iate policy adjustments will set the course for achieving \nour objectives for financial stability, sustainable long- run growth, employment and inflation."

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n       \n            \nDecember 11, 2020  \n \nDelivered during panel discussion on “ Transparency in Bank Supervision”  \nat “Bank Supervision: Past, Present and Future,” an online conference hosted by \nThe Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Harvard University and  \nthe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania  \n \nThe views expressed by th e author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n  \n I appreciate the opportunity to share my views a nd take part in this discussion. Having \nspent a significant portion of my Fed career associated with the business of bank supervision, I \napproach this topic from the perspective of a practitioner. \nI joined the Kansas City Fed in 1982 as a bank examiner.  Since then, I’ve observed \nhundreds of banks fail across the co untry for a variety of reasons . Yet, I can’t recall a single one \nsuccumbing to that fate that was well capitalized, well managed, and well supervised. Of course, \nconsiderable research has been devoted to the issue of bank capital and the dynamics of \ngovernance.  Considerably less scholarship has focus ed on what i t means to be “well supervised ,” \nand so I look forward to the deliberations of this conference in advancing our thinking on that dimension. \nMore than two decades ago, the Federal Reserve released a study on improving public \ndisclosure in banking.\n1 The report focused on market discipline and transparency as a response \nto a changing banking landscape . The evolution of the financial system ha d contributed to \ngrowing complexity in financial instruments and services, as well as increasing the scale and scope of the nation’s largest banks. At that time, market discipline was viewed as a preferred alternative to large -scale expansion of supervision  and regulation as a means of limiting \nexcessive risk -taking by large, complex financial institutions. Proposed c hanges focused on \nregulatory reporting and a wider  scope of disclosures by large banks.  \nImproving public access to information on banking orga nizations  could have many \nbenefits, including enhancing market discipline , promoting effective management,  and enforcing \nsupervisory accountability.  However, the public benefits of transparency must necessarily be \n \n1 Federal Reserve System. 2000. \"Improving Public Disclosure in Banking (Staff Study 172) .\" Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System. March.  \n\n2 \n balanced with the need for confidentiality.  This does not mean that more transparency guarantees  \ngreater stability or that there are rigid disclosure standards that can be easily applied across all \ncircumstances.  Recalibrating the existing boundaries of CSI must be approached through the lens \nof the public’s interest in a fair, stable and sound financial system.  Importantly, the value of \ntransparency  is not in the volume of information disclosed, but rather in the clarity it provides in \npromoting responsible, effective management of the supervised entit ies. \nTo that end, several questions are worth considering. How do the traditional protections \nafforded to CSI and other supervisory practices contribute to financial stability? Are there ways in which greater transparency might strengthen both risk management and supervisory accountability ? Do the answers to these two questions change during times of crisis or systemic \nstress?  Should there be some additional consideration based on the institution’s size, risk profile \nor sys temic importance ? \nBefore continuing, I will remind you that my views are wholly my own.  \n What’s the Big Secret?  \nBroadly speaking, the rationale for CSI is a sound one in my view. T wo reasons are \ncommonly given as the foundation for protecting CSI :\n2 \n• First, some degree of confidentiality is desirable to ensure the security of financial \ninstitutions and to protect against unintended and adverse effects that might result \nfrom the disclosure of certain types of se nsitive supervisory information. This \ncould include  customer data, proprietary market intelligence , or even candid \n \n2 Department of Justice. 2020. \" Department of Justice Guide to  the Freedom of Information Act .\" United States \nDepartment of Justice.  \n\n3 \n supervisory assessments, such as control  weaknesses in critical operating \ninfrastructure , the public exposure of which might compromise banks’  safety.  \n• Second, confidentiality can help foster a relationship of trust between supervisors \nand the institutions, enabling frank dialogue and creating an environment in which \nbank management may be more likely to cooperate with examiners.  \nIn my e xperience, both of these are desirable features of effective supervision .  \nSupervisors’ detailed access to bank activities and their analysis of proprietary and internal \ninformation place them in a unique position to assess risk exposures that may not be available  \nfrom other independent sources.  \n Where Might More Disclosure Add Value? Might we foster a more stable financial system through greater transparency and market \ndiscipline, and if so, how?  I believe the answer is a qualified yes. Greater disclosure can create \nincentives for more responsible risk management and contribute to a strong and trusted banking system. There are of course trade- offs, and we should carefully consider how much detail  is \nnecessary to promote the outcomes we seek.   \nWhen considering transparency, d rawing distinctions between institutions based on their \nsize, complexity and risk profile should be a consideration. For example, during the financial \ncrisis, s tress testing the nation’s largest banks was introduced as a way to enhance public \nconfidence  in the nation’s financial system . The announcement of the Supervisory Capital \nAssessment Program (SCAP) results in 2009 provided information to the public regarding the \nscale o f potential losses that the largest banks might incur if the economy were to continue to \n\n4 \n deteriorate.3 Continued disclosure  of firm -specific information regarding capital adequacy \nthrough the annua l CCAR and DFAST exercises  has been viewed as valuable in supporting \npublic confidence in the banking sector and str onger  capital  planning practices . Should we go \neven further? Given these firms’ systemic importance, and the history of government support \nprovided in prior financial cr ises, one might argue that more transparency might be beneficial  \nand even justified . Increased  transparency  is likely to be most effective in providing market \ndiscipline  for the largest banks, who have  an active and attentive investor base  to monitor their  \nactiviti es and risk -taking.4 \nOn the other hand, for smaller banks where the capital is closely held or not widely \ntraded it might be more problematic to apply the same standard of transparency without risking harm to the institutions themselves and to the communities , and people, they serve.  For example, \ndisclosing certain types of information might reveal potentially sensitive details about a smaller institution’s customers.  And given many of these institutions’ size and governance structures, \ndisclosure might not result in the same positive effects possible in the case of larger institutions.  \nAn individual smaller institution is unlikely to pose risk to financial stability, so without a systematic way to disclos e relevant information , the value of disc losure may be limited.  \nA second consideration is the degree of detail included in disclosure and the types of \ninformation disclosed. The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  has recently sought to increase \naccountability  and transparency in aggregate throu gh the publication of the Financial Stability \nReport and the Supervision and Regulation Report .\n5 These reports offer the public greater insight \ninto the Federal Reserve’s approach to supervision, including observations on trends and broad \n \n3 Board of Governors . 2009. \" The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Overview of Results .\" May 7.  \n4 George, Esther. 2013. \" Effective Supervisi on: Balancing New and Traditional Approaches .\" Paris, November 22.  \n5 Board of Governors. n.d. \" Financial Stability Report\" and \"Supervision and Regulation Report .\" Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, Publicati ons. \n\n5 \n themes in supervision for both large and small institutions, and views on systemic risks. While \nthese report s include  neither  detailed nor firm -specific information , there may be opportunities \nfor greater transparency in sharing aggregated information about supervisory themes and trends . \nConsidering the type of information to be disclosed is important given that CSI is broadly \ndefined and includes information contained in exam reports, ratings, sensitive customer information, or proprietary business information, among othe rs.\n6 One aspect of this confidential \ninformation that frequently surfaces as a candidate for disclosure is key or material findings from examinations.   \nTypically, s upervisors disclose material matters at the point of seeking corrective action,  \nsuch as th ose included in formal enforcement actions.  However, a bsent risks to financial \nstability, requiring banking organizations to disclose material findings could be useful . This \nwould also necessitate a careful consideration of the process by which such disclosure might \noccur and what, if any, standards might govern it . For example, w ould disclosure of supervisory \ncriticis ms be best shared categorically  by risk area, or verbatim?   \nFinally, approaches for disclosure must contem plate how markets could react in times of \ncrisis or systemic stress.  As already noted, the disclosure of stress testing results for larger \ninstitutions during the 2008 financial crisis played an important stabilizing role in reassuring the \npublic. However,  no two crises are exactly alike, and it is difficult to know beforehand precisely \nwhat kind of information might help restore confidence in the financial system during the next \ncrisis. For example, in the late 1980s, Citi was the first bank to make a lar ge provision against its \n \n6 For the Board of Governor s’ definition of CSI , see the Rules Regarding the Availability of Information, 12 C.F.R.  \n§ 261 , which describe the Board’s procedures for protecting confidential information as per the Freedom of \nInformation Act,  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(8) . \n\n6 \n Latin American exposures, and many thought the market would react negatively.7  Instead, the \nnews had a positive effect, as  markets wondered whether big banks were reserving enough or \nhad the capacity to do so. \n \nConclusion  \nSupervisors  and the industry need to weigh the implications of greater transparency for \nboth stability and better management of risk . Incorporat ing some degree of supervisory \ndiscretion rather than prescriptive statements or standards will likely be necess ary.   \nI look forward to the discussion and research coming out of this conference to guide our \nthinking on this important issue. \n \n   \n \n \n7 Sachs, Jeffery D. 1989. \"New Approaches to the Latin American Debt Crisis .\" Princeton University, International \nEconomics Section, Studies in International Economics, Essays in International Finance, No. 174.

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nNovember  20, 2020  \nDelivered via video at “Navigating the Changing Energy Landscape,” a conference hosted by the \nFederal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n  Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to host this year’s conference with President Kaplan and \nhis team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.  Combined, our  two Federal Reserve districts \nserve an area of the central United States that accounts  for almost half of the nation’s energy \nproduction. Th is includes around 60 percent of its oil and gas  production, as well as nearly 60 \npercent of the electricity generated by wind power. Obviously, e nergy plays an important role in \nour regional economies  and employs  a substantial number of workers, but it is also a central \ncomponent of national economic activity with implications for monetary policy. \n My remarks today will focus on this  interaction of the energy  sector  and monetary policy. \nEnergy plays a key role in determining the environment  in which monetary policy operates. It is \na direct component of  economic output  through production, employment and investment  in the \nsector . Energy also  creates  indirect spillovers to other industries , government finances and \nconsumers . At the same time, monetary policy,  through its effect  on interest rates and asset \nprices , has implications for the energy sector, primarily by shaping aggregate demand, but  also \nthrough its impact on commodity prices and perhaps the structure of the industry.    Energy Production:  Booms and Busts   \n I will start with some observations on energy’s role in shaping the economy . Given the \ndiscussion earlier today, and the expertise represented in the forum, I will only briefly touch on the direct contribution of energy production to overall output, focusing primarily on tracing its indirect effects through other economic sectors. This is certainly not any indication of the lack of importance  of direct effects . Booms and busts in the oil sector have led to large swings in \nemplo yment and investment, particularly  for regional economies that rely on the sector . Still, oil, \ngas and coal  production accounts f or roughly half a million jobs, or less than 1 percent of \n\n2 \n national employment  and around 1 percent of domestic output. While the sector itself is not that \nlarge in those terms , the jobs tend to pay high wages, and movements in employment affect  \nspending and consumption within many communities. \n Energy extraction also has a direct effect on aggregate output through capital investment. \nIn particular, following the 2014 collapse i n oil prices , energy investment took 2 percentage \npoints off overall business fixed investment growth in 2015 and 2016, contributing to the overall weakness of investment over this period.  \n Among the biggest shifts affecting  the energy sector  today is the growth of renewable \nenergy . Renewables now account for almost 20 percent of electricity generation, in part as the \ncost of solar power and wind power has fallen 85 and 70 percent , respectively , over the last \ndecade.\n1 As renewables continue to reshape the energy industry, there are likely to be shifts in \nemployment, investment and output , with notable effects on regional economies.  \nWhile much has been said about the difficulty in dealing with the short -term fluctuations \nin renewable power generation, employment and investment have been relatively smooth, with shifts more likely in response to lower costs and government incentives than to volatile demand. With  renewables continuing to gain market share, it may be  that energy diminishes as a source of \nmacroeconomic volatility.  Certainly, U.S. energy prices and output are likely to become more \ninsulated from global developments, the source of many energy se ctor shocks over the years.  \nWithout the geopolitics, energy could well  become more boring, which is maybe not such a bad \nthing.    However, the direct effects of the energy sector likely capture only a small portion of the \noverall impact on economic output  and growth. E nergy is interwoven with all aspects of activity, \n \n1 https://www.lazard.com/media/451419/lazards -levelized -cost-of-energy -version -140.pdf  \n\n3 \n and developments in energy spill  over widely. Given that the channels linking energy to the \noverall economy are incredibly complex and wide -ranging, I ’ll focus on four sectors —\nmanufacturing, agriculture, government finances  and consumers —which I believe illustrate  the \nbroader point : that an understanding of energy developments is essential for understanding \neconomic developments more generally, and therefore give  context for mon etary policy. In \nhighlighting these sectors, I will consider both cyclical movements, for example, the fall in oil \ndemand and prices related to the coronavirus, and longer -term structural developments  often \ndriven by technological factors, such as fracking, the falling price of renewables, or the advent of \nelectric vehicles.  Admittedly, separat ing cyclical and structural effects  can sometimes be \ndifficult.     Manufacturing:  Natural Gas and U.S. Comparative Advantage  \n I’ll start with manufacturing . Energy is an important input into manufacturing, and \nfluctuations in the price and availability of energy have important spillovers for the sector. I will \nhighlight one aspect of this : how the decline in the price of natural gas relative to oil has boosted \nthe comparative advantage of U.S. manufacturing over the past decade , and how an increase in \nthe relative price of natural gas could unwind that advantage.   \n As technological advances led to  a sharp increase in U.S. natural gas production starting \nin 2006, the higher supply pushed down the price of natural gas relative to the alternatives and \nled industries  to substitute towards natural gas and a way from other energy sources. This was \ntrue for utilities, as has been well reported, but also manufacturers.\n2 The decline in the relative \n \n2 In 2006, natural gas accounted for 28% of U.S. manufacturing energy us age. By 2018, it was 37%. Usage of natural \ngas liquids also rose from 11% to 15%. This mainly replaced coal and fuel oil (EIA, 2020: \nhttps://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=45156 ). \n\n4 \n price of natural gas boost s the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing, in part because U.S. \nmanufacturers tend to use natural gas more extensively than their foreign competitors, who  are \noften more oil -dependent. F or example, oil’s share in manufacturing energy consumption is more \nthan five times higher in Europe than it is in the U nited States.3 This  difference in energy usage \nis particularly notable in the refinery, petrochemical  and plastics industries.  \n This comparative advantage is apparent in performance of U.S. exports. U nited States  \nexports of refined petroleum products, petrochemical s and pla stics increased 160  percent over \nthe period from 2006 to 2019, while exports of the same products from Europe rose only 25 \npercent.4 During this period the United States  became a leading exporter of gasoline and \npetroleum products and captured market share around the world. Overall, spillovers from low natural gas prices were likely an important support for U.S. exports in recent years and a contributor to the strength of  economic growth.    \n Recent developments , however , threaten  this comparative advantage.  This year , oil prices \nhave declined as natural gas prices  have increased , in part as falling U.S. oil production has cut \nback on the supply of associated natural gas production. The relative price of  Henry Hub natural \ngas to WTI oil fell by almost half  over the period from 2006 to 2019, but ticked up by almost a \nthird this year . If such a shift in re lative prices were to persist , and futures markets suggest that it \nwill, certain U.S. exports are likely to suffer a decline in competitiveness, and the aggregate economy is likely to face an additional headwind as we continue our recovery.  \n  \n \n3 Oil is less than 2 percent  of U.S. manufacturers ’ energy consumption (EIA), while it comprised 10.2 percent  of \nEuropean industry consumption in 2017 (EEA).  \n4 Data from WiserTrade, FRBKC calculations.  \n\n5 \n Agriculture:  Electric Cars Don’t Need Ethanol  \n The agricultural sector is also subject to spillovers from the energy sector, in part because \nagriculture  is an energy -intensive industry, but also even more directly through ethanol. Corn \nused for ethanol accounts for  more than a third of U.S. corn production. For perspective,  the \nacreage devoted to  corn destined for ethanol is equivalent to about 50,000 square miles, or 2/3 \nthe area of the state of Nebraska. With demand for ethanol largely dependent on the demand for \ngasoline, fluctuations in gasoline consumption have important implications for the farm \neconomy. As the pandemic compressed gasoline demand, there were immediate spillovers to the agricultural economy, and  demand for ethanol fell off sharply.  \n In addition to the cycl ical lin kages , longer -term trends in energy usage also have \nramifications for the agricultural sector . As motor vehicles have become more fuel efficient, \ndomestic demand for ethanol has flattened out, even as increased exports have cont inued to \nsupport production. Looking farther ahead , quick advances in the technology around electric \nvehicles, as well as aggressive government mandates promoting electric vehicles  in China and \nelsewhere, pose further challenges to the  long- run outlook for  ethanol. Somewhat ironically, the \npush toward electric vehicles is likely a significant threat to  what is currently  one of the largest \nsource s of renewable energy in the United States.   \n Government:  Finances under Threat  \n As energy -dependent states well understand, t he performance of the energy sector also \nsignificantly affects state tax revenues  and spending. Although severance taxes only make up \naround 1 percent of state tax revenues nationally, they play an outsized role in many energy-dependent states. Over the past five years, severance taxes have contributed more than 29  percent  \n\n6 \n of all state tax revenues in Wyoming and more than 45 percent  of revenues in North Dakota and \nAlaska. Even in slightly more economically diversif ied states such as Texas, Oklahoma, West \nVirginia and New Mexico, severance taxes have exceeded 7  percent  of state tax revenues on \naverage.5 \nFor states that rely on severance taxes, these tax streams are typically the most volatile \ncomponent of revenues a nd can lead to large swings in tax collections.6 However, natural \nresource extraction has  also been a blessing for many of these states, allowing them to build up \nlarge reserve funds in many cases.7 \nDuring the current crisis, most states have faced subst antial budget shortfalls as tax \ncollections have fallen in almost every revenue category and pandemic- related government \nspending has risen. In energy states, sharp drops in severance taxes have exacerbated these \npandemic -related budget shortfalls. Thus, s tate governments in energy states are struggling. \nLarge reserve funds can help to offset some of the decline in tax revenues, but most of these states will also be forced to make spending cuts over the next couple of years , likely creating a \nfurther headwind to the recovery.  \nIn the longer term, many state governments in energy states will continue to look for \nways to not only diversify their economies, but also to diversify their revenue streams. This will be particularly important for states that re ly on revenue from commodities that are expected to \nface continued downward pressure over the longer term such as coal and natural gas. As one \nexample, coal lease bonus payments contributed more than $1 billion to school capital \n \n5 U.S. Census Bureau.

With households dependent on gasoline for transportation, changes in oil prices have a direct impact on household budgets.  Higher gasoline prices decrease the amount \nthat can be spent on other goods, which  can be a drag on consumption and the economy. \nSimilarly, lower gasoline prices boost the resources available to buy other goods and have historically supported consumption.  \nHow important a gasoline price shock is to consumers depends on the  share of gasoline in \ntotal expenditures. The lower the share of gasoline in total expenditures, the less important and \nthe less likely that a change in gas prices w ill have a meaningful effect on overall consumption. \nOver time , the amount of household budgets devoted to gasoline has been falling, from about 4 \npercent in the 1980s to only about 2 percent in 2019, suggesting a declining importance of oil price shocks t o overall macroeconomic volatility.\n9  \nThat being said, the declining importance of oil in the aggregate masks considerable \nheterogeneity across the income distribution, with changes in gas prices being notably more important for low -income households. In the lowest -income quantile, gasoline accounted for \nmore than  8 percent of household income in 2019, more than five times the budget share of the \n \n8 http://eadiv.state.wy.us/creg/GreenCREG_Oct20.pdf  \n9 Total gasoline consumption increas ed by about 36% and 25% in the U.S. and the 10th District, respectively, from \nthe 1980s to 2018 (last annual data point for states).  \n\n8 \n highest -income households. However, even for these lowest -income households, gasoline \naccounts for a smaller sh are in spending now than in the past. \nThe COVID -19 shock could further loosen the grip of gasoline prices on consumers ’ \nbudgets  and reduce the already lowered  sensitivity of consumption to changes in the price at the \npump. The pandemic dampened demand for gasoline as the volume of commuting fell off \nsharply with the rise in  unemployment and increase in the number of employees  work ing from \nhome. Gasoline sales in April were off by a third of the ir pre-pandemic level.  While mobility has \nincreased w ith the lifting of stay -at-home restrictions, gasoline remains well below normal \nlevels .10 One  thing that seems unlikely to ever bounce back fully is the amount of  commuting. \nWith many workplaces offering, or likely to offer, increased workplace flexibilit y, not only is \ngasoline demand likely to be lower, but it is also likely to be more elastic.  More elastic demand \n(with the caveat that not all jobs are tele -workable ) should lower the volatility of overall \nconsumption in response to gasoline price shocks.     \n Putting it all together, developments in the energy sector have widespread effects across \nthe economy, both transmitting and amplifying near -term cyclical shifts, but also leading to \nlonger -term s tructural trends.  Energy shapes  the context for economic growth and inflation, in \nboth the near -term and long- run, arguing for monetary policymakers to keep a close eye on \nenergy  dynamics .  \n Monetary Policy’s Influence on the Energy Sector  I will close with some thoughts on the influence of monetary policy on the energy sector. \nTo the extent that direct and indirect spillovers affect the economic outlook, and thus monetary \n \n10 EIA and Affinity Solutions.  \n\n9 \n policy settings, it is worth considering how monetary policy, and particularly the prospect of \nlow-for-long interest rates, might affect the energy sector.  There is a long literature that suggests, \nall else equal, that low interest rates should boost the price of stora ble commodities, such as oil, \npartly by incentivizing greater demand, but also by decreasing the incentive to produce.11 \nConverting oil reserves into currency and other assets is less appealing when the return on alternative assets is low.  In addition, there is a literature that suggests that low rates should lead \nto less -volatile prices.  Interest rates are an important cost of holding inventory, so low rates \nshould lower inventory costs and incentivize larger buffers that can then mitigate unexpected shifts in supply and demand.\n12 Of course there are many oth er factors affecting oil prices beside s \ninterest rates, so low oil prices and continued price volatility can certainly coincide with low -for-\nlong rates.  \n Again relying on “all else equal ,” low rates should incentivize investment  in the energy \nsector , and generally , by decreasing the cost of capital. This could be particularly true in the \nrenewables sector, which has long -lived capital investment with high initial costs similar to \nutilities more generally.  However, low interest rates can work not only by promoting new \nadditions to the capital stock, but also through the acquisition of pre -existing capital—that is by \nencouraging mergers and acquisitions. In an industry with uncertain near -term and long- term \ndemand, it might not be surprising to see low r ates engender a greater response in M&A activity \nand consolidation as opposed to increased capital expenditure.  \n \n11 See Jeffery Frankel \"The Effect of Monetary Policy on Real Commodity Prices\" , Chapter 7  in Asset Prices and \nMonetary Policy , John Campbell, ed.

I will also describe recent revisions to the Federal Reserve’s \napproach to setting monetary policy and how I s ee those changes influencing future policy \nchoices .  \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nThe recovery from the second quarter’s historic fall off in economic activity has been \nmore rapid than expected  by me, by financial markets, and by many of our  business contacts . \nRetail sales have bounced back to pre -pandemic levels and the labor market has made up  \nconsiderable ground, with half of the 22 million jobs that disappeared  in March and April having \nreturned.   \nTwo factors have been particularly impor tant in driving the  recovery. First, the rebound \nin activity reflects an evolution in the mechanisms for responding to the virus , as broadly \nimplemented lockdowns shift towards more targeted restriction s and to an increased willingness \nby the  public to engage in  certain activities. Second, policy support , both fiscal and monetary, \nhas played an essential  role. It is  particularly notable that even as wages and salaries  fell a record \namount  in the second quarter, personal income, which includes transfer payments from the \ngovernment, grew at the fastest pace in U.S. history and reached a new record high.   \nMonetary policy has also played an important part in buffering the effects of the crisis. \nThe Fed responded quickly and aggressively, cutting its benchmark interest rate to near zero, \npurchasing Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities at an unprecedented scale, \nand establishing a number of new credit facilities to promote the flow of credit.   \nWhile the recovery has so far been more pronounced than many expected, its gains have \nnot been evenly distributed, due in part  to the unequal toll the pandemic has  taken across sectors  \nof the economy. Some sectors, such as restaurants , and many other services consumed outside \nthe home , have shown only a partial recovery, with some, such as movie theaters, still virtually \nshut down. Other sectors, including many durable consumption goods, have more than \nrecovered, with home improvements, personal computers, and bicycles all showing considerable \n\n2 \n strength. Low interest rates have undoubtedly boosted the purchase of durable goods and \nunderpinned the continued strength of the housing market.  \nThe unevenness of the recovery is evident  in the labor market  as well . After peaking at \n14.7 percent in April, the unemployment rate fe ll back to 7.9 percent in September ; we are \nmoving in the right direction, even if we still have a way  to go. However, the sharp loss in jobs \nhas been concentrated almost entirely in service -providing industries, normally a relatively stable \npart of the econom y. Particularly hard hit by the initial disruptions were the retail and leisure and \nhospitality industries, though I will note that these sectors have also seen the largest gains in \nsubsequent months. Another aspect of unevenness has been the disproportionate effect of the \ncrisis on women. The unemployment rate for women has moved from being below that of men \ngoing into the  crisis  to now being above .                 \nMany of the same dynamics that have been driving the national economy are at  play here \nin Kansas. After spiking to almost 12 percent in April, the unemployment rate in Kansas has \nsince fallen back to below 7 percent;  better , but still considerably above the less than 3 percent \nrate we saw in March. While most of the lost jobs have been in the services s ector , \nmanufacturing has also taken a hit . This is most apparent in the aerospace sector, an important \nindustry here in Wichita , where employment has fallen 20 percent from March with no signs of \nrecovery . Given the global outlook for air travel and the airline industry, this weakness  could \npersist for some time.  \nThe crisis has also impacted agriculture.  While many segments of the agricultural  \nindustry in Kansas had already been under pressure before the crisis, the pandemic has exacerbated the challenges. The prices of many major agricultural commodities produced in \nKansas are lower today than before the crisis due, in part, to various disruptions connected to the \npandemic. And while government support programs may limit some financial stress this year for  \nKansas farmers , head winds in the sector appear likely to remain, and wil l also depend \nsignificantly on the course of the pandemic.       \nThough I have been encoura ged by the pace of recovery, substantial risks to the outlook \nremain , with two deserving particular attention. First is the virus itself. As the F ederal O pen \nMarket C ommittee (FOMC)  has noted, the path of the economy will depend significantly on the \ncourse of the virus. A resurgence in the virus and the renewed imposition of control measures \nwould likely throw the recovery off track. Already we have seen this dynamic play itself out to \n\n3 \n various degrees in Europe  where cases have spiked again in many countries after falling over the \nsummer . The economy is unlikely to fully recover until the virus no longer interferes with the \npublic’s  day-to-day decision -making. Th at seems ultimately to depend on confidence that the \nvirus can be effectively managed, such as  with a vaccine.   \nSecond, individuals and small businesses have been able to resume economic activity \nthrough substantial  fiscal  support . As the virus persists , and the funding provided to date \ndissipates, the recovery could stall. One sector t hat poses a particular risk is spending by state \nand local governments  that have boosted spending on public health measures, while at the same \ntime experiencing significantly lower tax collections.  With deteriorating budget positions, state \nand local governments are cut ting spending, and have already furloughed and laid off worke rs, \nleading to over a million fewer jobs in the sector relative  to February.   \nIn summary, the recovery has been encouragingly fast, but the risks around the outlook \nare substantial. We are not out of the woods yet.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’ s Framework Review  and the Outlook for Monetary Policy  \nBefore turning to the outlook for monetary policy, I think it is important to provide some \nbackground on the recent revisions to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework. The \nrevisions marked the culmination of a process that was launched  in early 2019, when the Federal \nReserve began a review of how t o best conduct monetary policy in an economic environment  \nthat has undergone  some notable changes in recent decades . While the review pre- dated the \npandemic and was targeted at longer -run structural changes in the economy, the pandemic has \namplified  many of these changes . \nTwo developments in particular have made the conduct of monetary policy more \nchallenging in recent years . First, interest rates have fallen to levels that once seemed almost \nunthinkable, not just in the United States, but around the world. These lower rates have resulted , \nat least in part, from structural changes that have increased the amount that households and \nbusinesses want to save , while at the same time lowering  the amount of desired investment. \nThese changes  include sluggish economic growth, coincident with lagging productivity, and an \naging population. Regardless of the cause, lower interest rates reduce the capacity  of the Federal \nReserve to stimulate the econo my, when necessary , through the  traditional method of lowering \nthe policy interest  rate.     \n\n4 \n The s econd  key development is that  inflation dynamics have shifted such that the link \nbetween the pace of economic activity and inflation appears to have weakened. For some time, \ninflation has remained persistently low, even when the economy appeared to produce above its \npotential . Policymakers have seen that far lower levels of unemployment have been achieved \nwithout triggering inflationary pressures. This shift in inflation dynamics has prompted the \nFederal Reserve to rethink its monetary policy response . \nIt is intuitive that rising prices are viewed negatively by households unsure of how \nquickly, or even if, their own incomes  will be increasing. And certainly,  there is a consensus , \nbacked by considerable historical experience,  that too high inflation is bad for households and \nthe economy.     \nLow inflation on the other hand is generally associated with low interest rates , and low \ninterest rates pose a constraint on the Federal Reserve’s ability to the stabilize the economy . \nFurthermore, low inflation can beget even lower inflation, if households and businesses start to anticipate it and shift down their expectations for inflation in the future. Under such conditions, \ncentral bankers worry t hat inflation expectations and actual inflation could spiral  dangerously \ndownward, further cons training monetary policy. Without the space to cut interest rates, the \nFederal Reserve is likely to have to rely more on asset purchases and other non- interest rate \npolicies to address downturns in the economy. Though these policies have been viewed as effective, they can come at some cost. In particular, balance sheet policies have implications for \nfinancial imbalances , resource misallocation,  and a further expansion of the Fed’s footprint in \nfinancial markets.   \nFaced with a changed economy, the Federal Reserve  changed  its monetary policy \nframework  in two significant aspects . First, the Committee clarified that it w ill accommodate \nlow rates of unemployment. That is to say, policy would not be tightened in response to low unemployment in the absence of signs of sustained upward pressure on inflation. Prior to the \npandemic , unemployment reached historically low levels fo r some time without causing an \nundesirable increase in inflation  and it had become incr easingly clear that defining a precise \nnumber for maximum employment was likely not appropriate . As a result, the FOMC’s \nframework would not call for preempt ing inflation by tightening policy on the basis of tight labor \nmarkets alone.    \n\n5 \n Second, while maintaining its 2 percent inflation target in the longer run, the FOMC will \nnow aim to achieve this objective by targeting an inflation  rate that averages 2 percent over time. \nThus, following periods when inflation has fallen persistently be low 2 percent, the Committee \nwould allow inflation to run above 2 percent for a period of time .   \nWhile the change to average inflation targeting may  seem quite technical, let  me explain \nhow I see this adjustment  affecting our policy decisions . My long- held view  is that i nflation \nrunning a bit under 2 percent or a bit above 2 percent  is consistent with a  longer -run 2 percent \ninflation objective . Given the volatility of inflation, and the imprecision with which it is \nmeasured, I  have generally not been concerned by an inflation  rate a few tenths off target on \neither side of 2 percent. \nBy allowing inflation to move  above 2 percent for some time, the f ramework makes clear  \nthat the 2 percent target is not a ceiling  on inflation. M onetary policy is most effec tive at steering \ninflation at longer horizons. The  2 percent objective  provides the public a guidepost for the long-\nrun. While the new consensus statement elaborates that this 2 percent long- run target is viewed \nthrough the lens of average inflation outcomes, no timetabl e for averaging was specified,  \navoiding a sense of undu e precision over inflation outcomes. Instead, I interpret the revised \nconsensus statement as a tolerance — and less as a promise to engineer — for inflation \nmoderately above 2 percent for some time. Moreover, inflation should, in my view, continue to \nbe vi ewed in the context of broader economic outcomes. Inflation temporarily and moderately \nabove 2 percent is unlikely to warrant a policy response if the economy is otherwise functioning well.  \nThe term “average” has attracted a lot of attention  among the cot tage industry of Fed \nwatchers. From my stand point, I see little benefit in getting too  tied up in a precise mathematical \nformulation of “ average. ” The challenge of adopting a  precise definition of “average” inflation \nhas familiar parallel s to the  challenges of adopting precise monetary policy rules. T here are \nreasons why the FOMC has in the past avoided strict adher ence to monetary policy rules, so it is \nunsurprising that the new framework  is not a precise prescription for policy actions . The \nstructure of th e economy changes over time, as acknowledged by the  framework review, and the \nFOMC’s credibility will come from its  flexibility in adapting to new cir cumstances rather than \nadher ing to a formula.    \n\n6 \n At its September meeting , the FOMC moved t o adjust policy in light of its revised \nframework. In particular, the C ommittee provided forward guidance that it expects to keep the \npolicy rate near zero until inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 \npercent  for some time . I view this guidance as consistent with a message of patience. We are \nsignaling that the committee is unlikely to preemptively tighten  policy at the prospect  that \ninflation is approaching 2 percent , but rather a willingness to wait until the data confirms its \narrival.   \nGiven an unsettled  outlook for inflation, it is not yet clear how much patien ce will be \nrequired . The pandemic has affected prices in a variety of ways, and it will be difficult to ass ess \nthe underlying pace of inflation until the dust settles. While overall inflation has weakened with \nthe pandemic, the decline largely reflects the weight of a few s ectors hard hit by a virus -induced \ncollapse in demand . Many other sectors have seen inflation step up, due to supply disruptions or \nstrong demand. In fact, looking at the change in prices across the individual categories that \ncomprise consumer spending, more categories have recorded higher inflation than lower inflation \nsince the onset of the pandemic. Good news on the virus could quickly boost inflation back to, or  \neven above, 2 percent.   \nHowever, if the pandemic were to unleash a deeper and more prolonged recession, the \ndrag on prices could be more pronounced. The Committee’s recent interest rate guidance would suggest this would lead to a longer period of accommodative policy.       \nWhile the Committee has offered relatively explicit guidance for policy rates, it has so far \nprovided only  minimal guidance on a nother aspect of policy; that is the trajectory of our asset \npurchases, primarily Treasuries and M ortgage B acked S ecurities (MBS) , and its  intentions \nregarding the size and composition of the Fed’s balance sheet. Following disruptions in financial \nmarkets in March, the Fed began purchasing large quantities  of Treasuri es and MBS. These \nactions proved very effective in calming financial markets, even as the pandemic exacted a tremendous toll on the real economy.  \nWith market functioning having largely returned to pre -pandemic conditions, the  \nSeptember policy statement broaden ed the objective of asset purchases to  include fostering \naccommodative financial conditions . It will be important to provide further detailed gui dance on \nthe Committee’s intentions regarding these purchases. This is a matter of transparency and \n\n7 \n accountability, but also an important element of ensuring the effectiveness  of the purchases . I \nlook forward to discussing these issues with my colleagues.  \nEven as the economy continues to recover , the risks that lie ahead  cannot be \nunderestimated . The Federal Reserve has been active in its support of the recovery and we will \ncontinue to monitor the economy’s progress  closely."

I’ll begin by talking for a few minutes about \nthe Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis and some of the immediate issues we saw in the \nbanking sector early on. I will then turn to the importance of community banks throughout this \nperiod. I’ll also offer some considerations on how the pandemic could shape banking going \nforward, with a particular e mpha sis on industry concentration.1 \n \nThe Fed’s Crisis Response  \nThe Covid- 19 pandemic , and the actions required to contain it , have had a profound \nimpact on the U.S. economy and financial system. As the virus spread throughout the country, the economic outlook deteriorated sharply . In March, businesses began to slow production or \nclose their doors and consumers reduced spending, both as they withdrew from economic activity and  to buffer against an impending downturn. These actions, and the  continued \nuncertainty around the virus’s projected path, sparked a full -scale economic recession and \nfinancial panic.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s un precedented actions to support the economy during the \npandemic involved a combination of conventional and unconventional monetary tools and \ndiscount window lending. Borrowing from the Financial Crisis playbook, the Federal Reserve \nissued credit to a number  of financial actors including primary dealers, commercial banks, \nmoney market funds, and special purpose vehicles holding asset -backed securities in order to \nfacilitate the continued flow of credit into the real economy. In an unprecedented step, the \nFede ral Reserve joined with the U.S. Treasury to issue credit to non- financial firms and local \ngovernments. These programs require the Federal Reserve to take on some amount of credit risk, and as such they are backed by an equity stake from the U.S. Treasury.  In addition, the Federal \nReserve purchased sizable amounts of Treasury and mortgage -backed securities to ensure that \ncapital markets continue d to remain liquid and open to investors.  \n                                                      \n1 I thank Rajdeep Sengupta, Blake Marsh and Nick Baker of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for their \nassistance in preparing these remarks.  \n\n2 \n The Federal Reserve ’s actions rely on commercial banks as a conduit to channel funds \ninto the real economy, and we have taken steps to ensure that banks can continue to lend. For \nexample, the U.S. Treasury provided loans to businesses under the Payroll Protection Program \n(PPP) made through partner lending institutions. By taking extraordinary measures to reach  out \nto customers and work with existing borrowers, small banks accounted for 40 percent of the program’s total lending. This surge in lending, however, resulted in reduced balance sheet \ncapacity for participating banks. In response, the Federal Reserve established the PPP liquidity \nfacility , which accepts these loans as collateral in order to free up cash for additional lending.\n2 \nCapital regulations for certain asset classes and loan ty pes were also eased to facilitate Treasury \nmarket functioning and to blunt the balance sheet impact of business lending.  \nOther aspects of the crisis response have also importantly involved banks. The CARES \nAct authorized forbearance programs to ease paymen t pressures on a number of consumer loan \nproducts. Forbearance allows consumers to delay payment of their loans until employment conditions return to more -normal levels and helps banks conserve capital by avoiding \ndelinquencies that become charge -offs down the road. In this aspect, the banking agencies are \ncommitted to working with banks to find acceptable ways to mitigate loan losses throughout the \nremainder of the pandemic. Preserving bank capital and keeping credit flowing throughout the \neconomy is essen tial. \n \nThe Early Impact of the Pandemic on the Banking Sector  \nDuring the early days of the crisis, businesses turned to banks of all sizes in an effort to \nprotect themselves against rising economic and financial stress. Precautionary draws on existing \nlines of credit increased sharply in March as firms tried to cover expected revenue declines. At \nthe same time, deposits flowed into the bankin g system as a flight -to-quality ensued and both \nfirms and investors showed a preference for holding  cash over other financial assets.   \nThe effects of the crisis varied among banks  of different sizes and operating models . \nWhile balance sheets grew quickly across the banking universe, large banks experienced the \nmajority of the loan draws and deposit inflows and, therefore, bore the brunt of the immediate \n                                                      \n2 Community banks have been important users of the PPPLF with 50 percent of current total take up, or $34 bill ion, \nas of August 31, 2020.  \n\n3 \n pandemic -related activity . Smaller banks quickly engaged with borrowers to assess their needs \nand offere d payment deferral.   \nTo date, few stresses have emerged across banks despite the severe economic contraction.  \nThe level of problem assets reported by banks in the second quarter remained at historic lows, \nand c apital buffers, despite declining as balance sheets grew, stayed above regulatory minimums .   \nThe resilience of the banking system certainly reflects stronger capital and liquidity positions \nbuilt up over the last decade.  The response of fiscal and monetary policy to support households \nand business es, along with actions taken by the banking agencies to  offer aspects of supervisory \nand regulatory relief, has undoubtedly muted the impact to banking conditions so far .    \nThe economic recovery, however, is far from complete. S trains on household and \ncommercial balance sheets since March have created fragilities that could yet threaten bank \nprofitability and loss -absorbing capacity for some time. Adequate capital is critically important \nfor the safety and soundness of banks, as well as for the continued provisioning of credit that keeps our financial system and our economy functioning during periods of stress. There is \nwidespread consensus among economists and policymakers that bank capital not only serves as a \nbuffer against unexpected losses and insolvency, but also mitigates excessive risk -taking \nincentives. Higher capital levels reduce the probability of failure and crises, and better capitalized banks can hasten a post -crisis recovery.   \n The Pandemic and Community Banks  \nCommunity banks continue to be central to the health of local communities and \ncollectively to the health of the nation’s economy. This is particularly true for the access to credit \nrequired for small businesses, which have been hit hard by the pandemic. Th ese businesses \nemployed 60 million people or 47 percent of the private workforce in 2016.\n3 As of August, both \nsmall business revenue and employment were down 19 percent since the beginning of the year.4  \nCommunity banks are particularly well -situated to un derstand the needs of small - to \nmedium -sized businesses where local knowledge and lending relationships  exist. These \nrelationships prompted community bankers to reach out and offer assistance to their customers \nearly in the pandemic. It is has also been evident in the launch of the Federal Reserve’s Main \n                                                      \n3 https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp -content/uploads/2019/04/23142719/2019 -Small -Business -Profiles -US.pdf  \n4 https://tracktherecovery.org/  \n\n4 \n Street Loan Facility. Among the  more than 500 registered lenders, the overwhelming majority  \nare community banks. And to date, nearly half of the loans purchased by the facility have been \nextended by community banks . Although t here has been some criticism that this program has not \nbeen more widely utilized , it appears that the program is serving its intended purpose , and \nbroader use of this funding may be a function of specific terms and operational needs .  \nIn responding to the crisis, c ommunity and regional banks have taken prompt action to \nstrengthen balance sheets in light of expected future credit losses. This is evident in the \nbolstering of loan loss reserves i n the first two quarters of this year.5 For many community \nbanks, commercial real estate and agricultural lending are cornerstones of the business model; as such, concentration risk warrants ongoing attention as strained business revenues and commodity \nprices threaten the ability of some borrowers to repay their obligations.\n6 Thus, community \nbankers must remain vigilant.   \nAs you well know, the banking landscape has changed significantly over the past three \ndecades. Industry -wide consolidation over this period has increasi ngly led to the concentration of  \nbanking assets in large banking organizations, with the highest concentration of assets within the eight U.S. banks  known as the G -SIBs , or global systemically important banks . At the turn of the \ncentury,  U.S. G -SIBs held one -third of total banking assets and generated around 40 percent of \nindustry profits. As of year -end 2019, G -SIBs account for 60 percent  of both the banking \nindustry’s assets and its profits. The financial crisis led to a wave of bank fa ilures and mergers \nthat contributed to the ongoing consolidation. Despite the resolution of many failed banks during \nthe crisis (2007- 10), unassisted mergers accounted for more of the increased concentration than \nthe resolution of failed banks.\n7 While it is always difficult to forecast economic trends, \nconsolidation in the banking industry has continued since the mid- 1980s and is likely to continue  \nin the post -pandemic recovery.  \n \n                                                      \n5 Second quarter  2020 data shows substantial provision expense across banks of all sizes.  \n6 Risks also noted in the Federal Reserve’s May 2020 Financial Stability Report: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020 -may -financial -stability -report -purpose.htm   \n7 David C. Wheelock, 2011. \" Banking industry consolidation and market structure: impact of the financial crisis and \nrecession ,\" Review , Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, vol. 93(Nov), pages 419 -438. \n\n5 \n Recent changes to the operating environment in banking are likely to exacerbate this \ntrend of consolidation.  Most economists and policymakers believe that bec ause of differences in \nsize, interconnectedness, complexity, and cross -jurisdictional activity, larger banks should hold \nrelatively more capital than their smaller counterpar ts.  And yet, despite the lessons of the \nfinancial crisis and as mentioned previously, critical capital ratios at community banks have been \npersistently higher than that at the largest banks.8  Community banks entered this extreme shock \nwith leverage capital at a 20 -year high and a collective leverage ratio 270 basis points above that \nof the GSIBs.9 This capital advantage undoubtedly affects the competitive environment for \ncommunity banks. Moreover, recent regulatory changes intended to provide signifi cant capital \nrelief to the largest banks not only raise concerns about financial stability but also could further \nwiden the difference in capital ratios between small and large banks. C apital regulation is \ncreating incentives for banks to grow significantl y larger.  \nCommunity banks have also noted the challenges they face with persistently low interest \nrates as  another important factor in this operating environment. While low -for-long interest rates  \nnegatively affect net interest margins for all banks , margin compression puts community banks at \na disadvantage relative to large banks because it is their principal source of income. In contrast, large banks can rely on alternative sources of (noninterest) income such as trading revenues and \nintermediation fees to offset any decrease in interest margins. From the standpoint of community \nbanks, the large bank model that relies on transactional lending and fee -based income while \nholding relatively less capital becomes increasingly attractive. In short, both regulation and monetary policy appear to be tilting the scales in favor of large banks.  \nSome argue that efforts to ease capital requirements are necessary to support the \nprovision of credit to individuals and businesses. I do not find this argument compelling. The \nFederal Reserve’s most recent Senior Loan Officer Lending Survey indicated that no large banks \nconsidered their current or expected capital position a “very important” reason in their \ndetermination of credit standards.\n10 Additionally, large banks benefiting from this change have \nmade significant distributions to shareholders since the pandemic began. These large banks \n                                                      \n8 The Federal Reserve Bank o f Kansas City publishes a horizontal comparison of capital adequacy among banking  \norganizations with different risk profiles: https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/bankingandpayments/bca .  \n9 Ibid.   \n10 July 2020 Senior Loan Officer Survey: https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos -202007.htm .  \n\n6 \n distributed more than $50 billion of capital through shareholder dividends and share repurchases \nin the f irst six months of this year, representing the equivalent of nearly $1 trillion in balance \nsheet capacity.11  \nTo be sure, regulatory relief during this pandemic likely has played a role in ensuring that \nbanks are able to continue to serve as financial inter mediaries. But once the crisis has passed, \nmaintaining robust capital levels at the largest banks will be essential to the nation’s economic \nand financial stability  and to the long -term health of a diverse banking system . \nThere are of course other factors , beyond  regulatory incentives,  behind banking \nconsolidation trends. Transformational changes in information technology and payments systems \nalso have been important forces that have yielded significant efficiency gains from consolidation, \nespecially in the early years after branching deregulation in the mid- 1990s. This consolidation, of \ncourse, raises concerns. With policies favoring a banking model that relies on transactional lending and fee -based incomes, a traditional model of banking that relies on len ding relationships \nand local knowledge faces pressure. Numerous studies, including research on the F inancial \nCrisis, have shown that, despite the technology and efficiency gains, abandoning the traditional \nmodel has often yielded worse lending outcomes.\n12  \nExtending broad access to payment systems has long been an objective of the Federal \nReserve. As scale and network effects begin to dominate the landscape for instant payment methods, community and regional banks have expressed a desire to provide access to their \ncustomers. To facilitate access to faster payments, the Federal Reserve will provide a new \npayment service called FedNow , providing public benefits related to the safety, efficiency, and \naccessibility of instant payments, specifically through its ab ility to reach more than 10,000 of the \ncountry’s diverse depository institutions , including community banks and rural customers. The \npandemic itself has highlighted the need for this capability to expedite payments as the \ngovernment issued Economic Impact Payments to millions of Americans.  \n  \n                                                      \n11 Distribution data contained in second quarter financial reports.  $1 trillion is an estimate using a 15x multiple \n(5% minimum = 3% SLR minimum + 2% Leverage buffer to avoid distribution limitations).  \n12 See, for example, Patrick Bolton & Xavier Freixas & L eonardo Gambacorta & Paolo Emilio Mistrulli, 2016. \n\"Relationship and Transaction Lending in a Crisis, \" Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies, vol. \n29(10), pages 26 43-2676.  \n\n7 \n Conclusion  \n  The fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic has been extraordinary , and the \nbanking industry has played an essential role i n supporting this response and providing credit to \nhouseholds and business. Community banks in particular have been indispensable in maintaining \naccess to credit for small business and in doing so have served the needs of local communities as \nwell as contributed to the nation’s economi c recovery. To be sure, the banking industry must \nnavigate the path to economic recovery , and community banks face the particular challenges of \nindustry concentration and consolidation. Finding ways to address these challenges will shape \nthe diversity of t he nation’s banks and t he crucial role they play as catalysts of the recovery."

In my discussion, I will review the tremendous hit to the economy inflicted by the \ncoronavirus, before highlighting some recent indicators that suggest a recovery is underway , \nincluding across the seven states of the Tenth Federal Reserve District that is served by the \nKansas City Fed. This is a region that spans much of the central plains from western Missouri through Colorado, Wyoming and northern New Mexico . I will then discuss the extraordin ary \npolicy response, both fiscal and monetary, that is underlying this recovery , closing with a \ndiscussion of the economic outlook, and the implications of that outlook for monetary policy .  \nThe past few months have been a challenging t ime for our economy and our  nation. The \ncoronavirus pandemic has led to a public health emergency unlike any in modern times . \nMeasures taken to control the virus have delivered an unprecedented shock to economic activity, both nationally and in the Tenth D istrict.  \nThe economy  enter ed recession in February, with real output falling 5 percent in the first \nquarter of the year , the most significant decline since late 2008, and a widespread expectation \nthat activity will decline at a record pace in the second quarter . A tremendous number of \nAmericans have lost their jobs  since March , pushing the unemployment rate up from one of its \nlowest levels in half a century to the highest reading s in the post -war era  in just a matter of \nmonths .  \nThe coronavirus  recession  has some unique elements . Modern r ecessions have typically \nresulted from imbalances within the  economy that become unstable over time, either as \neconomic demand exceeds supply leading to a buildup in inflation or as financial imbalances unwind after an unsustainable build up. H owever, the coronavirus shock cam e from outside the \neconomy . An otherwise healthy economy  was more or less put into a medically induced  coma to \n\n2 \n protect the public ’s health  with policies that allowed only businesses deemed essential to remain \nopen.  \nThe nature of the measures taken to combat the coronavirus also have differentiated the \ncurrent recession from past recessions . The need for social distancing has taken a particularly \nheavy toll on the consumption of services . The services  sector is often relatively stable in a \ndownturn;  this time services are leading the decline.   \n \nLABOR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  \nOne consequence of the services -led downturn has been that certain parts of the labor \nmarket have been  hit harder than others. Almost two -thirds  of the 22 million jobs  lost in March \nand April were concentrated in three broad industries: leisure and hospitality, education and \nhealth services, and retail trade. The vast majority  of the 8 million layoffs in leisure and \nhospitality was concentrated in  highly socially interactive  sectors, including accommodation s, \nrestaurants  and bars . Within education and health services, dentist and physician offices cut \nmany workers,  as did day care providers . While we saw strong job gains in these industries in \nMay,  with employment increasing by 2 million jobs,  a full recovery is still far off .  \nIt is notable that, partly as a consequence of the sectoral distribution of layoffs , different \ndemographic groups, though all suffering large declines in employment, have bee n affected to \nvarying degrees . The increase in the unemployment rate has been particularly pronounced for \nHispanic workers, increasing from 4.4 percent in February to 17.6 percent in May . African -\nAmerican workers have also seen a large increase in unemploy ment, from 5.8 percent in \nFebruary to 16.8 percent in May . It is also concerning that , unlike most demographic groups, the \nunemployment rate for  African -Americans showed no improvement in May relative to April  \n\n3 \n even as the overall economy added millions of jobs . Similar to previous recessions, younger \nworkers also have been  especially hard hit by job losses .  \nA particular feature of the current recession is that  women have  suffered disproportionate  \njob losses, in contrast to their relative performance in the  typical recession .1 Women held more \njobs in the hardest -hit industries and a majority of these women did not have a college degree. \nConsequently, the unemployment rate of non- college -educated  women rose more than  fourfold \nfrom 4.5 percent in Fe bruary to almost 21  percent in April, a far larger increase than experienced \nby men with similar educational background . A similar imbalance was also observed for college -\neducated men and women, though to a slightly lessor degree . Overall, women went from having \nan unemployment rate below their male counterparts in February to a far higher rate after the \ncoronavirus shock.  \n \nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT S \nAlthough every part of the United States experienced dramatic decreases in activity, \nstates in the Tenth District have fared slightly better , likely due to the lower case counts \nexperienced in the region .2 All the same, more than 21 percent of the Tenth District labor force \nhas filed for unemployment benefits since mid -March , with employment in the leisure and \nhospitality sector recording a dramatic 44 percent decline in the region . \n More recently, as stay -at-home orders and other restrictions on activity have been lifted \nwe have started to see signs of recovery, both in the Tenth District and nationally . Because there \n                                                           \n1 Didem Tuzemen and Thao Tran. 2020. “ Women Take a Bigger Hit in the First Wave of Job Losses due to COVID -\n19.” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Economic Bulletin , April 16.  \n2 For further detail  on the economic effects of the pandemic,  see Jason Brown and Alison Felix . 2020. “COVID -19 \nStuns U.S. and Tenth District Economies, but Both Show Signs of Stabilization .” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, Economic Bulletin , June 17.  \n\n4 \n is a lag in the official data , economists at the Kansas City Fed and elsewhere have been \nmonitoring more timely, but less traditional, indicators of activity . One of these measures is f oot \ntraffic to businesses . Foot traffic in mid -April was down  60 percent relative to early March in \nboth the U.S. and the Tenth District.  Traffic began to improve by late April, and has picked up \nslightly faster in the Tenth District, where stay -at-home orders were lifted earlier . As of early \nJune, foot traffic rela tive to the  first week in March was down about  25 percent in the District \nversus 35 pe rcent for the nation as a whole, still depressed but a considerable improvement \nrelative to where we were in April.  \n \nTHE FISCAL POLICY RESPONSE  \nThe pick -up that we have seen has been importantly supported by some  of the  swiftest \nand most aggressive fiscal policy  actions on record. In March and April, Congress enacted four \nbills related to the current pandemic and economic crisis , providing an esti mated  $2.9 trillion of \nfiscal support to the economy, including one -time direct payments to households, an expansion \nof unemployment benefits, forgivable loans to small businesses, and support for new Federal \nReserve lending facilities.3 These fiscal measures are unprecedented not only in terms of the ir \nsize, but also in terms of how rapidly they were enacted . As a comparison, following the 2008 \nfinancial crisis, Congress provided a total of $2.5 trillion of fiscal support to the economy, enacted over a two -year span from 2008 to 2010.  \nSo far, i ncreased transfer payments from the government, including importantly both \ndirect payments and increased unemployment benefits, have covered the loss of income for many \n                                                           \n3 The CARES Act allows employers and  self-employed people to defer Social S ecurity taxes from March 2020 \nthrough December 2021. The CBO estimates that the federal government will reduce revenues over 2020 -21, but \nincrease revenues over 2022 -23. Including this deferral, while excluding the estimated revenue increases over \n2022- 23, brings the total  fiscal package  to $3.6 trillion.  \n\n5 \n households . As a result, eco nomy -wide  disposable income actually incr eased in April despite a \nsharp fall in wage income . However, the coronavirus  is affecting household economic prospects \ndifferently, often depending on how easily jobs can be transitioned to a remote work \nenvironment . Relatively secure and highly  paid  jobs are most often the easiest jobs to make \nremote, while relatively low -paying jobs are overwhelmingly less amenable to remote delivery.  \n \nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE’S POLICY RESPONSE  \nThe Federal Reserve has also responded quickly and aggressively to the developing \ncoronavirus crisis . Credit conditions tightened at an unprecedented pace  as the pandemic spread \nand states and local jurisdictions began to issue shelter -in-place and quarantine orders. Economic \nstrains apparent i n early March developed into a fully -realized financial panic weeks later when \ninvestors fled risk y assets resulting in sharp asset price declines, increased debt spreads, and \nnotable deterioration in market liquidity. Commercial banks experienced draws on existing lines \nof credit, shadow banks saw  funding runs, and short -term corporate debt issuance stalled as \ninvestors flocked to the safety and liquidity of cash and shorter maturity government securities. Even conditions in markets typically considered sa fe-haven s, such as longer -dated Treasuries  \nand agency guaranteed mortgage -backed securities, became strained.\n4  \nThe severity of the liquidity crisis threatened to exacerbate the economic contraction \nfrom the pandemic, prompting a forceful response from the  Federal Open Market Committee \n(FOMC). On March 3, the FOMC reduced its benchmark rate 50 basis points in response to burgeoning economic stress before ultimately cutting the target rate to zero a few weeks later due to rising financial strains. Credit con ditions finally began to ease around March 23 after the \n                                                           \n4 Karlye Dilts Steadman, 2020. “Measuring Liquidity Risk in Treasury Markets: The G -Spread” Economic Bulletin, \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, forthcoming.  \n\n6 \n FOMC announced purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage -backed securities in \nthe amounts needed to facilitate orderly market functioning , and established new credit facilities \nto promote the flow of credit. \nIn addition to FOMC actions, liquidity facilities administered by the Federal Reserve \nhave helped to further ease financial conditions and improve market functioning. Commercial \nbanks, for example, have been encouraged to borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window  to maintain the flow of credit in the face of increased demand by businesses . At the \nsame time, the Federal Reserve has established a number of temporary liquidity facilities that make short -term loans against safe colla teral to address illiquidity at nonbanks.\n5 These \ntemporary facilities are largely guided by the Federal Reserve's 2007 -09 crisis -era experience, \nthough their scope has been expanded to include a wider variety of accepted collateral and a larger number of e ligible participants. Domestically, these facilities aim to ensure credit remains \navailable to U.S. businesses and local governments. For example, the Federal Reserve has intervened directly in the commercial paper market to facilitate the flow of short- term credit to \ncorporations. Globally, the Federal Reserve has established swap lines with other central banks so that U.S. dollar funding is widely available abroad.  \nThe sudden nature of the coronavirus shock, however, presents unique and unprecedented \nfinancial challenges for businesses and local governments. While the Federal Reserve’s initial \nresponses eased short -term funding stresses, additional actions were required to address longer -\nterm concerns. In a signif icant departure from the 2007- 09 crisis -era policy, the Federal Reserve \njoined the U.S. Treasury, as authorized under the CARES Act, to provide temporary relief to \nlocalities and businesses to offset revenue losses. Examples include programs that lend directly \n                                                           \n5 Rajdeep Sengupta & Fei Xue, 2020. \" The Global Pandemic and Run on Shadow Banks ,\" Economic Bulletin , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, issue May 11, 2, pages 1 -5, May.  \n\n7 \n to smaller businesses with limited ac cess to external capital markets, programs that provide \nliquidity to financial institutions participating in the Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program, \nand direct intervention in corporate bond, corporate loan, and local government bond markets.6 \nThese lo nger-term interventions require the Federal Reserve to take on more credit risk than that \nassumed by short -term liquidity facilities, and, as such, are backed by an equity stake from the \nU.S. Treasury, which  will absorb any losses. To the extent that these  funds can assist businesses \nand local governments in maintaining their operations , however, they help lay the foundation for \na quicker recovery once the pandemic abates.  \nSo far, Federal Reserve actions appear successful. Markets are largely functio ning in an \norderly fashion and debt spreads are near pre -pandemic levels  for highly rated  borrowers . \nMoreover, utilization rates at some liquidity facilities and the discount window have declined, while market activity has resumed, suggesting that liquidity condi tions have improved.  \n  \nTHE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  \n The improvement in financial conditions should further support a rebound in economic \nactivity backed by fiscal support and a further relaxation of virus -related restrictions , however, \nthere are a number of risks that could hold up the r ecovery .  \nMost important is the course of the virus itself . A renewed upsurge in infections and \nresumed social distancing, either mandatory or voluntary, is likely to be a persistent risk, at least until a vaccine has been developed  or treatment options sufficiently improve.  \n Putting aside the direct effects of the virus, there are other elements of the health crisis \nthat are likely to prolong the recovery . One risk is that consumer s and businesses react to the new \n                                                           \n6 Huixin Bi & Jacob Dice & Chaitri Gulati & W. Blake  Marsh, 2020. \" Understanding the Recent Rise in Municipal \nBond Yields ,\" Economic Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 27.  \n\n8 \n uncertainty introduced by the virus  by pulling  back on consumption and investment with the goal \nof building precautionary buffers  against future disruptions . While rational at the individual \nlevel , such a pullback can hampe r growth across the wider economy .  \n Another risk comes from the global economy . Foreign demand for U.S. exports had \nalready been weak for some time before the crisis . Now, with the virus rolling across foreign \neconomies at varying times and intensities, it seems unlikely that we should expect much support \nfrom overseas as our economy picks back up.  \n Finally, while fiscal policy is currently providing substantial support for growth, there is \na risk that the impetus from fiscal policy will turn negative be fore the recovery has been fully \nrealized . The coronavirus pandemic has created serious financial consequences for state and \nlocal governments, which  unlike the federal government, must balance their budgets. In the near \nterm, governments are facing liquid ity challenges, as many tax deadlines have been postponed, \nleading to massive drops in income tax collections this spring. Also, s helter -in-place orders have \nsharply reduced consumer spending, thereby lowering sales tax collections. At the same time that \nstate revenues are under pressure, the demand for state services, including spending on medical \nsupplies and temporary health facilities, is growing . Although funding from the CARES Act , \nwhich allocated $150 billion in direct aid to state and local governme nts, including over $11 \nbillion for states in the Tenth D istrict,  will help states cover some of  the costs associated with \nCovid- 19 and partially fill budget gaps in the short term, strains are likely to intensify . Indeed, \nmany states are already making difficult decisions about spending cuts as they finalize budgets \nfor the next fiscal year.  \nIn the longer term, governments will experience large revenue declines that are likely to \nlead to significant budget cuts for years to come . Likewise, the current cr isis is likely to further \n\n9 \n stress the funding of government pension plans, as contributions will likely come under pressure \nand investment returns decline sharply . Even as some economic indicators are starting to \nimprove, evidence from previous recessions s uggests that the economic effects of the \ncoronavirus shock on state and local governments may take some time to fully materialize and may persist even as health risks dissipate.\n7   \n \nOUTLOOK FOR POLICY  \nHow does th is economic outlook shape my views on the appropriate stance of monetary \npolicy?  One thing to note is that d etermining the correct  path for policy is likely to be even more \ndifficult than usual given what I expect to be the continued volatility of the incoming data . \nIndicators are expected t o improve  in the third quarter even as the level of activity remains \ndepressed . Overall, it might be awhile before the dust settles and we gain insight  on whether \nfurther accommodation is necessary or not .  \nAs the economy’s reopening progresses, we should get more clarity about the impact of \nthe actions we’ve taken, as well as the impact of fiscal stimulus . I am also realistic that the \nextraordinary uncertainty about the path of the pandemic over the second half of the year and the \neconomic outlook will require a fair amount of patience and wisdom as we navigate the likely long-lasting implications of the coronavirus shock.  \n \n \n                                                           \n7 See Alison Felix , 2020. \" COVID -19 Challenges State and Local Government Finances .\" Economic Bulletin , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City,  May 13."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n          \n \n \nMarch 6, 2020  \nThe Shadow Open Market Committee  \nNew York, N.Y.  \n \n    \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.  \n  \n\n \n \n1 \n I appreciate this opportunity to pay tribute to Marvin Goodfriend and his many \ncontributions to the theory and practice of monetary policy.1 At the Kansas City Fed, we knew \nMarvin as a scholar and a good Federal Reserve colleague. Marvin also was a participa nt in a \nnumber of our Jackson Hole Economic Symposiums . As a Research Officer at the Richmond \nFed, he attended the first symposium that we h eld in Jackson Hole , Wyoming, in 1982, where his \nwork on “Discount Window Borrowing, Monetary Control, and the Post -October 6, 1979 \nFederal Reserve Operating Procedures” was widel y cited.2 Thirty -four years later i n 2016, as a \nprofessor at Carnegie Mellon, he presented a paper making the case for deeply negative interest \nrates  as a policy tool  that could breach the zero lower bound on nominal rates. He argued that \n“the zero interest bound encumbrance on monetary policy should be removed so that movements \nin the intertemporal terms of trade can be reflected fully in interest rate policy to sustain price stability and full employment with a minimum of inefficient and c ostly alternative policies  \n[emphasis  added] .”\n3  \nWilling to challenge conventional views, Marvin expressed concern that “c entral banks \n[would]  be tempted to rely even more heavily on balance sheet policy in lieu of interest rate \npolicy, in effect exerting s timulus by fiscal policy means via distortionary credit allocation, the \nassumption of credit risk and maturity transformation, all taking risks on behalf of taxpayers and all moving central banks ever closer to destructive inflationary finance.”   He unders tood the \nassociated heartburn of this view, acknowledg ing that negative interest rates was an idea that \nwould likely require “some getting used to.” He not ed, however, that the public also was initially \n                                                 \n1 I thank Kansas City Fed Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n2 Later published in the Journal of Monetary Economics , September 1983, pp. 343- 56. \n3 Marvin Goodfriend, “The Case for Unencumbering Interest R ate Policy at the Zero Lower Bound,” Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, 2016, pp. 127- 160. \nhttps://www.kansa scityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016goodfriend.pdf?la=en \n\n \n \n2 \n resistant to leaving the gold standard, and later to floating the exchange rate, but gradually \naccepted these changes.   \nWhile the use of negative interest rates gives me pause as a way to address a future \nencounter with the effective lower bound, I share Marvin’s concerns about the potential side \neffects of balance s heet policies that pose risks to financial stability and threaten the central \nbank’s policy independence.   \nAs a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in 2013, I \nexpressed my concerns about  the continuation of the asset purchase program  known popularly as \nQE3. By then, financial markets were stable and the economy was growing. These concerns \nabout the expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions echoed many of Marvin’s \nconcern s. In my view, the possible unintended side eff ects of the ongoing asset purchases posed \nrisks to economic and financial stability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future \nmonetary policy .4 Today, however, it is  conventional wisdom that the benefits of asset purchases \nhave been clearly est ablished and that their potential costs have proven negligible.  History and \nfurther research may ultimately affirm that wisdom, but it remains less than clear to me that the \nlonger -run costs of balance sheet policies have been fully  taken into account. \nAs a consequence of large- scale asset purchases, for example, the FOMC had to evaluate \nand reconsider its longstanding operating framework. Given the abundant reserves associated with its  balance sheet policies, the FOMC had  to consider whether  the federal  funds rate target \ncould be achieved administratively by setting the int erest rate on excess reserves. Indeed, t o \nensure effective interest rate control and establish a firm floor on overnight rates, a n overnight \n                                                 \n4 Esther George, “Fed Balance Sheet 101,” Remarks to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Forum, \nDenver, Colorado, July 2017. https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2017/2017- george -\ndenver -07-12.pdf  \n\n \n \n3 \n reverse repo facility  was created .  In addi tion, as the Fed began to shrink its  balance sheet, it \nproved challenging to gauge  the minimum reserve balances needed for achieving the  federal \nfunds rate target  without intervention by the open market d esk at the New York Fed. As a result, \nthe desk resu med regularly conducting repo operations and outright purchases of Treasuries to \nbuild a bigger buffer and ensure an ample  supply of  reserves. These operations have caused some \nconfusion in markets as some participants have seen them —incorrectly, in my vie w—as a type \nof quantitative easing.  \n More generally , to the extent that large -scale asset purchases succeeded in their aim of \ncreating a wealth effect , they also played some role in contribut ing to e levated asset valuations .  \nThese effects,  together with the perception that interest rates will remain at historically low \nlevels for a prolonged period, can lead to a buildup of financial imbalances that ultimately pose \nrisks to the real economy. Experience has shown that these imbalances can develop in sector s \noutside the lens of regulators and, as we witnessed a decade ago, can unwind with little warning.  \nAnother concern I share with Marvin is the risk that income from the Fed’s  large balance \nsheet combine d with our  capital surplus could tempt fiscal authorities to  view the Fed as a source \nof funding for government programs.  I would argue that we have seen a degree of th is risk \nunfold.  T he funding of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) , as required under the \nDodd- Frank Act, is a case in point.  E ach quarter the Reserve Banks transfer to the CFPB, \nwithout Congressional appropriations, the amount of funds requested by the Director of the \nCFPB to carry out its operations . To date, the Federal Reserve has transferred almost $4.4 billion \nto the CFPB.  In addition, the Dodd- Frank Act required the Fed to fund the first two years of the \nOffice of Financial Research in support of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  \n\n \n \n4 \n Yet another example of c ongress ional funding of programs outside the regular \nappropriations process is the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act .”  In the \nFAST Act, Congress funded highway construction by reducing the Federal Reserve Bank stock \ndividend rate for member banks with assets of more than $10 billion. The Act  also placed a cap \nof $10 billion on the aggregate surplus funds of the Federal Reserve and directed that any excess \nbe transferred to the Treasury general fund.  The potential policy implications of modifying \ndividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to purchase \nstock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank, is a concerning development that risks undermining \nthe Federal Reserve’s long -standing institutional design of public and private interests serving \nthe American public.5 \nTo ensure the central bank maintains surplus capital against prospective exposures on a \nbalance sheet inflated  by large scale asset purchases, Marvin  argued that the central bank must \nhave independent authority to retain its net interest earnings to build surplus capital . Without \nsuch capital, the “carry trade” exposure from the balance sheet would “[jeopardize] the \noperational credibility of monetary policy for price stability.”6 \nFinally, Marvin was adamant that central bank  independence was essential for  the \ncredibility and effectiveness of monetary policy.  In testimony before Congress, Marvin said:  \n“Flexibility and decisiveness are essential for effective central banking.  Independence \nenables a central bank to react promptly to macroeconomic or financ ial shocks without \nthe approval of the Treasury or legislature.  Central bank initiatives must be regarded as \n                                                 \n5 Esther L. George, “Structure, Governance, Representation: Federal Reserve Member Banks and Federal Reserve \nBank Stock,” July 2016. https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/speeches/2016/structure -governance -\nrepre sentation.pdf  \n6 Marvin Goodfriend, “Monetary Policy as a Carry Trade,” IMES Discussion Paper Series  No. 2014- E-8, Bank of \nJapan, September 2014. \nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/596b/3815fb45d8fd6fd7b7c1b4a2fc6dacb0b04d.pdf?_ga=2.188435944.190354274\n6.1581107605- 2138291141.1581107605  \n\n \n \n5 \n legitimate by the legislature and the public, otherwise such initiatives will lack credibility \nessential for the ir effectiveness. ”7 \n \nFurthermore, to maintain independence, policymakers must draw a bright line between monetary \nand fiscal policy actions . He said:  \n“The problem is to identify the limits of independence on monetary policy and credit \npolicy to preserve a workable, sustainable division of responsibilities between the central \nbank and the fiscal authorities —the legislature and Treasury.”8 \n \nArguably , this bright line faded in November 2008 when the Federal Reserve announced \nits first round of large -scale asset purchases consisting of  $100 bil lion of agency debt securities \nand $500 billion of agency mortgage -backed securities (MBS).  This program was expanded in  \nMarch 2009 with the planned purchase of a total of $1.25 trillion in MBS, $200 billion in agency \ndebt, along with $300 billion in long er-term Treasury securities.  Additional “open- ended” \npurchases of MBS were announced under the third round of LSAP s in September 2012.  Today \nthe Federal Reserve holds almost $1.4 billion in MBS on its balance sheet , and  the FOMC has \nindicated th at it cur rently does not anticipate selling agency mortgage -backed securities as part \nof its  policy normalization process .  These holdings arguably blur the line between monetary \npolicy and credit allocation. \nTo address th is important distinction , Marvin proposed that the 1951 Treasury -Federal \nReserve Accord on monetary policy be supplemented with a Treasury -Fed Accord on credit \npolicy. He identified three key principles: First, as a long -run matter, a significant, sustained \ndeparture from a “Treasuries on ly” asset acquisition policy is incompatible with Fed \n                                                 \n7 Marvin Goodfriend , “The Case for a Treasury -Federal Reserve Accord for Credit Policy,” Testimony before the \nSubcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade of the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Washington, D.C. March 2014. \nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/896e/65a69106282deb5806c03da136c026d42176.pdf  \n8 Ibid. \n\n \n \n6 \n independence. Second, the Fed should adhere to “Treasuries only” except for occasional, \ntemporary, we ll-collateralized ordinary last- resort lending to solvent, supervised depository \ninstitutions.  And t hird, Fed credit i nitiatives beyond ordinary last -resort lending should be \nundertaken only with prior agreement of the fiscal authorities, and only as bridge loans accompanied by take- outs arranged and guaranteed in advance by the fiscal authorities.  \nThese principles are worth considering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next \nencounter with the zero lower bound. T he Federal Reserve’s ongoing  review  of its monetary \npolicy strategy, tools, and communications  necessarily has surfaced  a number of possibl e \napproaches to address such a future encounter.  Among the possibilities are things  we have tried \nin the past , such as asset purchases and forward guidance .  Other ideas have been more novel , \nsuch as average inflation targeting, yield curve control and, y es, even negative interest rates.   \nMarvin may be right that these things , particularly when they are controversial, take some \ngetting used to.  But as importantly, he was keenly focused on preserving the central bank’s \nintegrity and independence at the same time.  That perspective undoubtedly would serve us well \ntoday."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n       \n            \n \n \nFebruary 10, 2020  \nThe Volcker Alliance Roundtable  \nWashington, D.C. \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers, or representatives. \n  \n\n1 \n Technology and innovation have a long history of joining forces to disrupt e xisting \nconventions . We certainly see this dynamic playing out in today ’s financial system as it relates to \nhow we think about money and its role in facilitating payments . While  digital currencies —the  \nsubject of t his program —ha ve modern features , the public policy questions associated with \nprivate ly issued  currencies  are familiar ones  in a historical context .   \nWell before the Federal Reserve’s creation in 1913, the United States had already been \nthrough multiple periods of what might be considered “financial experimentation .” In the earl y \n1800s, a time when our nation’s western boundary barely reached the Mississippi River, \nhundreds of commercial banks were issuing their own unique currencies .1 This era of wildcat \nbanking prevailed for nearly three full decades with  banks iss uing even more poorly backed and \nsuspect currency.  In this period, currency values could fluctuate wildly and created a n \nimpediment to commerce for both sides of a transaction;  the good or service being purchased as \nwell as the currency used in payment cou ld be vulnerable to negotiation.  \nStill, the motivation for creating many of these early private currencies was in response to \ndemand from a population seeking access to a medium of exchange  that would improve the flow \nof commerce. In fact, t he demand for private money remained in place even after the founding of \nthe Federal Reserve, as national bank notes and Federal Reserve notes co -existed in circulation \nfor se veral decades. This experience was true in other countries as well.    \nToday’s landscape is diff erent in many respects from the wildcat era. But the questions \nfacing policymakers strike me as having similar refrains.   \n                                                      \n1 Clark M. St. Clair and Hall, D.A. eds. “Documentary History of the Bank of the United States.” Gales and Seaton, \n1832. P. 632.  Note that these remarks were made around 1816.  \n\n2 \n In my remarks this afternoon, I’ll highlight the features of the current payments landscape \nthat drive the private sector ’s digital currency solutions. Th is landscape also is  prompting central \nbanks to respond, and in this regard, I’ll talk about the Federal Reserve’s approach.    \nThis is a good time to remind you that the views I express here are my own, and not \nnecessarily t hose of the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nWhat Problems are Digital Currencies Trying to Solve? \nNew privately issued digital currencies  seek  to bring money into  the digital world  with \nimprovements in speed and cost, and with the scale and scope to provide broad access. The \nability to send money with the speed and convenience of an email message is appealing and understandably gaining rapid adoption.   \nFirst, let’s discuss speed . The Federal Reserve has heard from the industry for a number \nof years that  payments need to be faster . However, o ne of the reasons processes have not been \nupdated is that the underlying infrastructure i s not designed to be instantaneous . As a result, it \ncan take up to a few days for someone  to receive funds in a pers onal account , regardless as to \nwhether the payment was by check, ACH, card , or one of the increasingly popular payment apps . \nThis can be especially problematic for many  Americans who are living paycheck -to-paycheck . It \nalso matters to small businesses and their ability to manage cash flow.   \nThe cost of payments is another pain point  that is potentially amplified by multiple \nintermediaries in a payments transaction . For example,  some providers of digital currencies \nhighlight what they view as excessive interchange fees —an  issue we at the Kansas City Fed have \nbeen studying for more than  15 years —as a reason that merchants may  be interested in  adopt ing \n\n3 \n this new medium of exchange  over current systems .2 According to a 2019 Nilson Report, U.S. \nmerchants collectively paid fees of $ 108 billion to accept credit, debit, and prepaid cards in \n2018.3 The majority of th ese were interchange fees.  \nThe reach of payment capabilities also is an important aspect of to day’s landscap e. \nGlobalization has led to an increase in cross -border payments . Yet because infrastructure,  \ncurrency,  standards, laws and regul ations are domestic and not international, there are many  \nefficiency and coordination challenges  with cross -border payments . As a result, the location and \njurisdiction of payment participants matters , and raises the question of whether digital currencies \ncan address these challenges .   \nFinally, digital currencies have been touted as better facilitating access to the financial \nsystem for the unbanked population. This is an issue that brings to mind  that paper currencies in \nColonial America were developed as something of a proxy for the gold or silver that the British \nlargely kept out of the c olonies. Colonists, unable to access the specie used for commerce in \nmuch of the rest of the developed world, began to develop their own rudimentary system. In it \nwere bills that could be redeemed fo r some amount of another item —for example, the \nContinental Congress issued bills that could be  redeemed for Spanish dollars. For coloni sts, this \nwas one way —although perhaps not t he best or most efficient way —of addressing issues of \naccess.  \nAccording  to the World Bank, 1.7 billion people still do not have access to useful and \naffordable financial p roducts and services . As commerce and payments have become more \n                                                      \n2 See, for example, Hayashi, F . (2004) “ A Puzzle of Card Payment Pricing: Why Are Merchants Still Accepting \nCard Payments? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Payments System Research Working Paper, WP 04 -02. The \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  hosted an international payments policy conference entitled “ Interchange Fees \nin Credit and Debit Card Markets: What Role for Public Authorities? ” in 2005.  \n3 Nilson Report, Issue 1155, June 2019.  \n\n4 \n digital ized, those who rely solely on physical cash for transactions may run the risk of limiting \nthe transactions they can conduct.  \n \nWhat are the Problems  Associated with these I nnovations ?  \nEach of t hese are legitimate problems that digital currencies seem well suited  to address . \nYet we can’t overlook that despite efforts to make payments fast er, less costly , and broadly \naccessible, today’s privately issued digital currencies operate largely outside our  existing \ninstitutional and regulatory frameworks . This raises importa nt questions for policymakers. I \nwould highlight three potential problems related in particular to central bank objectives: the role \nof the banking system, the implications fo r monetary policy, and the risks to financial stability.   \nDigital currencies and other private nonbank financial innovations challenge the notion of \nthe traditional bank business model. Our institutional frameworks have for some time regarded \ncommercial banks as foundational, even special , to our financial system  in three particular \naspects.4 First, no other type of financial company and its funding  has access to the public safety \nnet of federal deposit insurance and the Fede ral Reserve’s discount window. Second, banks a re \nregulated and supervised because of this safety net and their key role in the economy. Indeed, the \nseparation of commercial banking from investment banking and commerce was an important part of the prudential regula tory structure for many  years. Finally, only banks ha ve direct access to \nthe Federal Reserve’s payments rails.   \nNonbank financial companies are competing aggressively for these traditional banking \nfunctions. Lending platforms offered by nonbank entities allow households and bus inesses to \n                                                      \n4 Corrigan, E. Gerald, 1983. “Are Banks Special? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, 1982 Annual Report. \nAvailable at http://www.bu.edu/econ/files/2012/01/Corrigan -Are-Banks -Special_main -text.pdf .  \n\n5 \n access credit, and nonbank payment  services are growing rapidly. According to McKinsey data, \nglobal revenue in these services grew to $1.9 trillion in 2018.   \nSome federal and state banking authorities have considered the use of special purpose \ncharters as a way to cast a regulatory frame around t hese new “fintech” activities. In 2018, t he \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency announced it would issue a fintech charter , only to \nface legal challenges. At the state level, legislation is beginning to accommodate digital currency \nactivities through special purpose depository institutions operating  under new regulatory \nregimes. For example, the state of Wyoming has passed legislation that will allow these new special p urpose depository institutions  to apply  for membership in the Federal Reserve S ystem  \nand to gain access to the payment system through a Federal Reserve Bank master account.   \nThe adoption of private digital currencies at scale also has i mplications for monetary \npolicy. Should digital c urrencies lead to a large share of financial transactions taking place \noutside of the  current  system, then digital currencies may challenge current operating \nframeworks.  For instance, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy by engaging with a \nlimite d number of primary dealers. This centralized framework could be challenged should a \ndecentralized medium of exchange develop which facilitates financial settlement outside of the markets in which primary dealers operate.   \nIn addition, one of the most bas ic functions of the central bank is to supply liquidity in \ntimes of crisis.  However, without a clearly defined set of counterparties, the benefit of this \nfunction could be limited. More generally, the proliferation of digital currencies may challenge the ability of central banks to achieve their longer -run macroeconomic objectives to the extent it \nerodes the ability of monetary policy to influence broad financial conditions confronting households and businesses. \n\n6 \n Finally, the stability of the financial syste m is foundational to the ability of central banks \nto achieve their objecti ves. Events that trigger a loss of confidence or incite a classic bank -like \nrun may not find remedies in the existing regulatory and policy toolkit , including the Federal \nReserve’s d iscount window .   \n \nWhat are Central Banks Doing to Address  These Problems ?  \nThe accelerating pace of change has implications for financial systems around the world \nand for the way central banks conduct their busi ness to meet their objectives. To that end, the \nBank for International Settlements  (BIS)  has organized an Innovation Hub where global central \nbanks c an collaborate and experiment. Additionally, m ore than 50 central banks are engaged in  \ndigital currency work , according to the BIS. Countries like Swed en and Uruguay are evaluating \ndigital currency prototypes.   \nAlthough t he Federal Reserve has no plans to issue a digital currency, we are carefully \nmonitoring and studying global developments. A more immediate priority has been to modernize \nour own payment rails to meet the demand for  reliable, real -time payments , as are other central \nbanks around the world.  \nWe are currently developing a new retail payment service called F edNow  to support \nwidespread adoption of faster payments in the United States . This service will operate alongside \na private sector service to provide real -time, payment -by-payment, settlement of interbank \nobligations through debits and credits to banks’ balances in accounts at the Reserve Banks while incorporating clearing functiona lity, thus allowing for end- to-end fa ster payments . We expect \nFedNow will be able to address the concerns that we’ve heard from the public  about the need for \na real -time payments infrastructure.  \n\n7 \n Other central banks also  are addressing the desire for speed . The Reserve Bank of \nAustralia developed its Fast Settlement Service, which “enables final and irrevocable settlement \nof individual New Payments Platform transactions in real time.” TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, common ly known as TIPS, was developed t o reach retail participants  in the \nEurozone . Additionally, modernization efforts are  underway for countries with existing  faster \npayment  systems , such as the U.K.  \nAs it relates to the costs of today’s payment system, central banks are responding in \ndifferent ways. S ome countries allow central banks and other public authorities to direct ly \nregulate the payments system and often have the authority to regulate certain fees associated with making a payment . Central banks such as the Federal Reserve operat e retail payment systems to \nachieve its objectives for efficiency, access ibility,  and safety. Operating alongside the private \nsector in the delivery of retail payment services to some 10,000 financial institutions in the U.S. has been judged by the Government A ccountability Office in a 2016 report to promote \ninnovation and competition with benefit s to the public.\n5 \nCentral banks also have begun to coordinate their efforts at an international  level .  For \nexample, this year’s Financial Stability Board  (FSB)  work program highlights how the FSB, in \ncoordination with the BIS’s Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure  (CPMI) , will \ncreate a roadmap for the G -20 to enhance global cross -border payments . As participants of both \nthe FSB and the CPMI, the Federal Res erve will be working with its  international counterparts to \naddress some of the pain points  with cross -border payments. \n                                                      \n5 See: “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could \nIncrease Assurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office. August 30, 2016, at  \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO -16-614 and “The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Feder al \nReserve System. January 1998, at  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf .  \n\n8 \n Finally, a ccess to  financial services remains an important policy goal . This is an \nimportant consideration for the U.S. as well , although access to technology itself has been noted \nas a barrier with some 45  percent  of unbanked households having  neither a smartphone nor \ninternet  access at home. This means almost half of the unbanked may not be able to use these \nnew payment solutions . Providing a foundational infrastructure such as broadband internet \nservice will be essential for this population . The Federal Reserve has viewed such investments \nfavorably for purposes of the Community Reinvestment Act.   \n \nConclusion  \n Payments digitaliza tion, new entrants, and new business models will continue to disrupt \nand reshape th e financial services industry. As I noted earlier , digital currencies may well have \nthe potential to address pain points in the current payments system. At the same time, however, \nwe should be mindful of lessons from the past.   \nRealizing th e benefits  of these alternative solutions  argues for careful consideration of the \nimportant safeguards that have fostered the public’s confidence in, and the safety of , the financial \nsystem. To that end, it is important for central banks and other policymakers to monitor closely these emerging technologies and to assess potential implications to the banking industry, to financial stability, and to monetary policy, which are essential for securing  the public’s trust and \nconfidence.   \nI look forward to the insights that will come from this forum."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nJanuary 14, 2020  \nThe Central Exchange  \nKansas City, Missouri  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Thank you and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City .  I’m pleased to \ncontinue this New Year’s tradition with  the Central Exchange of offering  my view of the \neconomic outlook for the coming year.1    \nBefore I do that, however, I want to take a few minutes to remember former Federal \nReserve Chairman Paul Volcker , who passed away last month.  C ertainly, others worked more \nclosely with Chairman Volcker than I did, and a number of wonderful tributes have been offered \nsince his passing.  But in starting a new year and reflecting on the challenges facing the Federal \nReserve in 2020 and beyond, I was  thinking about how much the nation and our institution in \nparticular owes to him.  His leadership and public service also have been important to me \npersonally.  \nI came to work for the Kansas City Fed in 1982.  I was excited about my new job as a \nbank exami ner and pleased with my $10,000 annual salary to help me pay for what at that time \nwas considered an affordable 12  percent  fixed -rate mortgage.   Paul Volcker was the Fed Chair \nwho signed my examiner credentials.  In that role, I would learn that he paid cl ose attention to \nthe health of the financial system, including small banks in this region.  He understood well that \nhigh interest rates were taking their toll on the economy and especially in our region where \nagriculture, energy and real estate conditions resulted in hundreds of bank failures.  He also \nunderstood that the long- run health of the economy and the public’s well -being depended on \nbreaking the back of high inflation.  That took courage to endure short -term—but  very real — \nsuffering for long -term benefits.  \nAfter  I became president of the Kansas City Fed  in 2011, Paul Volcker took my calls and \nalways welcomed a visit to New York, willing to share his experience and advice with a new Fed \n                                                 \n1 I thank Kansas City Fed Vice President and Economist George Kahn and Senior Vice President Diane Raley for \ntheir assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n\n \n \n2 \n president like me.  He was a source of encouragement and inspir ation.  And even in New York \nCity, where they are proud of t heir “no -eye-contact -anonymity,”  when you crossed the street \nwith Paul Volcker to go to his favorite restaurant, heads turned.   \nHe spoke his mind and his views were well informed.  Watch his blunt statements at \ncongressional hearings and other public events.  Intellectual honesty, public service, and \nleadership were his hallmarks.  And even if you didn’t agree with him, you knew where he stood \nand that his interest was in how best to serve the Ame rican public.   \nFinally, the Kansas City Fed owes a debt of gratitude to Paul Volcker whose attendance \nwas essential to the 1982 launch of our fledging economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole, \nWyoming.  In the years that followed, he remained accessible to us.  In 2009, Paul came to \nKansas City, where he was awarded the Truman Medal for Economic Policy . He was willing to \nread our Bank’s proposals and papers and would offer his comments – sometimes criticism, \nsometimes support – but it was always helpful a nd welcomed insight.   \nCertainly, I did not agree with him on every issue, but that is never the point.  Leadership, \nintegrity, and service were at the core of his character , and it’s something to aspire to today .  It \nwas an honor to have started my career  under his leadership as Fed chair and to have engaged \nwith him during his post -Fed years.  I am grateful for his mentorship. \nOf course, the economic environment that we face today is quite different than the one \nthat challenged Paul Volcker and his collea gues on the Federal Open Market Committee.  That is \nperhaps a good segue to sharing my views on the challenges the Federal Reserve faces in 2020 as \nwe consider the economic landscape and our monetary policy settings.  \nWhen I spoke to you last January, the e conomy looked to be in good shape in terms of \ngrowth with low unemployment and low inflation.   At that time, the Federal Reserve had raised \n\n \n \n3 \n its policy interest rate to a range of 2¼ to 2½ percent —a total of 225 basis points since the end of  \n2015.  The len gthy expansion seemed poised to continue with historically low unemployment \nand muted inflation, although sentiment began to sour and recession fears mounted in the face of \nslowing  global growth and trade policy uncertainty .  Given these downside risks , the Federal \nReserve reversed course last July and eased policy three times .   \n \nOutlook for 2020 \nAs we turn the page to a new year, many of the themes from 2019 seem likely to carry \nover to 2020.  In particular, I continue to see the expansion supported by solid growth in consumer spending with continued weakness in manufacturing and  business spending.  While a  \nstrong labor market and rising incomes will support consumer spending, the underlying cause of weak business spending—sluggish global growth and ongoing trade tensions —will likely persist \nover the near term .  The combination of these factors should lead to slower growth in real \nGDP —our broadest indicator of economic activity —to its longer -run trend of 1¾ to 2 percent.  \nWith growth near trend, I would e xpect the unemployment rate to remain near i ts current level of \n3.5 percent and inflation to remain benign.   \n  Because the consumer is critical to th e ongoing expansion, monitoring a number of \nfundamental factors that drive consumer spending will be impor tant this year .  The good news is \nthat the consumer is entering the new year with considerable spending momentum.  For example, household consumption data was stronger than expected in the third quarter with  spending on \ndurable and non -durable goods r ising at a solid pace.  While we don’t yet have official data on \n\n \n \n4 \n consumer spending for December, a report from MasterCard  indicates a strong holiday shopping \nseason with record high e -commerce sales.2  \nOne reason to be optimistic that this momentum is sustainable is that residential \ninvestment appears to have responded to lower mortgage rates. Recent data indicate positive \ncontributions from most major housing indicators , as single -family construction and brokers’ \ncommissions rebound.  Forward -looking m easures, such as single -family starts and permits, \ncontinue to move up strongly, suggesting the strength in residential investment growth will likely contribute to growth in the medium term.  Another key factor to keep an eye on is the labor market.  With the unemployment rate at \n3.5 percent, a robust labor market supported consumer spending in 2019 and should continue to \ndo so in 2020, e ven as payroll growth continues to slow  in line with the economy’s potential .  \nThe economy added on average 176,000 jobs per month through December of last year , \ncompared to 223,000 per month in 2018.  In addition, the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  has reported \nthat the pace of job openings has slowed.\n3   \nWhile I project  consumer spending to remain robust , some  moderation from recent strong \ngrowth is to be expected for a number of reasons.  First, as I just discussed, employment is likely \nto grow at a slower pace this year than last year.  Second , while the consumption of goods has \nremained robust, the consumpti on of services , which represent s a larger share of consumer \nspending, decelerated in the third quarter .  Third , real retail sales data have leveled off since \nreaching a peak in August of last year , and imports of consumer goods and autos have slowed. \n                                                 \n2 https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press -releases/mastercard -spendingpulse -u-s-retail -sales -\ngrew -3-4-percent -this-holiday -season/  \n3 According to t he Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey ( JOLTS) , job openings \ndeclined  from 5.2% of total private nonfarm payroll employment plus job openings at the end of November 2018 \n(the current cyclical high) to 4.8% of total private employment plus job openings at the end of October 2019.  \n\n \n \n5 \n The recent slowing in imports may reflect the effect of tariff increases that were imposed in \nSeptember and have fallen mostly on consumer goods.  Finally, consumer spending could \nmoderate based on sentiment about the economic outlook.  W hile confidence measures remain \nnear post -recession highs, expectations for the future bear watching.  Based on the Conference \nBoard ’s survey  of consumer confidence, the differential between consumer expectations for the \nfuture and their assessment of current conditions has  widened over the past several years. In the \npast, when confidence in future conditions has fallen relative to confidence in the present \nsituation, consumer spending has tended to slow.  That will be something to keep on an eye on this year .  \nIn contrast t o consumer spending, business spending has been relatively weak for some \ntime.  T he goods -producing sector, in particular, which includes manufacturing, mining, energy \nproduction and construction, has  faced a range of challenges that has limited the  pace o f its \nexpansion. For example, U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports abroad, along \nwith weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy , have created stiff \nheadwinds for manufacturers. Our manufacturing survey f or the Kansas City Fed’s region  shows \nthat activity has contracted in each of the past six months .  In addition, the Institute for Supply \nManagement’s manufacturing survey indicates that national manufacturing activity moved into contractionary territory i n August. For the energy sector, oil prices declined 24 percent from \nOctober 2018 to October 2019, contributing to a slowing in drilling activity across most oil -\nproducing regions.  More recently, oil prices have rebounded somewhat , which may lead to some \nincrease in production going forward.  \nSo on balance , the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of employment and \nlow inflation, while downside risks have lingered  and strained key parts of the goods -producing \n\n \n \n6 \n sector. This dichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as we determine the appropriate \nstance for monetary policy under such conditions.  \n \nChallenges for Monetary Policy  \nLooking back at last year , I viewed monetary policy decisions in light of an  econ omy that \nwas slowing , as expected , toward its trend rate of growth due in large part to the ebbing of fiscal \nstimulus  and the shift to higher interest rates .  But I also recognized that  slower global growth \nabroad  and trade policy uncertainty posed downsid e risks to the outlook.  Even so, I did not \nsupport the three outright cuts in the  target federal funds rate starting in July  because I preferred \nto wait for clearer evidence that the headwinds from global developments were threatening to \nderail the ongoin g economic expansion.  I supported the decision in December to hold rates  \nsteady as a prudent move while  we assess a number of factors going into this  year.   \nWith an economy growing at or above potential, a strong labor market, and low and \nstable inflatio n, policymakers  will need time to judge the proper stance of policy .  We will need \nto assess whether the 2019 rate cuts prove to be “ insurance cuts ” that will need to be reversed if \nheadwinds fade .  On the other hand, the 2019 rate cuts may turn out to be a reset to  a more \nneutral policy stance , recognizing  that the equilibrium federal  funds rate may be lower than \npreviously assumed.  Finally, it could be the case that  downside risks and uncertainties persist in \na way that keeps investment spending weak and spills over to the consumer, altering the  modal \noutlook and requiring further policy easing . \n  Over the longer run, a key concern is the capacity of monetary policy to address a future \neconomic downturn should it arise.  One reason for this concern is tha t the federal funds rate is \nhistorically low, leaving little policy space to deal with a future recession .  In a typical recession, \n\n \n \n7 \n the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has reduced the federal funds rate target by 5 to 6 \npercentage points.  With the funds rate target currently at 1½ to 1¾ percent, the Fed has less than \nhalf the policy space available relative to the past  before hitting the zero lower bound on rates.  \nThis is not just a concern for U.S. policymakers.  Interest rates are at historically lo w \nlevels in a number of advanced economies, including the euro area, Japan, Canada, and the UK.  In fact, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as a number of other central \nbanks , have set their policy rates below zero.    \nCentral banks a lso have expressed concern that inflation has run persistently below their \ntarget s.  In the United States , both headline and core inflation as measured by the personal \nconsumption expenditure price index have remained muted since the Fed announced its 2 perc ent \ninflation objective in 2012.  The fact that this, too, is a global issue affecting both Japan and the \neuro area, r aises the possibility that global structural factors outside the control of policymakers \nare driving inflation dynamics.   \nIn the Unit ed States, persistently low inflation has been unusual  in light of historically \ntight labor markets.  This has led policymakers to mark down their estimates of the natural rate of unemployment —the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation.  These e stimates of \nthe natural rate have come down from over 5 percent in 2013 to a median of 4.1 percent in \nDecember 2019.\n4  Even with this lowering of estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, the \nactual unemployment rate still remains below the natural r ate.  In the past , this situation would \nhave typically put upward pressure on inflation.  So it raises questions about the accuracy of \nestimates of the natural rate as well as about the relationship between inflation and slack in labor markets.    \n                                                 \n4 Based on the central tendency of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for the longer -run \nunemployment rate reported in 2013 and the median  projection  of the SEP reported in December 2019.  \n\n \n \n8 \n This weak ening of the relationship between inflation and labor market slack perplexes \ncentral banks, making it very difficult to credibly achieve their inflation targets  by pushing the \nunemployment rate down.  Even if such a policy were successful it might entail a  further, \nsignificant tightening  of the labor market , leading to a misallocation of labor resources and a \nbuildup of financial imbalances.   \nGiven these concerns, the Federal Reserve i s engaging in a r eview of its monetary policy \nstrategy, tools, and communications. The review has several parts, including a series of Fed \nListens events around the country designed to help policymakers better understand the \nperspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and with varied interests.  The Kansas City Fed \nhosted one  such event in October.  T he Federal Open Market Committee also is devot ing time at \na series of its  regular meetings to assess lessons learned in the aftermath of the Great Recession  \nand to consider  how monetary policy can best serve the public, including possible enhancements \nor changes to its monetary policy  framework that would help the Federal Reserve meet its \nstatutory objectives for employment and price stability —especially in the event of a fut ure \ndownturn in economic activity .  Fed  Chair Jay Powell has indicated that the FOMC will publicly \nreport the conclusions of its discussions, likely during  the first half of this year.   \n \nConclusion \n The U.S. economy is currently doing well, with real GDP growth near trend, \nunemployment near record lows, and inflation low and stable .  While business spending is in a \nsoft spot, household spending has remained robust. Keeping rates on hold for now is appropriate in my view as we assess the economy’s response to last year’s rate cuts and monitor incoming data.   \n\n \n \n9 \n  For the longer run, the Federal Reserve will  be reevaluat ing its monetary policy \nstrategies, tools, and communications to address future downturns in a low interest rate economy.  \nWith limited policy s pace between our current federal funds rate target and the zero lower bound \non nominal interest rates, policymakers are likely to find themselves looking  deep into the policy  \ntoolkit to fight future recessionary shocks .  Clearly explaining the Federal Reserve’s monetary \npolicy strategies and longer -run goals will be essential to the institution’s credibility and to the \npublic ’s trust and confidence."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 18, 2019  \nEnergy and the Economy: Markets in Transition  \nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \nDenver, Colorado  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n2 \n I’m pleased to welcome you to the fourth  annual energy conference  hosted by the Federal \nReserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas . Energy is a key sector of  our regional economies . \nTaken together, our two regions account for more than 50 percent of U.S. oil prod uction and an \neven larger share of the headquarters of U.S. exploration and production companies, including \nseveral right here in Denver .  \nThe title and theme of this year’s conference  is “Energy and the Economy: Markets in \nTransition .”  As the title sugge sts, there are several notable transitions that we will consider and \ndiscuss today.  \nWe will look first at the transitions underway as global oil markets calibrate the dynamics \nof rising U.S. production amid signs of slowing global economic growth . The Kan sas City Fed’s \nthird quarter energy survey released last Friday showed that new drilling in our region has \nslowed further and firms anticipate more deterioration in coming months, so we are keeping a \nparticularly watchful eye on the sector at the moment.  \nWe will  also discuss the energy transition occurring in the U.S. power utility sector \ndriven by abundant, inexpensive natural gas and rapid growth in renewable energy generation . \nWithin the Kansas City Federal Reserve District  alone , renewables’ share of e lectric power \ngeneration capacity has grown from less than 10 percent a decade ago to more than 25 percent in \n2019 . At the same time, our region produces more coal  — the primary fuel being replaced in \npower generation  — than any other Federal Reserve District . So understanding more about how \nthis transition is evolving is vital for understanding economic trends across our region.  \nFinally, w e will explore transitions in energy finance, with an eye toward the factors that \nare influencing investment and r isk management within the oil and gas , and the renewable \nenergy industries . Understand ing how transitions in the broader energy sector could affect \n\n3 \n financial institutions both la rge and small across our region  is an important aspect of the Federal \nReserve’ s role as a bank supervisor and regulator.  \nTo help guide us through each of these topics, we have a distinguished set of speakers \nand panelists with considerable expertise and  experience from both the private and public \nsectors . I look forward to their co mments and your participation in discussing these themes.  \n As energy market s experience  transitions , they do so in the context of changing dynamics \nin the broader economy . My remarks today will highlight the challenges that monetary \npolicymakers fac e in reading and understanding these transitions while determin ing the \nappropriate setting for policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price \nstability.  \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not \nintended to represent  the view s of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nTHE U.S. ECONOMIC OU TLOOK  \nLooking across most of our economic measures, the U.S. economy is generally \nperforming well . We are now in the  11th year of the current expansion, and the economy has , by \nmost accounts, achieved full employment and stable prices.  The unemployment rate is currently  \n3.5 percent, which is  the lowest level on record in the past 50 years . And inflation, which \nhistorically h as moved higher as the labor market strengthens, has remained low and stable.  \nWith respect to the overall growth rate of the economy, 2019 has been a transition year . \nAs expected , the pace of economic growth has decelerate d to a level more consistent with the \nlonger -run trend growth rate of the economy following two years of strong growth in 2017 and \n2018 . This transition was expected in part due to the tightness of the labor market . When an \neconomy  approach es its full-employment level, the lack of available workers, particularly skilled \n\n4 \n workers, naturally limits the pace at which business activity can expand . The latest reading from \nthe National Federation of Independent Business es survey confirms this dynamic. The percent of \nsurvey respondents that cited  finding qualified workers as their No. 1  problem hit a 46 -year \nrecord high in July .  \nThe transition from faster growth last year to a more moderate pace in 2019 also is \nrelated to fiscal policy . The economy received a boost to aggregate demand from stimulus in \n2018 in the form of a tax cut to businesses and households in addition to increased government \nspending . This stimulus produce d a transitory boost to growth that was expected to eventually  \nfade in 2019 and 2020.  \nUnder these conditions , we have seen the pace of growth decelerate from a strong annual \nrate near 3 percent toward a pace of growth closer to 2 percent . Looking forward, I expect \ngrowth to slow  a bit further over the medium term as it approaches the economy’ s longer -run \ngrowth rate, which I view  as just under 2 percent.  \nWhile the aggregate economic growth picture has unfolded largely as expected in 2019, \nthere are important developments in play across broad sectors of the economy . A clear \ndichotomy is emerging between the services sector1, which is supported by strong  consumption \ngrowth, and the goods -producing sector, which is facing a range of economic crosscurrents . \nAcross both of these sectors, t he primary driver for economic growth in the U.S. is t he consumer . \nThe strong labor market with high levels of employment and upward pressure on wages has \nprovided the fuel to support solid consumption growth  and contribute to a high  level of consumer \nconfidence . Strong consumer momentum, which is also suppor ted by an overall personal savings \n                                                 \n1 Service -providing industries tied closely to the consumer include education and health services, leisure \nand hospitality, information, finance, and wholesale and retail trade.  \n \n\n5 \n rate that remains at a stable and relatively high level, has been the key underpinning of my \noutlook for continued economic expansion over the medium term.  \nThe goods -producing sector, which includes manufacturing, mining,  energy production \nand construction, has, on the other hand,  faced a range of challenges that has limited its pace of \nexpansion . For example, an expansion of U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports \nabroad, along with weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy \nhave  created stiff headwind s for manufacturers . Our manufacturing survey for the region shows \nthat activity has contracted in  each of the past three months , and the national ISM survey  \nindicates that manufacturing activity for the nation also moved into contractionary territory in \nAugust . For the energy sector, oil prices are down about 20 percent from a year ago, contributing \nto a slowing in drilling activity across most oil -producing regions in the country.   And in the \nhousing sector, although  forward -looking indicators have improved recently , rising mortgage \nrates in 2018 and the first half of 2019 coupled with rising housing prices contributed to a \ndecline in home sales and six conse cutive quarters of declining residential investment .  \n So on balance, while the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of \nemployment and low inflation, downside risks are prominent and have strained key parts of the \ngoods -producing sector . This d ichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as they determine \nthe appropriate stance for monetary policy  under such conditions . \n \nDATA DEPENDENCE VERS US RISK MANAGEMENT  \nAs policymakers confront this challenge, policy choices can become more difficult . \nEasing policy may be viewed as a proactive step to ward off weakness in a particular sector in \nthe attempt to prevent th at weakness from spreading to broader parts of the economy . Another \n\n6 \n approach would be to closely monitor the sectoral weakness, but wait until signs emerge of a \nbroader slowdown in activity before taking action . To better illustrate this challenge , I’ll talk \nabout these  different approaches to policy setting  using two frequently cited descriptions : a data-\ndependen t approach  and a risk-manag ement  approach . I’ll argue that both elements are important \nto monetary policy decisions.  \nFederal Reserve policymakers began using the phrase “data dependent” in 2012 to \ndescribe their approach to policy making . The phrase was intended to convey that polic ymakers \ncould not credibly commit to specific actions at specific dates in the future, but instead, their \nview of the appropriate setting of interest rates would evolve based on new data received . Such \nan approach could be misread as suggesting a “data -dependent” policymaker is solely influenced \nby the most recent data release , basing his or her decision on the arrival of new data  rather than a \nmodal outlook for the economy .  \n“Data-dependent” policy decisions in my view actually encompass a much broader  and \nmulti -faceted  process in which the da ta represent just one element . The foundation for the  \ndecision -making process is  a collection of information  that includes not only incoming data, but \nalso the perspectives from my District contacts . Their anecdote s provide timely information that \nis not likely to  appear in the data for several weeks or months given the inherent delays in \nreporting and revision of data statistics .  \nWith  this information in hand, judg ments are required to determine how t his broad \ninformation updates the  economic outlook for the near and medium term . Given the long and \nvariable lags in the time it takes for monetary policy decisions to transmit to the broader \neconomy, one’s outlook  for key variables such as real GDP growth, the unempl oyment rate, and \ninflation are central to determin ing the appropriate policy action for today . So when I refer to a \n\n7 \n “data -dependent” approach for policymaking, it is this broader approach  that I have in mind  \nrather than a short -term reaction to the most re cent data point . \nA second commonly cited approach to policymaking is “risk management .”  This \napproach is not  necessarily distinct from a “data -dependent” approach . Rather than focusing on \none’s view of the data and the mostly likely, or moda l, view for the outlook, a risk -management \napproach seeks to assess the range of risks  and then determine the policy action that best  \npositions the economy to weather those risks.  \nIn the current context, while one’s modal outlook for the economy may be consistent \nwith the FOMC’s dual mandate, downside risks may represent alternative scenarios with \nundesirable outcomes for econom ic growth and stability . One such current risk is associate d with \nthe ongoing trade policy uncertainty . Key questions relevant for policymaker s as they assess this \nrisk would include: How have developments in trade policy impacted the economy since the start \nof 2018 ? How will trade policy decisions going forward influence the outlook? What role is \ntrade policy uncertainty having on the decisions  of businesses and cons umers? Is monetary \npolicy an effective tool to mitigate risks that may emanate from trade policy uncertainty?  \nAssessment of the range of risks facing the economy, which expand far beyond trade \npolicy uncertainty, along with judg ments  of the possible economic implications should any of \nthose risks transpire, may justify policy action as insurance . In such a circumstance, it may be the \ncase that the overall  economy is growing at an above -trend rate and the modal outlook is in line \nwith our dual mandate objectives . But the emergenc e of downside risks  could be viewed as \nsufficiently threatening to warrant an adjustment in policy while those risks persist.  \nA recent example of  this type of situation occurred  in 2014 and 2015 when the economy  \nfaced several shocks that impacted a few industries at a time while  the overall economy was \n\n8 \n expanding at a solid pace . During this period, the price of oil fell by more than  50 percent, the \ndollar appreciated by  approximately 20  percent, and agricultural commodity prices such as corn \nand soybeans fell by more than  25 percent . These shifts in prices contributed to a downturn in the \nenergy, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors  and represented downside risks for the broader \necono my. \nIn this instance , the FOMC did not choose  to directly provide additional accommodation \nto the economy, but instead communicated a shift in its view of the appropriate path for policy \ngoing forward . Using the median of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Pro jections (SEP) as a \nreference point, the projection for the appropriate setting of policy at the end of 2016 was \nlowered by nearly a full percentage point from the March 2014 projection to the December 2015 \nprojection . This adjustment provided appropriate support for the broader economy at a time \nwhen some sectors were experiencing weaknes s. And as the impact of those shocks dissipated \nover time, the FOMC  then implemented the projected policy adjustments that had been delayed . \nDuring this period, the broade r economy continued to expand with real GDP growth remaining \nabove trend and average emp loyment growth in excess of 200,000 new jobs per month.  \nOne c hallenge with this type of risk -management approach to policy setting is that while \nthe benefits of taking out insurance may be clear, the costs are not. One potential cost is that such \nan insurance policy risks overheating the sectors of the economy that are already performing \nwell. This can lead to a misallocation of resources toward those  interest rate -sensi tive sectors at \nthe expense of sectors that may be better positioned for  growth over the longer  run. A second \npotential cost stems from the fact that an easing in monetary polic y is designed to encourage \nrisk-taking and leverage . In the earlier periods of an economic expansion, risks associated with \nincreasing leverage may be moderate, and as such the cost of extra insurance may be low . But \n\n9 \n these costs move higher as the economic expansion matures and as levels of corporate debt and \nother vulnerabilities be come elevated.  \n \nMONETARY POLICY  \nTurning to the current monetary policy settings , data dependence and risk management \ncontinue to provide important strategy foundations for policymakers . In 2018, as the economic \nexpansion continued and the unemployment rate  moved b elow most estimates of its long -run \nlevel, the FOMC continued to gradually remove accommodation and the federal funds rate \nmoved cl oser to estimates of its longer -run level . At the start of 2019 with an outlook for \neconomic growth to decelerate tow ard its longer -run trend growth rate, downside risks had \nemerged and the Committee announced that it would be patient as it determined what future \nadjustments would be appropriate . Then at its July and September meetings, the Committee \ntwice lowered the fe deral funds rates, citing implications of global developments for the \neconomic  outlook as well as muted inflation pressures .  \nI dissented from the recent de cisions to ease policy based on my view of the outlook as it \nrelates to the Committee’s objectives f or price stability and maximum employment . From a data -\ndependence perspective, the moderation of economic growth in 2019 has been for the most part \nin line with my outlook , in which I expect growth  to gradually decline toward it s longer -run \ntrend level over the medium term . The combination of record -low unemployment, moderate \ngrowth, and low and stable inflation with an unchanged outlook led me to conclude that an \nunchanged setting for the federal funds target range  remained appropriate.  \nSupporting  an un changed policy rate in recent meetings does not ignore the downside \nrisks facing our economy . The emergence of those key risks to the outlook as early as the fourth \n\n10 \n quarter of 2018 caused me to moderate my expectation that further rate increases were neede d. \nSimilar to the experience from the 2014 -15 period that I described earlier, I shifted downward \nmy view of the appropriate path for policy over the next one to two  years  in light of the \ndownside risks that have emerged over the past year and the implicat ions of those risks for \ncertain sectors  of the economy . I view this as an appropriate adjustment that is consistent with \nboth data -dependent and risk -management strategies.  \nWhile some may view the cost of a reduction in rates as benign given that inflation  \nremains some what below our 2 percent longer -run target, I am mindful that rate reductions are \nintended to boost demand and encourage risk -taking and leverage . The ability of the Federal \nReserve to offset any unintended effects related to financial stabili ty at this stage of the business \ncycle seem s limited . In the most recent Financial Stability Report issued by the Federal Reserve \nBoard in May, assessments for overall vulnerabilities were mostly sanguine . But the report also \nnoted that “elevated business debt, easy lending standards, and strong risk appetite pose a \nvulnerability… that potentially increases the downside risk to broader economic activity.”  As \ncorporate debt continues to rise to high levels with the fastest growth among the riskiest firms, \nthe largest banks also are lowering their loss-absorbing capital levels . I view this combination of \nrisks as potentially costly to employment and growth, especially at this stage of the expansion .  \nLooking forward, I will remain attentive to the incoming data for signs that downside \nrisks to the outlook materialize in a way that meaningfully affects broad economic conditions . \nUnder those circumstances, I would be prepared to adjust monetary policy accordingly.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n\n11 \n Consumers continue to drive  momentum for economic expansion  in the face of downside \nrisks that over the past year  have slowed activity in several key  sectors . In these circumstances, \nboth data -dependent and risk -management strategies  guide policymakers as they consider \nmonetary poli cy settings . My own outlook for the economy does not call for a mo netary policy \nresponse. While weakness in manufacturing and business investment  is evident , it is not clear \nthat monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by business es in those sectors  \nwhen weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action . Should downside \nrisks spill over into the broader economy in a way that fundamentally affects the consumer and \nshifts the overall outlook, a monetary policy  response may be required ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 15, 2019  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago Payments Symposium  \nChicago, Ill.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n1 \n I appreciate the o pportunity to join you today  and want to thank Ellen Bromagen  and the \nChicago Fed team for organizing this important conference . I look forward to the insights that \nwill come from this year’s program and its participants.   \nToday’s theme of innovation recognizes that the changing payments landscape is both \nimportant and exciting, as well as unsettling and disruptive . While a  real-time payment \ninfrastructure for retail payments is the nation’s most significant modernization in more than 40 \nyears , other innovations such as digital currencies enabled by technological adv ancements \ncontinue to emerge . Determining what role they might play in safely and effectively serving the \nbroader payments needs of U.S . households and businesses will require careful public policy \nresearch and analysis .  \nIn the case of faster payments, t he Federal Reserve’s recent decision to build and operate \na real -time payment system also followed years of research and analysis, including broad public \nengagement . Beyond their popularity for speed and convenience, faster payments demonstrate \nvalue in yield ing real economic benefits . In particular, individuals and businesses could realize \nmore flexibility to manage their money and to make time -sensitive payments whenever needed . \nThese advantages could result in better cash flow management and efficienci es for small \nbusinesses , and enable some individuals to avoid high -cost borrowing and penalties such as \noverdraft or late fees .  \nGiven these potential economic benefits, the Federal Reserve determined that upgrades to \nthe payments capabilities of both the Federal Reserve and the private sector were important . To \nfacilitate private -sector advancements, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  approved in \n2017 access to accounts that would allow settlement between and among banks participating in \nprivate -sector payment systems . At the same time, the Fed eral Reserve  began to assess the F aster \n\n2 \n Payments Task Force’s recommendation, asking it to evaluate what role the Reserve Banks \nmight  play in providing real -time settlement services . This year, the Board announced its \ndecision to operate a real -time payment service alongside the private sector . It also announced \nthat further efforts to support private sector services through exploring expansion of hours for the \nFedwire Funds Service and the National Settle ment Service would follow .  \nRecognizing that time to market is important, the Federal Reserve has committed to \nlaunching this new service, known as FedNow, as soon as possible. Work is underway now to \nengage with industry participants on the initial design  and features of the service .   \nAs financial institutions prepare to connect to this critical infrastructure, some are raising \nquestions about the strategic choices they face . I’d like to address three such questions in my \nremarks today . First, will the pr ivate and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems \nwork togethe r seamlessly and ubiquitously? Second, will the pricing scheme be the same for all \nbanks regardless of their size? Third, how soon will the FedNow Service be operational? Before \naddressing each of those questions, I first want to briefly discuss the Fed eral Reserve ’s history as \na payments provider as context .  \n \nFROM THE BEGINNING  \nAlthough real -time payments represent s a significant evolution in our payments system, it \nis not the first time our payments system has been through a significant transition . History shows \nthat the central bank has worked effectively with the private sector and that the nature of this \npartnership has benefitted the system, its participants and the public.  \nThe Panic of 1907 was a catalyst in the creation of the Federal Reserve . One of the \nhallmarks of th e 1907 financial crisis was a nationwide currency shortage that left businesses \n\n3 \n unable to pay workers and settle accounts . Absent a central bank, a few larg e private institutions \nheld tremendous influence  over the financial system . When these institutions  were either \nunwilling or unable to provide necessary liquidity, local bankers w ould band together and issue \nspecial certificates that effectively functioned  as a privately -issued currency . Creating a central \nbank was intended in part to address what had been referred to as a “famine of currency,” during \nthis crisis . This new central bank, according to Ca rter Glass, one of its congressional founders , \nneeded to  “tear down these tollgates u pon the highways of commerce.”  \nEarly on , the Fed developed a  nationwide par clearance system for checks that ensured \nthat a recipient of a payment received the full value regardless of location . In the 1950s, when \nrising check  volumes and a lack of standardization even in the physical dimensions of checks  \nwere proving problematic to banks, the Fed and the American Bankers Association in \npartnership developed the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) system.  \nIn the 1970s, the Fed and private sector developed the automated clearinghouse network \n(ACH) to improve efficiency in the handling of many routine and recurring payments, thus \neliminating the need and cost associated with processing paper checks in these instances.  \nDuring the 1990s, the Fed recognized that the internet’s growing role in our economy \nwould prompt a similar evolution in payments, which then were still largely made by check . A \nnational commission headed by Alice Rivlin, vice c hair of the Fed’s Board of Gover nors at the \ntime, explored the future of the Fed’s role in retail payment services . Through a public feedback \nprocess, the commission reached two conclusions . First, the Federal Reserve Banks should \ncontinue to serve as an operator for retail payments . Second, the Fed should work collaboratively \n\n4 \n with the banking industry to improve efficiency and develop strategies for the movement toward \na digital payments environment.1 \nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when some banks sought to limit customer \nwithdrawal s, the Fed assured the public it was open and ready to meet liquidity needs while \nfinding alternative ground transportation  for check transfers . Importantly, the Fed pledged to \nimmediately credit to banks all checks it processed . This promise to honor “flo at” provided a key \nsource of liquidity.  \nIn the months after the 9/11 attacks, the Fed played a key role in promoting greater use of \nelectronic check processing  to eliminate  significant inefficiencies in the payments system . \nCongress ultimately passed legislation, known as Check 21, to support the nationwide \nachievement of this improvement to our payment system .   \nThis historical record shows that having the Federal Reserve as an operator within the \npayments system has yielded public benefits . This reco rd also suggests that participation in real -\ntime settlement services will raise performance and accountability for the FedNow Service and \nothers.  \n \nTHE ROAD TO FEDNOW  \nFrom the Rivlin Commission to the efficiencies gained through Check 21, the Fed eral \nReserve , working with the industry , had already taken the first steps on the road that would lead \nto today’s faster payments supported by real -time settlement infrastructure . Over the past six \nyears , there ha ve been a number of collaborative initiatives between the Federal Reserve and \nindustry stakeholders on strategies for improving the payment system .  \n                                                           \n1 “The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Federal Reserve System. January \n1998. https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf  \n\n5 \n Among these, in  2015, the Federal Reserve convened the Faster Payments Task Force, a \n320-member group comprised of a broad range of industry participants . Its conclusions – that the \nFederal Reserve  should develop a 24x7x365 settlement ser vice to support faster payments  and \nexplore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operati onal role(s) in faster payments – \naligned with both the outcomes of the Rivlin Commission and the Fed’s longstanding role in \npayments . The United States Treasury shared that view, recommending last year that “the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the \ndevelopment of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and \nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”2 \nThroughout its history, access to Fed payment services, such as check, ACH, and funds \ntransfer services, has facilitated the banking system’s ability to deliver its services with \nnationwide reach . In addition, these services have traditionally operated alongside private -sector \nservices , achieving broad public benefits . Giving the industry choices in payments services, t his \ncompe tition has spurred lower costs, increased efficiencies and better service for users, as noted \nby independent reviews including the Government Accountability Office in 2016 .3 \n \nQUESTIONS  \nWith this historic al context , I’ll turn to each of the three questions I noted earlier : 1) will \nthe private and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems work together seamlessly \n                                                           \n2 U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System That Creates Econo mic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and  \nInnovation,” (July 2018) at 156.

In a market structure with \nmultiple operators of real -time gross settlement services for faster payments,  the ability to secure \nnationwide access is advanced when customers of a bank participating in one service are able to \nreach the customers of a bank participating in another service . Similar to the efficiencies gained \nthrough the development of a consistent MICR system with checks in the 1950s, and the \nnationwide reach achieved with existing payment services, common standards and rules for \nseamless processing of real-time payment messages  is a desirable feature . But it is one the \nFederal Reserve recognizes may be difficult to achieve, at least early on .  \nAcross the existing payments landscape, services with multiple operators have been able \nto achieve the goal of nationwide reach . Although the approaches differ, they have functioned  \neffectively.  \nOne approach allows the direct exchange of payments between operators, where \npayments originated by a participant of one service could be received by a participant of another \nservice . This situation exists today in the case of the ACH system . The direct exchange of \nmessages between operators would require technical functionality to move the messages and a \nmethod to enable settlement across systems and participants . The level of cooperation between \noperators and complexity increases significan tly with this approach . I don’t consider it an \ninsurmountable challenge, but it could take time to achieve , and thus, it may not be an initial \nelement of the FedNow Service.  \n\n7 \n Another approach to achieving nationwide reach is for financial institutions to participate \nin multiple services that are not interoperable, but where at least one service has achieved \nnationwide reach on its own . Such an approach is used today in the funds transfer system . A \nfinancial institution that participates in multiple services can choose which service to use for \ntransactions, depending on any number of factors, such as fees, functionality, and counterparties \na particular service can reach.  \nAs we engage with the industry, we are exploring these approaches and other potential \npaths to achieving the ultimate goal of nationwide reach for faster payments . We also recognize \nthat the initial approach may change over time as technology, industry practices, and the \nrelationship between real-time gross settlement  services for faster payments evolve . To be sure, \nthe Federal Reserve is committed to exploring with the industry interoperability and other paths \nto achieving ubiquity.  \nA second question that has surfaced relates to how the FedNow service will be priced . As \nnoted in the Federal Register Notice, the Board of Governors will announce the FedNow fee \nstructure and fee schedule before the service is launched . This transparency in pricing will take \ninto account prevailing market practices and can be expected to i nclude a combination of per -\nitem fees, charged to sending and potentially to receiving banks, and fixed participation fees .  \nAs with existing services, the FedNow Service will be subject to the Monetary Control \nAct which requires that aggregate revenues ma tch costs over the long run and requires the Board \nof Governors to adopt pricing principles specifically to avoid unfair competition with the private \nsector . The Federal Reserve follows a transparent process in describing its schedule of fees for \neach serv ice line in an annual notice to the public.  \n \n\n8 \n Because the current private sector service initially  proposed flat -fee pricing , questions \nhave been raised about whether th e Fed will offer the same pricing or a volume -based pricing \nstructure. Implic it in this qu estion is whether one approach is fairer than the other . \nPricing based on volume or bulk is common in many industries . In the context of \npayment services, there are  often large fixed costs . When a service has more volume, it is able to \noffer the service at a lower pric e because the costs are spread out over more transactions . Unlike \nservices provided to a small group of participants with high transaction volumes, Federal \nReserve services are provided to a diverse group of participants that vary in terms of size and \ntransaction volume.  \nIn such circumstances , volume -based pricing helps ensure sufficient use of the service to \nspread costs over greater volumes, yielding lower prices for all participants . Because of these \nbenefits , volume -based pricing has been considered an acceptable pricing strategy, as noted  in \nthe 2016 GAO review . That said , a pricing structure for the FedNow Service has not yet been \ndetermined.  \nFinally, w e have received a number of questions about th e timing and a desire to see the \nnew service delivered quickly . Recognizing that time to market is an important consideration for \nmany industry participants , the Federal Reserve has committed to launching the new FedNow \nService as soon as we can . Efforts are now underway to gather input from industry participants \non the initial design and features of the service . As these  details are finalized, the Board of \nGovernors  will publish a final service description .  \nWhile the initial availability of the FedNow Service is a top priority for the Federal \nReserve , the achievement of true nationwide reach  remains a critical measure of success for \nfaster payments  for any service, including the FedNow Service or a private -sector service . \n\n9 \n Connecting more than 10,000 financial institutions to a faster payment service w ill take some \ntime. For example, by the middle of 2019, banks that had joined the private -sector service \nrepresented less than 1 percent of all U.S. banking institutions .  \nIn addition to moving quickly to deliver the service, we will ensure that industry \nparticipants are prepared to connect to the FedNow Service . Ahead of the service’s availability, \nthe Federal Reserve will be work ing closely with banks and their technology partners to prepare \nfor expeditious onboarding.  \nBeyond the questions related to inte roperability, pricing and time to market, the safety of \nthe payment system is crucial to the nation’s economic growth and financial stability . The \nFederal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the safety of the U.S. \npayment system by providing liquidity and operation al continuity in times of crisis . As \nprominence of faster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow \nService will allow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support t he \nbanking  system and the broader economy .  \nAs operator of the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve also will be in a position to \npromote the development and implementation of industry -wide standards, as has been the case in \nother payments systems where the  Fed plays an operational role . Given the irrevocable, real -time \nnature of faster payments, the ability to detect and prevent fraud will be a key aspect of ensuring \nsafety of the system.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nInnovation brings important benefits to our economy . We are seeing faster payments \nservices grow in popularity . An efficient payment system facilitates and encourages economic \n\n10 \n activity by making it faster, cheaper, and more convenient for individuals and businesses to pay \nfor goods and services . Creating real -time settlement services in the U.S. lays a foundation on \nwhich both banks across the country and the broader payment industry can build modern, \ninnovative, and safe faster payment services.  \nThe Federal Reserve has been core to that system for more than a century . In response to \ntoday’s need for real -time settlement services, we are moving quickly to deliver the FedNow \nService . Decisions about interoperability  and pricing  across multiple providers are yet to come, \nbut the Federal Reserve’s h istory points to  a strong public policy focus on objectives for access, \nequity and safety  that will guide the answer to these questions . Importantly, t he FedNow S ervice \nwill support the innovative  solutions available to consumers and businesses today, and many \nmore I anti cipate are yet to be thought of, although they may only be just around the corner."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 6, 2019  \nNational Ass ociation for Business Economics  Annual Meeting  \nDenver, Colorado  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Thank you and welco me to Denver  — one of three branch cities in the Tenth Federal \nReserve District , headquartered  in Kansas City . Our Denver Branch  serves Colorado, Wyoming, \nand northern New Mexico  and provides valuable insight into local and regional economic \nconditions thr ough contacts and relationships fostered by our Branch staff and Board of \nDirectors . The Federal Reserve’s founders knew that the long -term success and credibility of the \ninstitution would rely on its ability to serve the diverse interests, geographies, an d industries that \nmake up the U.S. economy. By maintaining close regional relationships throughout our District, \nincluding Colorado, we are able to ensure that a regional perspective can be  represented at policy \nmeetings in Washington , D.C.  \nIn addition  to providing regional economic insights , the B ranch  engages in the \nsupervision and regulation of financial institutions, provides cash services to these institutions, \nand promotes financial education and community development through a variety of programs . \nOur Denver Branch is located just a few blocks from this location, and we hope that you’ll join \nus for a reception at the Branch tomorrow evening.  \nThis afternoon I would like to focus my remarks on how I view the Federal Reserve’s  \ninflation objective in relation to its dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment .1 \nAs I hear from many academics, financial market participants, and central bankers, there appears \nto be considerable angst over the fact that inflation has fallen persistently below t he Fed’s \ninflation objective of 2 percent . It has given rise to increased interest in alternative monetary \npolicy strategies that might better  anchor inflation at 2 percent and is one reason why the Federal \nReserve has embarked on a n unprecedented public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, \nand communications .  \n                                                 \n1 I would like to thank Kansas City Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these \nremarks.  \n\n \n \n2 \n Viewed from the perspective of Main Street , however, stakeholders show little concern \nabout  inflation run ning below the Fed’s target . They see t he U.S. economy is currently in a good \nplace . The unemployment rate is near a 50 -year low, inflation is low and stable, and the economy \nis growing near potential . In the midst of the longest business cycle expansion in history , \ninflation running a few tenths of a percent below 2 percent is , in itself, not a compelling \njustification for providing additional monetary policy accommodation.  \nIn my comments today, I will focus on three issues related to inflation dynamics, \nparticularly as they relate to the Fed’s  price stability mandate . First, wha t explains low i nflation \nin the United States? Second, is low inflation currently a problem? And third, to the extent low \ninflation is a problem, how should the Fed respond?  \n \nWhat Explains Low I nflation in the United States?  \nTo begin, let me discuss some of the factors that may be contribut ing to continued low \ninflation in the United States . As the economic expansion enters its 11th year, questions continue \nto linger whether inflation will eventually accelerate in the midst of an ever more mature \nexpansion .2 While the  dynamics of inflation during this expansion have surprised many \nobservers, including myself, my current outlook for inflation remains fairly benign .  \nThroughout much of this year, lower -than-expected readings on inflation, as measured by \nthe p ersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, have led 12 -month measures of \ninflation to decline relative to last year . PCE inflation currently stands at 1.4 percent as of August \n2019, down from 2.3 percent in August 2018. Core PCE inflation, which st rips out the volatile \nfood and energy components from the consumption basket, also moved lower over the past year. \n                                                 \n2 The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the start of the recovery in June 2009.  \n\n \n \n3 \n Core PCE inflation declined to 1.8 percent at an annual rate in August 2019 from 2.0 percent in \nAugust 2018 .  \nInflation moved lower over the past year despite the unemployment rate edging below 4 \npercent. This recent behavior of inflation suggests to me that factors other than the domestic \nlabor market may be driving inflation . For example, I see global inflationary trends as an \nimportant facto r keeping inflation pressures muted in the United States.  \nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  adopted  its numerical, longer -run \nobjective of a 2 percent annual change in the PCE price index in 2012 . Since then , this measure \nof U.S. inflation has aver aged about 1.4 percent. However, the United States  is not alone in terms \nof falling  short of its longer -run inflation target. Several other major foreign economies also have \nstruggled  to reach their longer -run inflation objectives, including the euro area and Japan.3 More \nbroadly across the globe, inflation declined throughout the last decade. Among nearly 200  \ncountries in the IMF’s database of international statistics, the share of co untries with inflation \nabove 2 percent has, in recent years, declined to levels last witnessed in the 1960s.4   \nWhile there are certainly some specific challenges shaping inflation in each economy, \nincluding where they stand in their own business cycle, th ese recent patterns suggest some \ncommon forces are likely keeping global inflation trends subdued . First, we’ve witnessed the \nwidespread adoption of inflation targets in advanced and emerging economies. As more central \nbanks pursue policies to keep inflati on low, other countries export less inflation globally . This \nfactor may be at work in the United States recently as import price inflation currently remains \n                                                 \n3 The United Kingdom is one advanced economy  that has recently experienced above target rates of inflation amid a \nrapid and large depreciation of their currency following the Brexit vote.  \n4 The International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics database and Federal Reserve Bank of Kans as \nCity research staff calculations. Of 193 countries  and areas , the share with a 3 -year moving average of inflation \nabove 2 percent declined from 97 percent at the end of 2008 to 51 percent as of the end of 2018 . While the database \ncovers 198 countries  and areas , data on inflation is missing for five of them.  \n\n \n \n4 \n lower than during 2004 -2007  — a  period in which  the unemployment rate also reached its \ncyclical lo w but inflation was running slightly above  2 percent .  \nSecond, changes in commodity price dynamics may have significant consequences for \nglobal inflation. Unlike past decades, the advent of nimble U.S. oil production seems  likely  to \nkeep energy prices in check even amidst oil supply disruptions and shortages . As a result, oil \nprice inflation has been lower in recent years than in the 2004 -2007 period, possibly helping \nexplain why the current low unemployment rate is failing to genera te as much inflation in the \nUnited States  as in past expansions. The global nature of commodity markets suggests that these \ndevelopments are likely to affect inflation outcomes in the United States as well as other \ncountries .  \nAnd third, the e -commerce ind uced disruption to global retail represents a global factor \nwhich may weigh on inflation, although its exact effects are difficult to quantify . Comparing to \nthe 2004 -2007 period, the share of U.S. retail sales accounted for by non -store retailers has \ndoubl ed from around 7 percent to nearly 15 percent. As major retailers compete for global \nmarket share, perhaps at the cost of margins, retail price inflation is likely to remain tame.  \nBeyond these longer -term global trends, the rapidly changing trade environm ent threatens  \nthe rise of global supply chains, and I see the persistent effects from the ongoing trade dispute as \ndisinflationary for the United States. In particular, the uneven effects of the changes in trade \npolicy on our trading partners, coupled with  the safety and security of the U.S. dollar in an era of \nuncertainty, has generally led to a rise in the foreign -exchange value of the dollar against other \ncurrencies. These forces, along with ongoing geopolitical risks, likely further reinforce d the \nstren gth in the U.S. dollar over the past year. As a result, I expect that global disinflationary \ntrends, embodied in low import price inflation, will continue to weigh on U.S. inflation.  \n\n \n \n5 \n In addition to  global factors, domestic factors also are at play . For example, recent \nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City highlights that, after growing rapidly at \nroughly 7  percent  per year over the 1980 -2004 period, college tuition prices have slowed \nmarkedly, averaging much closer to 2  percent  over the las t few years.5  Other staff analysis \nhighlights that inflation for medical care services, a fairly large and important component of the \npersonal consumption expenditure price index, has also been substantially weaker over the last \ndecade.6  These sector -specific factors, such as changes in state appropriations to higher \neducation or changes to the Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors, are important drivers of \nchanges in the inflation rates for these various components . Given that these idiosyncratic, \nsector-specific factors are unlikely to be directly affected by changes in labor market slack, some \ncomponents of inflation may remain muted even if the overall economy is operating at or near \npotential . Such factors are beyond the reach of monetary policy to  control.  \n \nIs Low Inflation Currently a P roblem?  \nWhile I have suggested a number of reasons why inflation has been low in the United \nStates, should we be concerned that inflation is running persistently a few tenths of a percent \nbelow the F ed’s objective o f 2 percent?  My answer to that question is based partly on my \ninteractions with business and community leaders but, in addition, depends on the broader \neconomic circumstances that coincide with low inflation.  \nAs I listen to business and community leaders  around my region, I hear few complaints \nabout inflation being too low. In fact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that \n                                                 \n5 Brent Bundick and Emily Pollard , “The Rise and Fal l of College Tuition Inflation ,” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City Economic Review, First Quarter, 2019 .  \n6 Presentation by A. Lee Smith at the BLS Data User’s Conference .  \n\n \n \n6 \n inflation is as low as measured in a number of key sectors. This leads me to the observation that \ninflation as experienc ed by households and businesses is fundamentally different from inflation \nas viewed by many financial market participants and economists. Households see the prices of \neveryday goods such as food, energy, rents, and health care rising and don’t understand w hy the \nFed would be concerned that inflation is too low. Their short -run expectations for inflation are \ndriven largely by changes in retail gasoline prices while their longer -run expectations, as \nmeasured by the University of Michigan, have been fairly sta ble. (Expected changes in prices \nduring the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 and 2.6 percent since April 2 016 and are \ncurrently at 2.4 percent.)  \nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power, \nsee their pro fit margins squeezed. For them, the product prices they charge are determined by \nstructural factors such as global competition and technological disruption that don’t necessarily \nrespond to monetary policy, while their costs are driven by tight labor and c ommodity market \nconditions. In the A ugust  survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most \nimportant problem, compared with 2 7 percent who said “qual ity of labor” and 9 percent who said \n“cost of labor.”   I would also point out that in the last NABE outlook survey (June 2019), your \noutlook panelists’  median forecast for core PCE price inflation for each quarter of 2020 was 2.0 \npercent at an annual rate  — right at the Fed’s longer -run objective.   \nPhilip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, summed it up well at our \nJackson Hole symposium when he said “…many people in our communities are incredulous that \nwe would be too worried over whether inflation was 1.6  per cent, 2.0  per cent or 2.2  per cent. \nThey ask, ‘haven’t you got something more important to worry about? ’”  \n\n \n \n7 \n Beyond this view of inflation from Main Street, I also keep in mind the Fed’s dual \nmandate . Unlike some central banks, we are t asked not only  with achieving price stability, but in \naddition, we have a mandate to achieve maximum employment . In circumstances where the \nunemployment rate is high and inflation is low, as was the case throughout much of the recovery \nfrom the Great Reces sion, policymakers typically ease policy to bring both variables in line with \ntheir longer -run objective s. Low inflation can be a symptom of economic slack, and \naccommodative policy tends to reduce unemployment and increase inflation . In these \ncircumstance s, the direction of policy is clear and policymaker consensus is relatively easy to \nachieve.  \nIn other circumstances  — such as we have today  — with both unemployment and \ninflation low relative to their longer -run objectives, the policy response is not so cl ear. On one \nhand, e asing policy might lift inflation, but at the cost of further tightening an already hot labor \nmarket  and perhaps fostering financial imbalances . And given the reduced responsiveness of \ninflation to economic slack, it might take a conside rable dose  of monetary accommodation to \nnudge inflation upward . On the other hand, tightening policy might limit the overheating of labor \nmarkets , but at the cost of putting further downward pressure on inflation.   \nIn these circumstances, where the objectives are not complementary, the FOMC ’s \nStatement on Longer -Run Goals  and Monetary Policy Strategies  lays out the framework of a  \n“balanced approach” in promoting them . In particular, we take into account the magnitude  of the \ndeviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are \nprojected to return to mandate -consistent levels .  \nNot surprisingly, under this balanced approach, there may be disagreement about a \nnumber of the factor s that determine appropriate policy . For example, policymakers may \n\n \n \n8 \n disagree about the amount of slack in labor markets or the relative costs of deviations of inflation \nand unemployment from their objectives . From my perspective, the deviation from our infl ation \nobjective is currently small, but given structural changes in inflation dynamics, trying to quickly \nreturn inflation to 2 percent by adjusting interest rates could require aggressive actions that \nwould misallocate resources and create financial imbal ances.  \nMy dissent at the last two FOMC meetings was based in part on balancing our objectives \nfor price stability and maximum employment . I dissented from the Committee’s  decision to \nlower the target range for the federal funds rate in July and September because the moderation of \neconomic growth in 2019 has been  in line with my own outlook that calls for a gradual decline to \na trend level over the medium term. With moderate growth, record low unemployment, and a \nbenign inflation outlook, maintaining an unch anged setting for policy would have been \nappropriate, in my view . There are certainly risks to the outlook as the economy faces trade \npolicy uncertainty and weaker global activity. Should incoming data point to a broadly weake r \neconomy, adjust ing policy may be appropriate to achieve  the Federal Reserve’s mandates for \nmaximum sustainable employment and stable prices.  \nBut in the absence of more evidence that the downside risks may be realized, muted \ninflation alone would not warrant a policy response . Rather  than focus ing too narrowly  on \nachieving a precise point target of 2 percent inflation , I find it more realistic  to accept that there \nwill be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target and, as long as they \ndon’t exceed  a reasonable threshold  — perhaps as big as 50 or even 1 00 basis points  —they \nshould be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions . Keeping our sights set on low \nand stable inflation  is key , with 2 percent as our North Star  and longer -run inflation o bjective.   \n \n\n \n \n9 \n When is Low Inflation a Concern and What Can Be Done About I t? \nSo when should  we be concerned about low inflation  and what can be done about it ?  As \nI’ve suggested, in current circumstances , concern about low inflation  seems unnecessary . While I \ndo not see a case for deliberately eas ing policy to boost inflation , the Fed’s 2 percent inflation \ntarget also should not be viewed as a ceiling . Rather, it seems reasonable to allow  modest \nunexpected shocks to  inflation  — perhaps stemming from import prices  — to demonstrate to the \npublic a commitment to achieving our inflation goal on a symmetric basis.  \nIn contrast, if conditions change so that the goals of policy are no longer in conflict, \npolicymakers should be prepared to adjust policy as necessary . For example, if weaker global \ndemand and trade policy uncertainty were to materially weaken my modal  outlook for growth , \nproviding additional monetary accommodation  may be warranted . Such a response to changing \neconomic conditions would support both the e conomic expansion and help offset further \ndownward pressure on inflation.  \nWere a more -severe downturn to hit the economy , policymakers are keenly aware that \nlittle policy space remains with the federal funds rate currently at 1¾ to 2  percent . The prospect \nof such a situation  makes  the Fed’s reevaluation of its policy strategies and objectives  a timely \nundertaking . The review has several parts, including a series of Fed Listens events around the \ncountry designed to help policymakers better understand the per spectives of people from diverse \nbackgrounds and with varied interests . In fact, we’ll host such an event in Kansas City  this week .  \nA few months ago , the Chicago Fed h eld a conference that brought together a distinguished \ngroup of academics, financial  market experts , and labor leaders  to share their p erspectives on \nhow the Federal Reserve can best achieve its mandate. Finally, the FOMC , supported by staff \nthroughout the Federal Reserve System, is devoting time at  its regular meetings to assess lessons \n\n \n \n10 \n learned in the aftermath of the Great Recession . Whether or not we ultimately make any changes \nto our framework, this review is essential in my view to the credibility of our decision -making, \nour commitment to transparency, and our collective learning abou t the changing landscape . I \nhope the exercise will become a regular feature of the Committee’s policy framework.   \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing , the U.S. economy is currently in a good place with low inflation, low \nunemployment, and an outlook for continued moder ate growth . In these circumstances, I am not \nconcerned that inflation is running a bit below our objective of 2 percent . Persistently muted \ninflation is the result of a confluence of temporary and structural factors that are not particularly \nresponsive to interest rate adjustments . Therefore, a degree of flexibility in how we interpret our \nprice stability mandate  seems appropriate . Should conditions change, however, and we find \nourselves again  at the zero lower bound, a fundamentally different strategy  may be needed . In \nanticipation of that possibility, now is a good time for a thorough review of policy strategies, \ntools, and communications."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 4, 2019  \nEconomic Forum  \nTahlequah, Oklahoma  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n  \nI am delighted to join you today.  \nI’d like to spend a few moments talking about the Feder al Reserve’s important \nconnection to Tahlequah . The history and design of our nation’s central bank is often \nmisunderstood, but is as important today as ever. Tahlequah is an especially appropriate location \nto discuss this history becau se events that occur red in this area more than a century ago had a \ndirect and significant impact on the Fed’s design.  \nAs you may know, sometime before  1880 a gentlem an named Robert L. Owen came to \nthe Tahlequah area as a teacher and supervisor of the Cherokee National School System.  The \nhistoric Owen School House, now known as the Park Hill/Owen Community Center, near the \nCherokee Heritage Center that bears his name.  \nAfter leaving the school, Owen  became a lawyer and practiced law not far from here in \nMuskogee where he organiz ed and served as president of the First National Bank for a decade.  In \n1907  he was elected one of Oklahoma’s first United States Senators, making him one of the first \ntwo Native Americans to serve in the Senate . \nHe joined  the Senate at a time of economic turmoil. Only a few weeks earlier,  the nation  \nexperienced  a financial crisis that would become known as the Panic of 1907. Soon  after, \nCongress began  discussions about how to improve the nation’s financial system, launching a \nprocess that would lead to the  Federal Reserve Act of 1913.  \nThere, Owen played a key role, serving as the legislation’s Senate sponsor and chair of \nthe Senate Banking Committee.  \nOwen’s 10 years in Oklahoma banking contributed importantly to his th inking about the \nrole of a central bank  and how it should be design ed. Owen was a banker during a particularly \nvolatile time for our nation’s banks and the U.S. economy. The panic of 1893 l ed to the closing \n\n \n2 \n of 500 banks. Owen later talked about  how he saw the problem s in the banking  sector during this \nperiod  ripple across the eco nomy, affecting property values, business failures and \nunemployment, which reached 25 percent or higher in some areas of the United States.  \nHe later wrote that the panic of 1893  “demonstrated the complete instability of the \nfinancial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly \ndefective banking system.”  \nHe had spent much time considering how to address these issues and, as fate would have \nit, was ideally suited to shape a solution when the opportunity was presented.  \n \nMISSION AREAS  \nBefore I talk about the structure, however,  it might be helpful to explain the full mission \nof the Federal Reserve.  \nAlthough monetary policy is likely the first thing that comes to mind when the Fed is \nmentione d, as the central bank of the United States , the Fed  has other responsibilities that focus \non the stability of our nation’s financial system.  \nWe are a banking supervisor with regulatory responsibilities that entail not only \nexamining depository institutions for financial fitness, but also ensuring that all customers are \noffered financial services on fair and appropriate terms. Here we focus on s uch matters as the \nability of borrowers to access the credit that may be necessary to fund an education, establish a \nbusiness or purchase a home.  \nWe are a bank for banks and also serve as the government’s bank .  This means we not \nonly hold deposits but we  are a provider of important services such as those necessary for the \nsmooth functioning of the payments system. This has included the processing of checks along \n\n \n3 \n with the use of other payment rails to transfer funds between depository institutions. Recentl y, \nyou may have seen some headlines about a new Fed initiative for real -time payments, a system \nwhich will expedite the actual flow of funds to match the speed with which consumers pay for \nthings using  apps on their phones or other online services . This i nitiative, which might be \nthought of as a high-tech plumbing network for the financial system, is the most substantial \ninnovation in payments in at least 40 years.  \nAnd, of course, there is our r ole in conducting the nation’s monetary policy , where we \nopera te under a directive from the U.S. Congress that is widely known as the Fed’s dual \nmandate: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and a maximum level of \nsustainable employment.  \nThe Fed relies on a substantial foundation of research in su pport of these operations. Th e \neconomists  who study a variety of economic issues include for example , our Oklahoma City \nBranch with particular expertise in the nation’s energy economy. Others are experts in banking, \nfinancial markets  and payments.  \n \nTHE FO UNDATION OF TODAY’S FED  \nAs I list these responsibilities, it is clear that there are many instances where the financial \nsystem has evolved in ways  that Owen and the Fed’s other c ongressional founders could not \nhave predicted.  \nFor example, w hen Congress was  debating the Federal Reserve Act, the gold standard \nwas literally the standard for the world’s most important currencies. That began to change \ninternationally during World War I and  changed  later in the United States. Th us monetary policy , \nas it is admini stered by the FOMC today under the delegation of Congres s, is an area that has \nseen significant change. In addition, t echnology has increased the pa ce of commerce around the \n\n \n4 \n globe . Meanwhile, innovation in financial products and services has fostered with it a \ncorresponding expansion of  risks.  \nIn the same way the authors of the Constitution could not plan for every eventuality, the \nframers of the Federal Reserve Act recognized that they were establishing a framework for a \ncentral bank that would have to  evolve if it would be capable of serving t he public interest.  \nIn terms of structure and governance, there were two main ideas  put forward during the \ndeliberations : On one side were those who supported a decentralized structure under the control \nof the pri vate sector; on the other side were those who believed  that the system should be highly \ncentralized under government control.  \nOwen , however,  believed in what might be considered a third option: He  was among \nthose who supported the idea of a balanced syste m where both sides could share in governance . \nWith a background in rural Oklahoma banking, Owen  had understandably strong opinions about \nthe potential risks associated with a central bank operating  under  Wall Street’s direct control. In \na debate on an earl y proposal that did not advance, Owen  voiced his concern about a system that \nwas “concentrated in any one city where a small clique could control ” it.  \nSuch an arrangement could present a couple of key risks. First, a closely aligned group of \nlike-minded l eaders might not have sufficient perspective for gauging risks since they would \nlikely have similar views.  For example, a group dominated by an East Coast perspective might \nnot have an appreciation for the full diversity of our banking system and the econ omy. No one \nhere needs to be told that the banking  needs of a Wall Street firm and a Tahlequah entrepreneur \nare very different.  \nThanks in part to Robert Owen,  we have a central bank structured in a manner that serves \nour nation well . General oversight of the Federal Reserve is through a government -appointed \n\n \n5 \n Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The 12 regional Reserve Banks, meanwhile, are \nindependent corporations that, along with their affiliated Branch offices, operate under the \nleadership of a local bo ard of directors.   \nCurrently, two Oklahoman s serve on the Board of Directors  of the Kansas City Fed’s \nhead office . Rose Washington, who some may know from her work as CEO of the Tulsa \nEconomic Development Corporation , currently serves as chair , while  Doug Stussi, with Love’s \nTravel Stops in Oklahoma City, is a director. Meanwhile, Susan Chapman Plumb from here in \nTahlequah is one of seven Oklahomans serving on the Board of our Oklahoma City Branch .  \nIn addition to their oversight roles , these directors are especially important to me in my \nrole representing the Tenth Federal Reserve District in FOMC policy deliberations. Along with \nour advisory councils and ot her local contacts, they are a source of information regarding \nemerging developments in banking and t he economy.  As intended by Robert Owen, t hey are the \ncritical link in ensuring that our nation’s central bank is not an isolated institution but one that \nconsiders the broad economic experience of all Americans . \nThis broad representation across the United  States  provides the regional Reserve Banks  \nwith a degree of protection against a risk that was recognized early in U.S. history by Alexander \nHamilton . That is  the risk that politicians could try to wield undue and dangerous influence over \nthe central bank . \nRobert Owen, a school teacher from Tahlequah, might not have imagined that the \ninstitution he shaped more than 100 years ago, would have proven so durable  amid  the economic \nand polit ical challenges it would face. But I think he would be pleased to see th at the Fed, by \ndesign , has a system that provides a forum for civil d iscourse about monetary policy and other \nimportant central bank issues.  And in my view, it continues to serve our nation well."

The FSPC oversees the \nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury  by the 12 \nFederal Reserve Banks.   I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth \nstatement on the role of the Federal Reserve in faster payments and the recently announced \nproposal by the Federal Reserve to support faster payments.  \nOver the past decade , cell phones and other online capabilities have made it more \nconvenient to send and re ceive payments .  Although the se mobile apps appear to provide for an  \nimmediate transaction, the underlying infrastructure is not designed to immediately  move money \nbetween banks , creating  notable delays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt .  \nTo support the demand for real -time payments in the United States and to address this \ngap, l ast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the Federal \nReserve Banks would develop a new service called the FedNow  Service .    \nSince its founding more than a century ago, t he Federal Reserve has p rovided payment \nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient \npayment system  for the nation .  Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important \noperational role and preparing to support the moderniz ation  of our nation’s p ayment system with \ncapabilities that allow payments to move quickly  through a safe and efficient foundation , on top \nof which innovation and competition can f lourish .  \nThis decision was made only after three established criteria were met.  \n\n2 \n \nThe first of these criteria is that it is a service that other providers alone cannot be \nexpected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity .  \nOf notable impo rtance  related to this criteri on is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect \nto more tha n 10,000 financial institutions.  Through these connections, the Federal Reserve ’s \nexisting  payment services allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of \ncommunities across the United States  with com petitive, fair and transparent access.  Providing \nthis degree of comprehensive nationwide reach is something that we  believe will present \nsignifican t challenges to other providers in the current market landsc ape.  Coming from a region \nof the country with a significant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the \ncentral United States, I can tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been \nwell received.  \nThe second criteri on is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the \nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments system risk.  \nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of \nthe U.S. payment system by providin g liquidity and operational continuity in response to \nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other crises.  The FedNow Service will \nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking \nsystem , as well as promote the development and implementation of industry -wide fraud -\nmitigation  standards.  Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment \nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.   \nThe final criteri on is that the  Federal Reserve be able to fully recover its cost over the \nlong run.   The U.S. payments infrastructure today includes alternative payment choices and \nproviders.  Today, t he Federal Reserve and The Clearing  House operate competing and \n\n3 \n \ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition.  In all of \nour services, we have been able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost \nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals.  In this regard, \neven as we develop the FedNow  Service , the Federal Reserve will continue to explore ways to \nsupport the market’s existing private -sector real -time payment service including through \nexpanded Fedwire Funds Service and Na tional Settlement Service hours as described in the \nrecent Federal Register notice . \nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the  Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has \nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the  nation’s \npayment system and its customers .1, 2  Last summer , the U.S. Treasury recommended that “ the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as through the \ndevelopment of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and \nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3  We are engaging now with stakeholders \nfor their input on features of the FedNow Service through the Federal Register notice issued last \nmonth.   \nFinally , I found it gratifying after the Fed eral Reserve  started the conversation about \nfaster payments in the U .S. and led four years of stakeholder engagement that culminated in the \noverwhelming majority of 400 comments from industry, consumer, and small business \nexpressing  support  for the Fed eral Reserve ’s role as a faster payments provider .   \n                                                           \n1 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office.

I am happy to respond to  your questions.  \n\n \n \nFaster Payments and the U.S. Payment System  \nThe U.S. payment system faces a critical juncture in its evolution.  Services to conduct \nfaster payments, which are available via smart phones apps or on our computers, have begun to \nemerge along with the growth of digital commerce.  Faster payments allow individuals and \nbusinesses to send and receive payments within seconds, any time of day, on any day of the year, \nsuch that the receiver can use the funds almost instantl y.  The round -the-clock, real -time nature \nof faster payments offers convenience that is not available with many traditional ways of making \npayments .  In addition, faster payments can yield real economic benefits for individuals and \nbusinesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and allowing them to \nmake time -sensitive payments whenever needed .   \nYet with many of the faster payment services available today, the underlying \ninfrastructure is not designed to immediately move money between banks, creating notable \ndelays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt .  These shortcomings limit the \ndegree to which the potential benefits of faster payment services may be widely enjoyed across \nour economy in a safe manner.  Further expansion of the  interbank infrastructure is needed to  \nserve as the foundation for the development of faster payment services that are safe, efficient, \nand broadly accessible to the American public.    \nLast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  (Board)  announced that the \nFederal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) would develop a new service called the FedNowSM \nService to support widespread adoption of faster  payments  in the United States .  The FedNow \nService will provid e the necessary infrastructure, alongside similar services provided by the \nprivate sector, t o connect banks across the country , allowing them to offer innovative faster \npayment services to their customers. \n\n- 2 - \n \nSince its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a key operational role in the nation’s \npayment system by providing interbank payment infrastructure that is available to bank s across \nthe country, regardless of size or location.  This critical r ole, given  by Congress, stems from  the \nFederal Reserve’s unique ability, as the nation’s central bank, to provide interbank settlement \nwithout introduc ing liquidity or credit risks.  In today’s  payment infrastructure, whether in check \nprocessing,  automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers , you will see a     \nFederal Reserve service operating in healthy competition with and in support of similar services \nprovided by the private  sector , all for the benefit of the American public .   \nThe importance of this ro le has been recognized  broadly , with an independent review by \nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office concluding that the Federal Reserve’s provision of \npayment services has benefited the U.S.  payment system and its users.1  It is important to point \nout, however, that Congress did not grant plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the \nU.S. payment system to the  Federal Reserve , and the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory \nauthority over the pricing set by a private -sector system or to require a private -sector system to \nextend the service to banks of all sizes.  In some other countries, central banks have been \nassigned the  responsibility for regulating p ayment systems.   In the United States, this is not the \ncase.  Thus , the Federal Reserve has historically helped to promote the accessibility, safety, and \nefficiency of the nation’s payment system  and advance innovations through its operational role \nas provider of payment and settlement services.    \n  \n \n                                                           \n1 See U.S. Gov ernmen t Accountability Off ice, GAO -16-614, “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers \nBenefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase Assurance of Cost Accuracy” (2016) .  Available at \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO -16-614. \n \n\n- 3 - \n \n Path to Present  \nLeading up to the recent FedNow Service decision  and announcement  in August , the \nFederal Reserve took several actions to facilitate the advancement of faster payments in the \nUnited States.  In 2013, the Federal Reserve began a collaborative initiative with industry \nstakeholders to foster improvements to the nation’s payment system.  As part of th is initiative, \nthe Federal Reserve convened in 2015 the Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF), comprising a \nwide range of industry stakeholders, to identify and evaluate alternative approaches for \nimplementing safe and ubiquitous faster payment capabilities in the Unit ed States.  \nThe FPTF published in 2017 a set of consensus recommendations focused on actions to \nsupport improvements to the nation’s payment system.2  Among the FPTF’s recommendations \nwere req uests for the Federal Reserve (1 ) to develop a 24x7x365 settleme nt service to support \nfaster payments and ( 2) to explore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operational \nrole(s) in faster payments.  Subsequently, t he U.S. Department of the Treasury recommended \nthat “the Federal Reserve move quickly to facilita te a faster retail payments system, such as \nthrough the development of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more \nefficient and ubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3 \n                                                           \n2 These recommendations were intended to help achieve the FPTF’s vision of ubiquitous faster payment capabilities \nin the United States that would  allow any end user (that is, an individual or business) to safely, efficiently, and \nseamlessly send a faster payment to any other end user, no matter which banks or payment services they use.  See \nFaster Payments Task Force, “Final Report Part Two: A Call to Action,” (July 2017).  Available at \nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/ wp-content/uploads/faster -payments -task-force -final-report -part-two.pdf .  \n3 The U.S. Department of the Treasury also noted that “[i]n particular, smaller financial institutions, like community \nbanks and credit unions, should also have the ability to access  the most -innovative technologies and payment \nservices. While Treasury believes that a payment system led by the private sector has the potential to be at the \nforefront of innovation and allow for the most advanced payment system in the world, back -end Fed eral Reserve \npayment services must also be appropriately enhanced to enable innovations.” U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System \nThat Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and Innovation,” (July 2018) at 156.  Available \nat https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018 -07/A -Financial -System -that-Creates -Economic -Opportunities ---\nNonbank -Financi.pdf . \n\n- 4 - \n \n The Federal Reserve also has directly supported the development of private -sector real-\ntime gross settlement (RTGS) services for faster payments.  The Board approved in 2017 final \nguidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks intended to facilitate \nsettlement between and among banks participating in private -sector payment systems for faster \npayments.4  The impetus for allowing broader use of joint accounts was to support these private -\nsector arrangements . \n In November 2018, the Board published a Federal  Register notice (2018 Notice) \nrequesting comment on two potential actions  that could be taken  by the Federal Reserve  \nconsistent with the FPTF recommendations : (1) a service for 24x7x365 real -time interban k \nsettlement of faster payments ; and (2 ) a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers \nbetween accounts held at Reserve Banks on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real -time \ninterbank settlement of faster payments.   \nThe Board explained that a Federal Reserve  RTGS service for fa ster payments, alongside \nprivate -sector RTGS services, would provide the infrastructure needed to achieve ubiquitous, \nsafe, and efficient faster payments in the United States.  Other parties, such as banks, payment \nprocessors, and providers of payment serv ices, could utilize this platform as a basis for \ninnovation to meet the specific needs of the business es and households they serve .  The Board \nfurther explained that a liquidity management tool, in turn, could help alleviate liquidity \nmanagement issues for  banks engaged in RTGS -based faster payments , notably those utilizing \nsettlement services offered by the private sector .  In particular, such a tool would enable \n                                                           \n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” (Issued \n2017).  Available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/p aymentsystems/joint_requests.htm .  In 2016, Federal Reserve \nstaff received a request from a private -sector service provider to open a new joint account for that organization’s \nproposed faster payment system.  The use of a joint account at a Reserve Bank to  support settlement mitigates \ncertain risks by reproducing, as closely as possible, the risk -free nature of settlement in central bank money.  \n\n- 5 - \n \n movement of funds between accounts at the Reserve Banks during hours when traditional \npayment and settlement services are currently not open to allow liquidity to be moved, when \nneeded, to an account or accounts used to support real -time settlement of faster payments.  The \n2018 Notice proposed that the tool could be provided by expanding operating hours of current \nFederal Reserve services or through a new service.  \nIn the 2018 Notice, the Board requested comment on the appropriateness of real -time \ngross settlement as the strategic foundation for faster payments in the United States and the \npublic benefits, implications, and challenges of the Federal Reserve taking ei ther, both, or neither \nof the potential actions.  \nConsideration of Comments and Policy As sessment  \nThe Board received over 400 comment letters  representing over 800 entities  in response  \nto the 2018 Notice.  Comments were submitted by a wide variety of stake holders in the U.S. \npayment system,  including community banks,  individuals, consumer organizations, merchants, \nservice providers, private -sector operators, fintech companies, trade organizations, and other \ninterested parties.5  Consistent with the diversity of the payment industry, commenters \nrepresented a broad range  of viewpoints.  \nAlmost all commenters addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve  should \ndevelop a  real-time interbank settlement s ervice for faster payme nts.  The vast majority  of these \ncommenters , representing nearly every stakeholder segment, supported the Federal Reserve \n                                                           \n5 Overall, banks were the largest group of respondents, with community banks (small and midsize banks) \ncomprising  approximately 60 percent of the total comments —the largest specific segment —and representing \ninstitutions from 34 states.  \n\n- 6 - \n \n taking this action.   In contrast, large banks, some trade organizations, and private -sector \noperators were generally not supportive of  the Federal Reserve developing such a service.6  \nIn reaching its decision to offer the FedNow Service, the Board was informed by these \npublic comments  and the history of the U.S. payment system , in which the Federal Reserve has \nplayed a role since its inception .  In addition, any decision by the Board to offer a new payment \nservice is subject to the factors set out in longstanding Federal Reserve polic y, and the pricing of \nReserve Bank services is subject to the requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980 .7  \nSpecifically, in considering new services, the Board assesses three criteria: whether the service is \none that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, \nscope, and equity ; whether the service will yield a clear public benefit ; and whether the     \nFederal Reserve will achieve full cost recovery over the long run .8  \nOther Providers Criterion  \n Through this assessment , the Board has concluded that other providers alone cannot be \nexpected to provide an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments with reasonable effectiveness, \nscope, and equity.  So far, only one private -sector RTGS service for faster payments has been \nestablished in the United States.  Due to coordination challenges and the high f ixed costs \nnecessary to develop a new payment and settlement service, this service is expected to re main \nthe sole private -sector RTGS service for faster payments in the United States.   The ability of a \n                                                           \n6 Approximately half of the commenters discussed the liquidity management tool, with almost all supporting the \nFederal Reserve offeri ng such a tool.    \n7 In 1984, the Board established criteria for the consideration of new or enhanced Federal Reserve payment services \nin its policy The Federal Reserve in the Payment System.  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The \nFederal R eserve in the Payments System,” (Issued 1984; revised 1990).  Available at \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm . \n8 In addition, the Board performs a competitive impact analysis when considering an operational or legal change to a \nReserve Bank service or price that would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other providers \nof services to compete w ith the Reserve Banks.   \n\n- 7 - \n \n sole private -sector provider to extend  access to a few  thousand banks, let alone the more than \n10,000 diverse banks necessary to achieve true nationwide scope, would be costly and time -\nconsuming given that the existing service has l imited relationships with and connections to these \ninstitutions.  \nIn addition,  the Board concluded that the private -sector operator alone cannot be \nexpected to provide the service with reasonable effectiveness , as viewed through the lens es of \nsafety and efficiency .  From a safety perspective, a sole provider may serve as a single po int of \nfailure in the market for RTGS -based faster payments .  From an efficiency perspective, a market \nwith only a single operator may cause challenges related to competition, innovation, and market \nfragmentation .  According to established economic theory and experience from other markets, a \nsingle service provider not facing competition can yield undesirable outcomes, such as higher \nprices or lower service quality.  Such undesirable outcomes could limit adoption of faster \npayments by end users, which could in turn curtail efficiency benefits to the broader economy.  \nPublic Benefits Criterion  \n The Board also determined that the FedNow  Service will yield a clear public benefit. \nSince its inception, an underlying public  policy rationale for the Federal Reserve’s involvement \nin the payment system has been to provide services in a safe and efficient manner to banks \nnationwide.  Because of this long -standing policy commitment, the Federal Reserve has \nhistorically extended a ccess to banks of all sizes, including smaller banks in rural and remote \nareas of the country.   The Federal Reserve’s  relationships with and  connections to thousands of \nbanks across the country provide a solid foundation for the FedNow Service to facilitat e those \nbanks gaining access to an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments, which would benefit small \nand midsize banks and the communities they serve.   \n\n- 8 - \n \n In a payment system with multiple operators, banks would have a choice whether to join \na single service  or multiple services.  An RTGS infrastructure could, therefore, achieve \nnationwide reach in two main ways, either through interoperability via direct exchange of \npayments between operators, such as in the U.S. ACH system, or through at least one service \nconnecting to virtually all banks, such as in the funds transfer system.  \nThe FedNow  Service would promote payment system safety in multiple ways.  As noted \nby commenters, the Federal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the \nsafety  of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response \nto financial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other crises.  As the prominence of \nfaster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow  Service would allow \nthe Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking system and \nthe broader economy in times of crisis .  In addition, as the operator of the service , the        \nFederal Reserve would be in a position to promote the development and implementation of \nindustry -wide fraud -mitigation standards, which commenters highlighted are especially \nimportant for real -time p ayments .  The development of the service could also enhance the safety \nof the U.S. payment system by promoting resiliency through redundancy.  \nFinally, the FedNow  Service could provide efficiency benefits by serving as a platform \nfor innovation and the dev elopment of end -user services  by the private sector .  In addition, an \nRTGS infrastructure with nationwide reach would make the development of new faster payment \nservices based on real -time settlement more attractive, increasing innovation and competition i n \nthe market for end -user faster payment services.  Such c ompetition could yield efficiency \nbenefits by leading to lower prices and higher service quality.  \n \n\n- 9 - \n \n Cost Recovery Criterion  \nThe Board expects that the FedNow  Service will achieve full recovery of costs over \nthe long run .  The MCA requirement to require cost recovery “over the long run” is not \nassociated with a specific timeframe.  Beginning in 1995, the Board adopted a convention \nof evaluating long -run cost recovery for existing services using a ro lling 10 -year period.  At \nthat time, Federal Reserve  services were in mature states, characterized by widespread \nadoption by banks of all sizes throughout the country, with relatively stable volumes and \ncosts.  At other times, notably as the ACH service wa s evolving, the Board considered long \nrun over an extended time period in order to encourage the adoption of electronic payments \nfor the benefit of the economy.9  \nGiven the time frame necessary to create a broad network of banks  connecting to the \nservice , the Board determined that  a longer time frame for cost recovery is consistent with \nthe intent of the MCA to encourage the adoption of new services that have the potential to \nbring widespread economic benefits to the country.  \nExpanded H ours for Existing S ervices  \nThe second proposed action in the 2018 Notice entailed the exploration of  the expansion \nof operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service , which is our existing funds transfer service, \nand National Settlement Service  (NSS) hours, which is our servic e that supports private -sector \nnet settlement arrangements, potentially up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity management , \nnotably for users  of private -sector RTGS services.  \n                                                           \n9 ACH began as a Federal Reserve service in the 1970s, prior to the passage of the MCA.  In 1981 , when the pricing \nprinciples were first applied to ACH, the Board recognized that the ACH service was still evolving and allowed fees \nto be set based on mature volume costs rather than current costs for a number of years and only at the end of that \ntime began marking 10 -year cost recovery.  The Board concluded that doing so would result in a more efficient \npayment mechanism and was consi stent with the MCA.  See 46 FR 1343 (Jan uary 6, 1981).     \n\n- 10 - \n \n As described in the 2018 Notice, RTGS -based faster payment services require bank s to \nhave sufficient liquidity positioned in a specified account to perform interbank settl ement at any \ntime, on any day.  Without sufficient liquidity so available to conduct settlement, a faster \npayment cannot be completed in an RTGS -based service where,  by design, interbank settlement \noccurs before final funds can be made available to the receiver.  At present, the Federal Reserve \ndoes not provide a service that would provide a means to position additional liquidity in the \nspecified account  outside stand ard business hours .  In light of these considerations, in its 2018 \nNotice the Board proposed developing a liquidity management tool that could help address these \nneeds  by facilitating transfers to and from other accounts held by participants at Federal Res erve \nBanks . \nIn response to the 2018 Notice, several large banks and other commenters indicated that \nthe proposed tool could help with managing liquidity in the recently established private -sector \nRTGS service for faster payments.  The private -sector RTGS s ervice is supported by funds in a \njoint account at a Reserve Bank, and the proposed liquidity management tool would enable \nmovement of funds between a joint account and banks’ reserve accounts during hours when \nexisting services are not currently open.  Commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve should \nprovide this tool through expansion of operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service.   \nCommenters also noted that expanded Fedwire Funds Service hours, and relatedly, NSS \nhours, could provide benefits f or a variety of payment activities beyond those related to faster \npayments.  Payment activity supported by expanded hours could include additional settlement \nwindows for the ACH service and wholesale payment activity in global markets.  Because of the \nsystemic importance of the Fedwire Funds Service, in particular, additional risk, operational, and \n\n- 11 - \n \n policy analysis is required for this action, and the draft notice indicates the Federal Reserve’s \nintention to engage actively with the industry to conduct this analysis.   \nThe FedNow  Service  \nAs explained in the August announcement, t he FedNow Service would conduct real -time, \npayment -by-payment, settlement of interbank obligations through debits and credits to banks’ \nbalances in accounts at the Reserve Banks.  Real-time settlement in accounts at the Reserve \nBanks means that settlement occurs without liquidity or credit risks, which enhances the safety \nof these payments.  The FedNow S ervice would incorporate clearing functionality, allowing \nbanks, in the process of settling each payment, to exchange information needed to make debits \nand credits to the accounts of their customers.  The service’s functionality would support banks’ \n(or th eir agents’) provision of end -to-end faster payments to their customers.  \nUltimately, the FedNow Service will provide, alongside similar private -sector services, \ncore infrastructure to promote ubiquitous, safe, and efficient faster payments in the United St ates.  \nIn fact, for all payment systems in our country, no single private -sector provider has ever \nachieved nationwide reach on its own .  With the FedNow Service, banks will now have a choice  \nin providers or could choose to use both a Federal Reserve and p rivate -sector service for back -up \npurposes, as some do today for check, ACH, and wire services.  \nThe Federal Reserve  recognize s that time -to-market is an important consideration \nexpressed by many commenters in response to the 2018 Notice.  Our objective is  to implement \nthe service as soon as practicably possible.  However, th e achievement of true nationwide reach \nover the long term, as opposed to initial availability of a service, is the most important measure \nof success for faster payments.  \n\n- 12 - \n \n At the same ti me as the Board published its decision regarding the new service, the Board \nrequest ed public comment on how the FedNow  Service might be designed to most effectively \nsupport the full set of payment system stakeholders and the functioning of the broader U.S. \npayment system.  In the same notice , the Board also announc ed its intention to explore the \nexpansion of Fedwire Funds Service  and NSS hours, up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity \nmanagement in private -sector real -time gross s ettlement services for faster payments and to \nsupport a wide range of payment activities, beyond those related to faster payments.  \nThe Board’s important decision to approve a new payment service  comes over 40 years \nafter the last service, A CH, was approved for implement ation back in the 1970s .  The decision to \nestablish A CH came at a pivotal moment when the industry was overwhelmed by the volume of \npaper checks, and the new technology at that time allowed for what is essentially an electronic \nversion of paper checks.  Remarkable  new technology enables the Federal Reserve  to support the \nfinancial  sector in offering an ever -growing array of options  24x7 x365  in a safe and efficient \nmanner .  Providing such payment services is very much consistent with our historical role in the \npayment system , one that has helped banks to meet the needs of business and households  in a \ngrowing economy for over a century ."

            "content": "Statement by \nEsther George  \nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \non behalf of  \nThe Federal Reserve System  \nbefore the  \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  \nUnited States Senate  \n \n \nSeptember 25 , 2019  \n \n \n\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the Committee,  thank you for \nthis opportunity.  \nChair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank \nleader responsible for  the Federal Reserve’s payments improvement initiative since its beginning \nand as chair of the Finan cial Services Policy Committee  (FSPC) .  The FSPC oversees the \nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury  by the 12 \nFederal Reserve Banks.   I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth \nstatement on the role of the Federal Re serve in faster payments and the recently announced \nproposal by the Federal Res erve to support faster payments through the  develop ment of  a new \nservice called the FedNow  Service .    \nSince the Federal Reserve’s founding more than a century ago it  has p rovid ed payment \nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient \npayment system .  Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important operational role and \npreparing to support the moderniz ation  of our natio n’s p ayment system with capabilities that \nallow payments to move quickly  through a safe and efficient foundation , on top of which \ninnovation and competition can flourish .  \nThis decision was ma de only after three criteria were met.  \nThe first of these crite ria is that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide the \nservice with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity .  \nOf notable importance  related to this criteri on is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect \nto more tha n 10,000 financial institutions.  Through these connections, our  existing  payment \nservices allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of communities across the \nUnited States  with com petitive, fair and transparent access.  Providing comprehen sive \n\n2 \n \nnationwide reach is something that we  believe will present significan t challenges to other \nproviders in the current market landscape.  Coming from a region of the country with a \nsignificant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the ce ntral United States, I \ncan tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been well received.  \nThe second criteri on is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the \nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments s ystem risk.  \nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of \nthe U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response to \nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other cr ises.  The FedNow Service will \nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking \nsystem , as well as promote the development and implementation of industry -wide fraud -\nmitigation  standards.  Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment \nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.   \nThe final criteri on is that the Fed be able to fully recover its cost over the long run.  \nThe U.S. payments infrastructu re today includes alternative payment choices and \nproviders.  The Federal Reserve and The Clearing  House today operate competing and \ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition.  In all of \nour services , we have bee n able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost \nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals.  We fully \nexpect this will be the case with the FedNow  Service . \nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has \nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the nation’s \n\n3 \n \npayment system and its customers1, 2  Last summer , the U.S. Treasury recommended that “ the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system.”3   \nWe are engaging now with stakeholders for their input on features of the FedNow Service \nthrough the Federal Regi ster notice issued last month.  \nI am confident that together we can achieve our public policy objectives for broad ly \naccess ible, safe  and efficient faster payments.   \nThank you.  I am happy to respond to  your questions.  \n                                                           \n1 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office.

            "content": "Opening Remarks  by Esther L. George  \nAt the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium , \n“Challenges  for Monetary Policy ” \nAugust 22, 2019  \n \nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to beautiful Jackson Hole, Wyoming and to the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s economic symposium titled “Challenges \nfor Monetary Policy.”   \n \nI am pleased to be joined by Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as \nmany of my current and former colleagues from the Federal Reserve; and by other \ncentral bankers, academics, and policymakers from around the globe.   \n \nThis year marks the 43rd economic symposium , and with its long history comes an \nassociation with m any distinguished individuals. Sadly, we lost two such \nindividuals this year, both of whom were significant contributors to t he discussion \nin Jackson Hole. And because of that, I want to  take a moment  to remember Alan \nKrueger and Marty Feldstein for their important contributions  and for their \nfriendship . \n \nAlan Krueger joined us at several symposiums both as chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers and as a professor at Princeton University. He was always a \ngracio us and thoughtful participant. Those who were with us here last year will \nrecall that Alan was the featured luncheon speaker and offered keen insights on \nchanges in worker bargaining power and implications for monetary policy.  \n \n\nMarty and Kate Feldstein attended many s ymposiums here, and Marty was on the \nprogram some 18 times. His influential contributions to the economics profession  \nand to public service will long be remembered.  He was a wonderful mentor and \nwe are grateful for his advice and input over the years as we considered  topics and \nspeakers  for this program .  \n \nAlan Krueger and Marty Feldstein were exceptional in many ways , and both of \nthem will be greatly missed.  \n \nAs we considered the topic for this year’s symposium, we were mindful that a \ndecade beyond the global financial crisis, central bankers face a range of \nchallenges as they pursue their mandates. Differen ces in econ omic conditions \nacross countries have contributed to a divergence in policy path s with implications \nfor exchange rates, trade, and ultimately economic activity. The buildup and \neventual unwinding of balance sheet policies have implications for capital mark ets \nand fina ncial flows between countries. And a s central banks have looked to \nnormaliz e policy settings, the prospect of lower neutral rates of interest has \nemerged across the globe. While charting a course to pursue their mandates under \nthese circumstances, central banks also must take into account the influences of \ncommodity and financial markets.   \n \nWithout question, it’s a complex ecosystem in which central bank ers seek an \nequilibr ium. And o ur setting here in the Grand Teton National Park  is perhaps the \nideal place to contemplate such challenges given the very c omplex natural  \necosystem  that exists here .   \n \n\nYou will find that t he national park is home to a variety of species – elk, m oose, \nbison, and grizzly bears to name a few. These animals co-exist  in an equilibrium \nthat provides mutual benefits when they respect each other’s territory. As the park \nrangers will tell you , some of the se animals establish large territories referred to as \nhome ranges. When the home ranges of different animals overlap , or one animal \nintrudes on another’s territory, things get a little more interesting.  That said, the \npark rangers assure me  that such encounters or even aggression are generally \nresolved  without bloodshed , typically with retreat of the intruder.  \n \nWe also know that n atural ecosystems are quite sensitive to change and restoring \nthe e quilibrium after a disruption can prove challenging . Earlier this week, I \nattended a talk hosted here at the Jackson Lake L odge that also may provide \nlessons for the ecosystem in which central bankers operate. In this talk, the speaker \nreviewed the history of Grizzly bears  in Yellowstone. He explained that, a s the \nrailroad was constructed across Wyomi ng in the 1800s , hotels began to spring up \nto provide accommodation s for travelers.   \n \nAfter serving meals, t he hotel kitchens would toss out the scraps a short distance \nfrom the kitchen door , which  as you might imagine,  eventually attracted the grizzly \nbears. A s it turned out, the tourists quite enjoyed watching the bears feed and at \nfirst, it seemed harmless, even beneficial – but there  were unintended \nconsequences. The bears began to prefer this new source of food to the detriment \nof their health a nd the safety of the tourists. Eventually, the park service put a stop \nto this practice with a difficult transition to a new equilibrium – getting the \ngrizzlies to return to their natural diet. And to preserve the restored equilibrium , \nyou will find today clea rly posted across the national park  a very familiar sign : Do \nnot feed the bears.  \n\n \nWhether or not central bankers can actually draw any lessons from this natural \necosystem,  I highly recommend while you’re here that you do not feed the bears \nand avoid encounters with them while hiking in their territory.  \nAgain, thank you for coming , and  I look forward to the presentation s and \ndiscussion s of the excellent papers prepared for this year’s program and the \ninsights from all of you on the challenges for monet ary policy ."

I want to  thank the organizers and , in particular , Már and the Central \nBank of Iceland for inviting me to participate in this program.  It is timely to consider the lessons \nlooking back and to continue to do the hard work of implementing needed cha nge to secure and \npreserve monetary and financial stability. Preserving  that stability is especially important today \nas central banks work within more limited policy space and , to varying degrees , under challenges \nto independence.  \nThis month marks th e tenth year of expansion of the U.S. economy, now the longest \neconomic expansion in its history.  This long period of expansion has been one of generally \nmoderate growth , but also a period during which the stance of monetary policy remained \naccommodative  for many years,  only recently approaching what appears to be a neutral level.  \nThe unemployment rate, currently at 3.7 percent, remains below most assessments of its long -run \nnatural level and stands in stark contrast to its peak of 10 percent nearly a decade ago. Inflation \nhas remained low and relatively stable throughout this period even as labor markets tightened, \nwages moved higher and domestic demand grew . After years of accommodative policy, the U.S. \neconomy appears to be performing reasonably well  notwithstanding the emerging downside risks  \ncoming from slower global growth and trade policy uncertainty.  Even as the U.S. economy has \nachieved a degree of stability , the prolonged low rate environment accompanied by \nunconventional policy has increased risk appetites  and influenced asset values.  And signs of \nfinancial imbalances are growing, while capital in the nation’s largest banking organizations is \nnot.  \nSecuring economic and f inancial stability for the long -run health  of the macroeconomy  \nrequires balancing monetary policy calibration with an understanding of potential vulnerabilities \nin the financial system . This remains a focus in the United States. My comments today will look \n\n \n2 \n at the nature of current financial vulner abilities  and the challenges I see associated with \nresponding to those vulnerabilities at this stage of the expansion.    \n \nThe Expanded Regulatory Toolkit  \n Following the 2008 -09 financial crisis, massive regulatory change came from legislation \nknown as the 2010 Dodd -Frank Act  and revamped supervisory approaches and keener attention \nto financial stability. Among improvement s in U.S. bank regulatory policy and the  tools \nimplemented to evaluate and promote financial stability , the supervisory stress tests have been a \nkey innovation for assessing the level of capital  in the banking system . This analytical exercise \nprovides a quantitative and comprehensive process for evaluating the sufficiency of an individual  \nbank’s capital , as well as aggregate levels of capita l in the system,  to offset losses that stem from \na simulated stress  environment.  In addition  to stress testing , regulatory capital requirements for \nthe largest banks have been strengthened through more rigorous risk -weighting approaches and \nincreased l everage capital requirements.  To address cyclical concerns about financial stability \nrisk, the Federal Reserve now has the authority to impose a countercyclical capital buffer \n(CCyB ) requirement on the largest banks.  On the other hand, its authorities  related to its role as \nlender of last resort were constrained.  \n Regulatory changes for the largest banks also have  improved their liquidity cushions . \nThese firms  now hold a larger amount of high -quality liquid assets  and must routinely \ndemonstrate their ability to meet short -term liquidity demands . Efforts are underway to develop  \nrequirement s to address longer -term liquidity risk.   \nIn addition, U.S. regulators implemented structural reforms in derivatives markets, \nincluding promotion of central clearing and swap execution facilities, margin requirements, \n\n \n3 \n improved reporting , and bank capital rules for derivatives . Money market mutual fund \nregulations were implemented to reduce run risk in these funds.  Finally, the Finan cial Stability \nOversight Council was formed along with the Office of Financial Research.  \nTaken  together, t hese changes undoubtedly have improved the overall health  and \nresiliency  of the U.S. financial system . Whether these steps will prove robust to a fut ure shock \nhowever has yet to be tested.   \n \nIdentifying Vulnerabilities  \nIdentifying vulnerabilities has taken on renewed focus. To that end, t he Federal Reserve  \npublishes its assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the economy twice  each year.  The \nframework used by the Fed looks at vulnerabilities across four dimensions:  1) asset valuations; \n2) household and business debt; 3) leverage in the financial sector; and 4) funding risks.   \nThe most recent financial stability report highlights a variety of r isks and vulnerabilities.  \nAmong them, for example, corporate leverage in the United States  has grown rapidly and is at a \nrecord level. The amount of outstanding debt among the corporate sector in the United States  has \ngrown to an unprecedented amount durin g the long expansionary period. Non -financial \ncorporations now have approximately $6 trillion in outstanding debt, roughly twice the amount \nof debt outstanding at the beginning of the expansion. Much of the growth in corporate debt \noutstanding is due to bo rrowing by firms that were already highly leveraged.  \nThe ratings for many of these corporate bonds are at the margin of investment grade and \nare at risk of being downgraded if economic conditions were to deteriorate.  In addition, the \nstandards for leverag ed corporate loans have declined steadily in recent years as loan structures \nand covenants have weakened.  \n\n \n4 \n With much of the recent growth in leveraged borrowing funded by non -bank lenders, \nvulnerabilities that originate outside the banking sector could pos e substantial challenges for both \nthe macroeconomy and U.S. banks during times of financial stress. Close links between the \ntraditional banking sector and the so -called shadow banking sector are evident, but not well -\nunderstood. However, d isruptions in the  corporate debt markets are likely to flow through these \nlinks and raise demands for short -term funding from banks during a period of market stress . A \ndecline in investor demand for corporate debt could also create loan syndicate pipeline risk and \ndownward  pressure on values that would have adverse impacts on banks.  More broadly, a \ndisruption in corporate debt markets could cause broader spillover effects on other assets classes, \nwhere values are currently elevated, adversely impacting overall bank health a nd the \nmacr oeconomy . For this reason, a focus on the stability of the banking system is essential .  \nIdentifying risks  is clearly important. Equally important  is understanding what tools are \nat our disposal to address such concerns.  In the case of the United States , this is very much a \nwork in progress .  \n In my view, monetary policy settings are not well suited to react, notwithstanding the \neffect it may have in influencing the conditions around risk and investor’s reach for yield.  And, it \nseems to me,  macroprudential approaches are desirable in theory but face considerable challe nge \naround the age -old issues of being delivered timely and potently , at least in the  United States’ \nexperience. O ther countries have different macroprudentia l loan-to-value  measures  to use .  \nWithin the Federal Reserve , a number of my colleagues and I participated in a tabletop  \nexercise a few years ago.  The exercise w as designed to assess the efficacy  of certain \nmacroprudential tools in responding to a hypothetical financial crisis. In the exercise, we \nexamined the use of capital -based, liquidity -based, and credit -based tools, along with stress \n\n \n5 \n testing and supervisory guidance in mitigating the effects  of an overheating of the financial \nmarkets. What we discovered in conducting the exercise was that the effectiveness of the tools \nvaried because of realities like implementation lags and/or limited scope.  Clearly, this particular \nexercise is not conclusiv e in all scenarios, but it cautions against becoming overly confident in \nrelying on macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances.1  \n I’d like to mention two potential macroprudential approaches in play: the CCyB and \nstress testing.   \n The CCyB,  as I noted earlier, is a new authority granted the Federal Reserve post-\nfinancial crisis . Based on the framework approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2016 , the \nCCyB is designed to be implemented while economic growth is healthy, bank profitability  is \nrising and financial stability risks  are “contained , but above normal .”  \n  Based on t he Federal Reserve Board’s assessment, the CCyB has not bee n deployed and \nremains at zero, c oncluding that financial risk is not meaningfully above normal.   \n A second tool, stress testing , has been considered.  The supervisory stress  tests have been \nviewed as a more  dynamic method for evaluating capital against vulnerabilities.  Stress tests are \nforward looking , and by choosing adverse scenarios carefully, the tests can b e used to measure \nexposure to specific risks , such as those  associated with real estate or  rapidly  growing corporate \nleverage.  While the stress testing exercise has been a  useful tool to gauge bank capitalization and \npromote safety and soundness, the underlying assumptions are subject to certain limitations.   All \nmodel results have some degree of uncertainty, especially when the current vulnerabilities , such \nas in leveraged corporate debt,  represent uncharted territory . Stress test results need to be \ninterpreted carefully and used among other indicators of resiliency.   \n                                                 \n1 Tobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macro -prudential Policy: A Case Study \nfrom a Tabletop Exercise,” FRBN Y Economic Policy Review, February 2017.  \n\n \n6 \n Some have argued that stress tests are counter -cyclical in that more stringent scenarios \ncreated during good times encourage (even require) banks to build capital during periods of \neconom ic growth, thereby preparing for future downturns.  I find little evidence that stress tests \nhave done this.  The latest results of the Federal Reserve stress tests that were released last month \nconcluded all have sufficient capital and all were permitted to  proceed  with capital distribution \nand stock b uybac ks. Despite continued economic growth, actual capital ratios on a consolidated \nbasis for the largest banking organizations have not increased in recent years.2 Instead , \nSupplementary Leverage Ratio s (SLRs) have declined in recent years. In addition, recent  \nresearch has shown that the stress tests have not required banks to build capital.3 After \ndistributions and stock buybacks, the losses (declines in capital) in stress scenarios have been \nsmaller over the last few years.  Banks only need to add capital (or reduce capital distributions) \nwhen losses push projected capital ratios below req uired minimums.

First, let me thank the organizers : the Finnish Government, Governor \nRehn and his staff at the Bank of Finland, and the Global Coalition on Aging for inviting me to \nparticipate in this very important forum on the Silver Economy. It is an honor to join with these \nexperts who bring insight to both the challenges and opportunities we are going to face  with an \naging population.   \nCertainly, d emographic trends are reshaping the U.S. labor force , and it is leading \neconomists and policym akers to rethink the key macroeconomic parameters  that drive our \ndecision making .  Monetary policymakers, like myself , have  had to reassess their views about \nthe economy’s longer -run growth potential, the natural rate of unemployment, and how we think \nabou t interest rates .   \n Like melting glaciers, the changes in global demographic trends are often difficult to see \nin the near term, but over time they will reshape the landscape.  Looking over the past quarter \ncentury at the U.S. economy, structural changes have only gradually  reduced the economy’s \npotential growth rate, its natural rate of interest, and  unemployment , but they must be considered \nin the context of how we respond to business cycle fluctuations and potentially underlying \ninflation.  \n I’d like to make three brief  observations about these demographic trends affecting  the \nlabor force ’s composition , the job market , and the housing market.  Then I will briefly describe \nsome of the challenges monetary  policymakers face as they confront these trends . \n \nLong-Term Trends in the Composition of the U.S. Labor Force  \nFirst, the age of the labor force in the United States has changed significantly over the \npast 25 years . The share of older individuals (age 55 and up) in the labor force has continued to \n\n2 \n increase . Twenty -five years ago, o lder individuals made up roughly 10 percent  of the workforce; \ntoday, that share has more than doubled to over 20 percent . At the same time, the shares of \nprime -age (age 25 to 54) and young individuals (age 16 to 24) in the labor for ce have declined. \nThese d emographic factors, particularly the increasing share of the older so -called baby -boom \ngeneration that are retiring, continue to put downward pressure on labor force participation.  \nStarting in the last recession,  we saw that labor  force parti cipation rate s declined steadily.  \nOver the past five years, the participation rate has stabilized as market conditions have improved \nand boosted participation enough to offset some of the downward pull from an aging population.  \nOne of the impo rtant implications of these long -term demographic changes relevant for \npolicymakers is related to  what is known as  the trend unemployment rate. The unemployment \nrate tells you something about the health of the labor market today, but where it stands in rel ation \nto what we think of as a natural  rate – or a trend unemployment rate – is far more informative for \npolicymakers. Research by my own staff at the Kansas City Fed show s that the changes in the \nage and skill composition of the labor force have systematically lowered the trend \nunemployment  rate over the past 25 years .1   \nAs these estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have declined, the scope for \nmonetary p olicy to foster lower rates of unemployment w ithout generating inflationary pressure s \nhas increased. Of course uncertainty about exactly where those natural rates of unemployment \nmight currently lie requires us to be cautious , examine a wide range of information and \ncontinually update the parameters we use as new data arrive.  \n   \n                                                 \n1 Tüzemen, Didem. \"Job polarization and the natural rate of unemployment in the United \nStates.\"  Economics Letters , 175 (2019): 97 -100. \n \n\n3 \n Job P olarization  \nMy second observation is that this shift in the composition of the labor force to older \nwork ers has coincided with  dramatic  changes in skills demanded by employers .  This change, \ndue to technological advancements , has resulted in a phenomenon known  as job polarization. \nMore specifically, job opportunities have shifted away from middle -skill occupations  that lead to \na middle -class standard of living  and toward high - and low -skill occupations . \nSkills demanded in the labor market are rapidly changing, and technological \nadvancement has rendered the skills of many less -educated workers obsolete. As we’ ve \nwitnessed in the U.S. , this lack of job opportunit y, in turn, may lead to depression and illness \namong displaced workers, and these health conditions may become further barriers to their \nemployment. E quipping workers with the new skills employers are demanding in the face of \nrapid technological advancement s continues to be a key issue for labor force  participation and  \npolicy makers .  \n \nDemographic Forces and the Housing Outlook  \n Finally,  my third observation relates to how  these demographic forces are interacting \nwith, and influencing the outlook for, key sec tors of the U.S. economy.  In the housing sector, for \nexample, a combination of forces has  resulted in high levels of housing prices and rents . These \nhigh prices  disproportionately impact younger adults , and as a  consequence younger adults are \ndelaying for ming their own households. For example, the share of adults in their late twenties \nthrough late thirties living with their parents has increased steadily.  This delayed household \nformation is also likely contributing to young a dults delaying marriage  and h aving children.  \n\n4 \n Looking forward,  downsizing by baby boomers could  significantly increase demand for \nnew multifamily construction, especially in metropolitan suburbs. This downsizing , together \nwith the mor tality associated with age , would be expected to free up existing single -family \nhomes for re -occupancy. Younger households who move into these homes from rental units  will \nin turn free up multifamily units for newly forming households.  \n With housing being a key fulcrum of monetary policy and a sector we kno w can be prone \nto boom and bust cycles, these developments will require careful monitoring.   \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy  \n This brings me to the implications of demographic change and other key structural \neconomic relationships for monetary policy.  We have already seen this play out at the Federal \nOpen Market Committee in terms of revisiting our estimates of economic  parameters. For \nexample, according to the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections,  popularly \nreferred to as the “dot plot,”  the median projection for the long -run growth rate of real GDP has \ncome down, t he median projection for the long -run unemployment rate has also fallen \ndramatically a nd the median projection for the long -run interest rates has come down notably .    \n Understa nding of cours e that considerable uncertainty remains around these estimates,  \npolicymakers must remain attuned to changes in macroeconomic trends such as aging \ndemographics if we are to achieve our object ives for the economy."

I’m delighted to be here.  \nMy remarks today will focus on a question that garners  a great deal of attention  for those  \nwho follow Fed policy .  It is a question about whether the current level of inflation is too low. Of \ncourse, understanding the drivers of inflation dynamics is an essential part of the Federal Open \nMarket Committee’s (FOMC)  work.   \n  As central banks have done in other countries, t he Federal Reserve announced last \nNovember its plans to review its monetary policy strategy, tools  and communications practices.   \nThis review strikes me as appropriate given the changes that occur over time in  our economy,  but \nit may be especially important now  in a low interest rate environment . I look forward to the ideas \nthat may come forward as part of  this review , even as I offer  a few preliminary thoughts of my \nown today on the F ederal Reserve’s price sta bility mandate, and the FOMC’s inflation objective \nand policy strategies.   Before I do that, I’ll begin with my views on the economic outlook for the \nnation and monetary policy settings.  \n \nEconomic Outlook  \n Last year, the U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth boosted by accommodative monetary \nand fiscal policies.  As the stimulus from these policies wanes, and with slower foreign  growth, I \nexpect to see a slower pace of growth – somewhere in the neighborhood of the economy’s \nlonger -run trend of roughly 2 percen t.  \n As you know, real gross domestic product (GDP) – our broadest, if not the timeliest, \nmeasure of economic activity  – came in at a stronger -than-expected annual growth rate of 3.2 \npercent in the first quarter.  However, beneath this robust  headline numb er, real final sales to \ndomestic purchasers grew at a more modest 1.3 percent rate  – a clear slowing from its pace in \n\n \n2 \n recent years.  In contrast, inventory investment and net exports contributed a combined 1.7 \npercentage points to overall growth.  Inventories and net exports are volatile and difficult to \npredict.  Based on this underlying data, I would expect to see less contribution from these sectors \nin coming quarter s and a greater contribution from domestic final sales.  \n My outlook for  continued  but somewhat more moderate growth is tied to expectations \nthat job gains, wage increases and  consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer \nspending .  Total nonfarm payroll employment  increased by 263,000 in April after increasing \n189,000 in March.  Over the last three months, j ob gains have averaged 169,000 per month , well \nabove the esti mated  number required to keep the unemployment rate steady.  As a result, we \nhave seen a further decline in the unemployment rate to 3.6 percent in April, the lowest rate since \nDecember 1969.   \n As the job market has tightened , labor compensation has steadily accelerated .  Average \nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual growth rate of roughly 2½ percent in 2017 to 3 \npercent last year, and 3 .3 percent in the first quarter of this year.   With low rates of inflation, \nworkers are beginning to se e signi ficant gains in real wages .  Although consumer confidence was \nbuffeted  early in the year  by the government shutdown  and financial market volatility , it bounced \nback in the spring and remains near its post -recession high.  I am also encouraged to see a  \nrelatively high personal saving rate ( 6.5 percent in March 2019 ), which suggests consumers have \nthe wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse shock.  \nAnother reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that \nbusiness spending has picked up following  the sharp slowdown in 2015 -16.  While I don’t expect \nto see the same robust growth of business fixed investment that we saw last year, I do expect to \nsee it make a positive contribution to overall growth.  The waning of the fiscal stimulus, higher \n\n \n3 \n interest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity.  Still, business \noptimism remains high, and the ou tlook for sales and profits over the medium term remains \nsolid.  \nAs always, there are risks to the outlook , and this generally positive outlook  has several  \nprominent downside risks .  Over the medium term, I see the biggest risk s coming from trade \npolicy un certainty and slower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and the United \nKingdom.    To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary stimulus \nrepresent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we c ould see \nsomewhat slower growth.  Right now the data are noisy , and we need more time and evidence to \njudge whether this risk materializes .   \nFinally , the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign  and, in my view, broadly \nconsistent with our price  stability mandate . While inflation has declined over the course of this \nyear, last year at this time it was near 2 percent.  On a month -to-month basis, movements in \ninflation are  typically  dominated by transitory factors such as changes in energy and import \nprices.  More fundamentally, to the extent beneficial supply side developments such as increased \nproductivity growth may be pushing inflation down, they promote higher real wages and , \nultimately, higher  standards of living.  \n \nOutlook for Monetary Policy  \n At its April meeting the FOMC  maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at \n2¼ to 2½ percent and indicated that it could be patient as it determines whether future \nadjustments  to the target range may be appropriate.  I supported that decision.  This wait -and-see \n\n \n4 \n approach is appropriate because we have not seen upward pressures building on inflation, even \nthough we have experienced above trend growth and a further tightening of labor markets.    \nOver the course of this year , I will be looking for evidence on the amount of slack, if any, \nthat remains in labor  markets; signs that businesses are changing their pricing behavior ; and \nevidence that longer -run inflation expectations could be signaling a lack of confidence in the \nFed’s ability to achieve its longer -run inflation objective  of 2 percent.  I’ll also  be evaluating the \nstance of policy relative to the estimates of the long -run neutral policy rate  – the interest rate \nconsistent with price stability and maximum employment.  This rate has apparently declined over \nthe past decade, but its precise level is uncertain and subject to change.  \n \nThe Balanced Approach  \n Fostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of  course the core of \nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress.  Wit h the unemployment rate at  an historic \nlow level and inflation currently running under the FOMC’s  objective, a  longer -run policy issue \nis whether the persistent undershoot of the inflation objective is undermining its credibility and \ncausing inflation to be anchor ed at too low a level.  Some have expressed concern that i f inflation \nexpectations fall persistently  below the 2 percent  objective , that the extent we could lower real \ninterest rate s by reducing our target for the federal funds rate  – the Fed’s key policy tool  – would \nbe diminished . This could limit the accommodation we could provide in a future downturn \nbecause interest rates cannot fall below a lower bound of roughly zer o percent.       \nAt the time the FOMC  adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012 , monetary policy \nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and  inflation was \nrunning above 2 percent.   Since then, inflation has run pe rsistently below 2 percent.   I have not \n\n \n5 \n viewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy \nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable. Since 2012, core PCE inflation has \nfluctuated in a range of r oughly 1½ to 2 percent , except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed  \ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent .   \nAs long as inflation was below its objective and unemployment was above its longer -run \nlevel, it was appropriate to run an accommodative  policy to promote the movement of both \nvariables back toward their longer -run sustainable levels.  Accommodative policies tend to lower \nunemployment and, generally  speaking , increase inflation.  \nBut with the unemployment rate now below its longer -run level, s hould we still be \nconcerned about inflation  running slightly below target ?  As I listen to business and community \nleaders around my region, I hear few complaints about inflation being too low.  In fact, I am \nmore likely to hear disbelief when I mention tha t inflation is as low as measured in a number of \nkey sectors.   \nThis leads me to the observation that inflation as experienced by households and \nbusinesses is fundamentally different from inflation as viewed by financial market participants \nand many econom ists.  Households see the prices  of everyday goods such as food, energy, rents, \nand health care rising and don’t understand why the Fed would be concerned that inflation is too \nlow. Their short -run expectations for inflation are driven largely by changes i n retail gasoline \nprices while their longer -run expectations, as measured by the University of Michigan, have been \nfairly stable . (Expected changes in prices during the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 \nand 2.6 percent since January 2018  and are cur rently at 2.3 percent. ) \nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power, \nsee their profit margins squeezed.  For them, the product prices they charge are determined by \n\n \n6 \n structural factors such as global competition an d technological disruption that don’t  necessarily  \nrespond to monetary policy , while their costs are driven by tight labor and commodity  market \nconditions . In the April  survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business,  only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most \nimportant problem, compared with 24 percent who said “quality of labor” and 8 percent who said \n“cost of labor.”  \nIn contrast, financial market participants see inflation and inflation expec tations as key \ndriver s of monetary policy decisions. They look at past, current, and expected future inflation \nrelative to target to form a view about the policy path that they then use to price financial market \ninstruments.  If they perceive the 2 percent  inflation objective as a line in the sand that the Fed \ndoes not want to overshoot , they may come to expect inflation to run belo w 2 percent over the \nlonger run. This concern has led to calls for the Fed to ease rates to push inflation and inflation \nexpect ations higher in an effort to  maintain the credibility  of the target  and preserve policy space.  \nBut even if such a policy  were  effective, how is policy space preserved if rates have to be cut to \nboost  longer -run inflation expectations?   \nEven with these concerns , I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longer -\nrun objective for inflation  in 2012 , and I support it today .  I believe it has been effective in \nhelping anchor longer -run inflation expectations.  Arguably, though, adopting a point est imate \ninstead of a range has placed considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the \nprecision with which monetary policy can a chieve this goal .1  It would seem reasonable that even \n                                                 \n1 Jon Faust and Eric Leeper  describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to \nexplain movements in inflation with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates” \nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary polic y,” in “ The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of \nInflation and Monetary Policy ,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, \nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015, \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en . \n \n\n \n7 \n somewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if th ey are limited to, say 50 basis points \nabove or below , may be acceptable  taken in the context of  broader economic conditions.  \nThe FOMC anticipated that its objectives for employment and inflation cou ld move in \ndifferent directions . It addresses this issue  in its annual  “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and \nMonetary Policy Strategy,” noting that when its objectives are not complementary, the \nCommittee follow s a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of \nthe deviations and the pot entially different time horizons over which employment and inflation \nare projected to return to mandate -consistent levels.   \nWhat this means is that we should not focus on one leg of the mandate without \nconsideration for the other.  For example, cutting in terest rates today to boost inflation to 2 \npercent at some point in the future would likely cause labor markets to tighten further, leading to \na reallocation of resources into the most interest sensitive sectors.  Given the current \nunresponsiveness of infl ation to labor market tightness , it might take a considerable further \neasing of policy and considerable further  tightening of labor market conditions to have the \ndesired impact on inflation.   And given the lags with which monetary policy operates, it may \ntake a considerable period of time.  In the meantime, lower interest rates  might fuel asset price \nbubbles , create financial imbalances, and ultimately a recession.  \nIn current circumstances, with an unemployment rate well below its projected longer -run \nlevel, I see little reason to be concerned about inflation running a bit below its longer -run \nobjective.  Moreover, I am not convinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below objective \nrequir es an offsetting overshoot of the objective.   As I mentioned earlier, the current benign \ninflation outlook gives us the opportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the \neconomy and the level of the n eutral  rate of interest.  \n\n \n8 \n Conclusions  \nWith the current outlook for the economy remaining positive, monetary policy settings \nlook appropriate to me.  As we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary \npolicy “space” could be limited in response to a future downturn because o f the low level of \ninterest rates.2 This has led some to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some \nkind of a price -level target.  While I see little value in pursuing a higher inflation target given the \ncredibility we have built over the last decade around 2 percent, the Federal Reserve will be \nseeking ideas and input on alternative policy strategies next month at a conference hosted by the \nChicago Fed.3  It will be an opportunity to learn  more about the pros and cons of different \napproach es for our monetary  policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.   \nThe current level of inflation may perplex central bankers and financial market \nparticipants, but in the context of a growing economy and job gains, it doesn’t demand a Fed \npolicy response  in my view.   Steering what is currently a low and stable rate of inflation up by \n20-50 basis points to reach a precise numerical target , while  disregarding the labor market, the \nother leg of our dual mandate, strikes me as a degree of fine -tuning  that goes beyond our span of \ncontrol .  \n \n                                                 \n2Other government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might cont ribute to faster \ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby providing additional monetary policy space.  Moreover, \nthe prospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need \nto be on the menu of possible counter -cyclical options.  \n3 Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession, \nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hit ting the zero lower bound \n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at the ZLB in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit: \nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future , Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas  City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en ."

With 17 participants currently sitting on the  Federal \nOpen Market Committee  (FOMC ), the public has access to a variety of perspectives and insights \non the U.S. economy and monetary policy.

See also, Richard Clarida, “The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, \nand Communication Practices, https: //www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20190222a.htm . \n \n\n \n \n2 \n Economic Outlook  \n I’ll begin with a brief review of the economic outlook . Last year, the U.S. economy \nenjoyed robust growth boosted  by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.  As the stimulus \nfrom these policies wanes, and global growth slows, I expect a deceleration this year toward the \neconomy’s longer -run growth trend of roughly 2 percent.   \n My outlook for  continued, but somewhat more moderate growth, is tied to expectations \nthat job gains, wage increases and consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer \nspending . Although the monthly increase in payroll employment fell to just 20,000  last month , \nthe previous two months were revised up and, averaging over the last three months, employment \nincreased by a strong  186,000 jobs  per month . Weaker aspects of the February jobs report \nsuggest the  unusually harsh winter weather negatively impact ed constructio n employment and \nspending on entertainment . While I would expect to see a rebound in March , employment growth \nwill likely slow to a rate more consistent with the net rate of entry into the labor force . \nAs the job market has tightened , labor compensation has steadily accelerated . Average \nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual rate of roughly 2½ percent last February t o almost \n3½ percent this February.  And w ith low rates of inflation, workers are beginning to se e \nsignificant real i ncome gains.  Real personal disposable income increased almost 4 percent last \nyear on a twelve -month basis.  Although consumer confidence has been buffeted by the \ngovernment shutdown, financial market volatility, and a softening of employment growth in \nFebru ary, consumers continue to expect the economy to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace \nthan last year.  Moreover, given the relatively high personal saving rate (7.6 percent in December \n2018), consumers have the wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse \nshock.  \n\n \n \n3 \n Another reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that \nbusinesses have increased capital spending after the sharp slowdown in 2015 -16. While I don’t \nexpect to see the same robust growth of busines s fixed investment that we saw last year, I do \nexpect to see it make a positive contribution to overall growth.  The waning of the fiscal stimulus, \nhigher interest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity.  Still, \nbusiness  optimism remains high, and the outlook for sales and profits over the medium term \nremains solid.  \nAs always, there are risks to the outlook , and this generally positive outlook  has several  \nprominent downside risks . Tracking measures of first quarter growt h appear to be weak, but \ncould well reflect the influence of  transitory factors such as the government shutdown, financial \nvolatility, an unusually harsh winter , and heightened p olicy uncertainty.  Over the medium term, I \nsee the biggest risk coming from sl ower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and \nthe United Kingdom . To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary \nstimulus represent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we could \nsee somewhat slower growth.  Right now the data are noisy , and we need more time and evidence \nto separate the signal from the noise .  \nFinally , the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign , and I consider the recent \nbehavior of inflation to be broadly consistent with our price stability mandate.   \n \nOutlook for monetary policy  \nWith the solid expansion experienced over the past few years and a generally positive \noutlook over the medium term , the Federal Reserve has been in a position to remove much of the \npolicy accommodation that was put in place during the  financial crisis and Great Recession.  In \n\n \n \n4 \n addition  to raising short -term rates 225 basis points , the Fed’s balance sheet has been slowly \nshrink ing as securities have matured.  At its meeting last week, th e FOMC noted it would \nconclude the reduction of its securities holdings by the end of September.3 With high levels of \nemployment and low inflation readings, the FOMC has judged it can be patient in determining \nwhether it needs to take any further policy ac tions.  I supported that decision.  \n \nEvaluating our inflation objective  \n Fostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of course the core of \nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress.  With the unemployment rate at  a historic ally \nlow level and inflation currently running just under the FOMC’s  objective, a  longer -run policy \nissue is whether the persistent undershoot of our inflation objective is undermining its credibility \nand causing inflation to be anchor ed at too low a level.  If inflation expectations fall persistently  \nbelow 2 percent , the extent we could lower real interest rate s by reducing our nominal target for \nthe funds rate would be diminished . This could limit the accommodation we could provide if we \nwere to return to th e zero lower bound.   \nAt the time the FOMC  adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012 , monetary policy \nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and  inflation was \nrunning above 2 percent.  Since then, inflation has run  persistently below 2 percent.  I have not \nviewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy \nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable.  Since 2012, core PCE inflation has \nfluctuated in a range of  roughly 1½ to 2 percent , except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed  \ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent  \n                                                 \n3 For information about the Committee’s plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer -\nrun operating regime, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy -normalization.htm . \n\n \n \n5 \n Should we be concerned about this low level of inflation?  As I listen to business and \ncommunity leaders around my region, I hear few complaint s about inflation being too low.  In \nfact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that inflation is as low as measured in a \nnumber of key sectors.  I see this reaction to inflation as a good sign, and consider this \nperformance consistent with the definition of price stability that Paul Volcker and Alan \nGreenspan preferred . Both of them  judged price s tability as an inflation rate that is sufficiently \nlow [and stable] that it is not considered a key factor in the decisions of businesses or \nhouseholds .  \nEven so , I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longer -run objective for \ninflation  in 2012 , and I support it today . I believe it has been effective in helping anchor longer -\nrun inflation expectations.  Arguably, though, adopting a point estimate instead of a range has \nplaced considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the precision with which \nmonetary policy can achieve this particular numerical target.4 It would seem reasonable that even \nsomewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if they are limited to, say 50 basis points \nabove or below the objective may be acceptable, depending on broader economic conditions.  \nI also support the idea that the objective should be symmetric so that deviations below \nand above the objective should be viewed as costly, taking into account deviations of \nemployment from our employment objective. Consistent with  the FOMC’s  “Statement on \nLonger -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” this suggests th at when our objectives are not \ncomple mentary, we follow a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the \n                                                 \n4 Jon Faust and Eric Leeper describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to \nexplain movements in inflati on with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates” \nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary policy,” in “ The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of \nInflation and Monetary Policy ,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, \nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015, \nhttps://www.kansa scityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en . \n \n\n \n \n6 \n magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment \nand inflation are projected to return to mandate -consistent levels.  In current c ircumstances, with \nan unemployment rate well below its projected longer -run level, I see little reason to be \nconcerned about inflation running a bit below its longer -run objective.  Moreover, I am not \nconvinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below ob jective requires an offsetting overshoot \nof the objective.  As I mentioned earlier, the current benign inflation outlook gives us the \nopportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the economy and the level of the \nnatural rate of interest.  \nAs we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary policy “space” \ncould  be limited in the next downturn because of the low level of interest rates.5 This has led \nsome to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some kind of a price -level target.  \nWhile I see little value in pursuing  a higher inflation target given the credibility we have built \nover the last decade around 2 percent, evaluating alternative policy strategies is appropriate .6 \nSome have promoted the use of  a tem porary price -level target that takes effect when the federal \nfunds rate target hits the zero bound.  Another approach might be an inflation target that is \nachieved on average over a fixed period of time or over the business cycle.  In theory, a price -\n                                                 \n5Other government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might contribute to faster \ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby p roviding additional monetary policy space.  Moreover, the \nprospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need to \nbe on the menu of possible counter -cyclical options.   \n6 Former Federal Reserve C hair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession, \nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hitting the zero lower bound \n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at th e ZLB  in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit: \nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future , Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en . At the same symposium, \nMarvin Goodfriend discussed the use of negative nominal interest rates in “Th e Case for Unencumbering Interest \nRate Policy at the Zero Bound.”  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016goodfriend.pdf? la=en . \n  \n\n \n \n7 \n level t arget that is fully credible could potential ly smooth fluctuations in output and employment, \nespecially at the zero lower bound.  \nWhile not pre -judging the potential efficacy of such strategies, I see both fundamental \nand practical issues to grapple with in moving to s uch regime s. What works in elegant economic \nmodels can have limitations and unintended consequences when put into practice.  \nFundamentally, an effective price -level target could substantially reduce uncertaint y about the \nprice level many years into the future and thereby help households and businesses make long -\nterm plans and commitments.  It also  could increase the variability  of, and uncertainty about,  \ninflation over the medium term.  This is because a price -level target would require policymakers \nto engineer an increase in inflation in response to the price level falling below its target path and \nengineer a decrease in inflation in response to the price level rising above the target path.  These \nbenefits and cos ts would need to be carefully weighed.  \nOn a more practical level, there are a number of issues to be consider ed. First, in a price -\nlevel targeting regime, choosing  the base period can make a big difference.  For example, getting \nback to a 2 percent price -level path that was based in a year just prior to the Great Recession \nwould require a much longer period of above 2 -percent inflation  than if the base year were set \nmore recently.  This is simpl y because the cumulative undershoot of the 2 -percent price path \nwould be so much greater under  the earlier base period.  \nSecond, g iven the difficulty over the last decade in getting inflation up to 2 percent on a \nsustained basis, it is not clear to me that adopting a price -level target would be any more \neffective than our current inflation target.  And deliberately push ing inflation above 2 percent at a \ntime when  the unemployment rate is well below its presumed longer -run level  could be costly.  It \n\n \n \n8 \n would likely require a further overheating of the labor market with related misallocation of \nresources, along with increased uncertainty about the future inflation rate and price level.  \nThird, a price -level target ing strategy  is time inconsisten t unles s policymakers can \ncredibly commit to following it . If the goal is to have inflation of 2 percent on average, a period \nof below 2 percent inflation would require an equal period of inflation above 2 percent . But once \ninflation has moved up to 2 percent , policymakers might be tempted to renege on their prior \ncommitment and not allow inflation to go higher.  This would undermine the future credibility of \nthe price -level targeting strategy.  To the extent the public understood this time inconsistency \nproblem, pr ice-level targeting would not be credible to begin with, absent a commitment device.  \nWith regular turnover among members of the FOMC, it would be difficult for one Committee to \ncommit a future Committee to a particular course of action.  \nFourth, t he timefra me for achieving an average inflation target  would be difficult to \ndetermine  and communicate . “Over the business cycle” is a vague timeframe since business \ncycles vary in length  and recessions are notoriously difficult to predict . Given that U.S. inflation  \nhas been below target for seven  years, would we need  or want  seven -plus years of inflation \nabove 2 percent?  At what point should bygones be  bygones?  \nFinally, t he Federal Reserve’s most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress contained \na section on policy rules and systematic monetary policy.  It provided an example of a  price -level \ntargeting  rule that included the gap between the level of prices today and the level of prices that \nwould be observed if inflation had been a constant at 2 percent from a specified starting year  \n(1998) . The prescription from that rule would have been  to set the target funds rate at less than 1 \npercent at the end of last year. Of course, it is impossible to judge the counterfactual implications \nof maintaining the funds rate target at or below 1 percent throughout the recovery.  I think it is \n\n \n \n9 \n fair to assume , however, that the potential to generate real and financial imbalances  might be \nsubstantial , ultimately imposing a n even  higher cost to the economy than where we are today.  \n \nConclusions  \nThe econom y’s fundamentals are sound.  Downside risks are notable however as my \noutlook calls for growth to slow to trend, with moderating job gains and low inflation.  In these \ncircumstances, m onetary policy can take a wait -and-see approach.   \nOver the longer -run, with an evolving economy, prudent policymaking would suggest  \ntaking a look at our current policy strategies to see if they can be improved  or refined, especially \nin light of the possibility of a future return to the zero lower bound.  In doing so,  we must be \naware that what works in theory may have limitations and unintended consequences when \nadopted in practice.  The Federal Reserve will explore these issues as part of its review of its \nmonetary policy strategy, tools  and communications p ractices  this year."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 15, 2019  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed  by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n I’m delighted  to be back  with the Central  Exchange  for what  has become  something  of a \nNew  Year’s  tradition.   This year marks  another  rotation  for me into the role of a voting  member  \non the Federal  Reserve’s  Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC) —the body  that sets our nation’s  \nmonetary  policy.    \nAs you may know,  the FOMC  consists  of the governors  of the Federal  Reserve  Board , \nwho are nominated  by the president  and confirmed  by the Senate , and the presidents  of the 12 \nregional  Federal  Reserve  Banks , who are appointed  by their respective  Boards  of Directors  \nsubject  to the approval  of the Board  of Governors  in Washington.   Each  of the governors  and the \nregional  Fed presidents  participate  in all FOMC  meetings .  However , voting  rights  are rotated  \namong  the presidents  each year.  In contrast  to the governors  and the New  York  Fed president , \nwho each have  a permanent  vote on the FOMC,  the other  11 Fed presidents  share  four votes  on a \nrotating  basis.   This system  was designed  to ensure  that the publicly  appointed  governors  have  a \nmajority  of votes  on the Committee  unless  there  are vacancies  on the Board  of Governors.   As \npresident  of the Kansas  City Fed, I rotate  voting with the presidents  of the Minneapolis  and San \nFrancisco  Feds.    \nWith  that in mind,  my remarks  today  will focus  on the current  state of the economy  and, \nin that context,  how I’m thinking  about  the stance  of monetary  policy .   \nThe U.S. economy  is currently  enjoy ing one of its longest  expansions,  while  the Federal  \nReserve  has been  gradually  removing  a portion  of the massive  accommodation  it provided  \nbeginning  in 2008.   Short -term interest  rates  have  moved  up and the Fed’s  sizeable  balance  \nsheet , which  reached  $4.5 trillion  in late 2014,  has been  slowly  shrinking.   With  these  conditions  \nin play,  the question s currently  being  asked  are, “Where are we in the normalization  process?   \nDo we have  some  distance  to go to reach  a ‘norma l’ interest  rate or are we nearly  there ?”  \n\n \n2 \n These  questions  remind  me of road trips with my children .  Filled  with anticipation  to \nreach  the destination,  they would  ask, repeatedly,  “Are we there  yet, how much  longer ?” The \nanswer  was usually  a vague  response,  like “We’re getting  close .  Just look out the window.”      \nToday,  even  with GPS-like technology  to serve  as a guide , I find our policy  map is \nincomplete  and, therefore,  I cannot  give an exact  answer  to how close  we are to a neutral  setting  \nfor interest  rates.   There  remain s a host of factors  that can influence  its “location ,” and, as a \nconsequence , will affect  the journey  ahead .  The truth  is that a vague  “we’re  getting  close ” may \nbe the best response  I have  to offer .   \nLet me share  my thoughts  on where  we are and why this is the case, reminding  you that \nthe views I express  today  are my own.  \n \nA Look  at the U.S. Economy  and Where  We Are \n By most  measures,  the U.S. economy  is performing  well.   The unemployment  rate is near \na 50-year low, and inflatio n is stable  and well-anchored  near the Federal  Reserve’s  2 percent  \ntarget.   In addition,  real gross  domestic  product  (GDP )—our broadest  measure  of economic  \nactivity —is increasing  at a moderate  pace,  supported  by both consumer  spending  and business  \nfixed  investment.   Last year,  with accommodative  fiscal  and monetary  policies,  real GDP  grew  at \nan estimated  annual  rate of roughly  3 percent —somewhat  above  the economy’s  longer -run \ngrowth  potential,  which  is estimated  to be a bit below  2 percent.    \nLooking  ahead,  I would  expect  to see a somewhat  slower  rate of growth,  closer  to but \nperhaps  still a bit above,  the economy’s  longer -run growth  potential.   While  we have  begun  to \nsee some  slowing  in interest -sensitive  sectors  such as housing  and motor  vehicles,  consider able \nunderlying  momentum  remains  and should  serve  to sustain  the expansion.   For example,  \n\n \n3 \n business  and consumer  confidence  are both near post-recession  highs.   Wages  are rising  at a \nroughly  3 percent  annual  rate, up from  2½ percent  a year ago.  Manufacturi ng activity  has \nrecovered  from  a slowdown  in 2015 -16 and is now expanding  at a solid  pace.  And,  employment  \ncontinues  to grow  at a rate that is faster  than required  to absorb  new entrants  into the job market.  \nAlongside  these  favorable  outcomes,  there  are of course  factors  that will affect  this \nperformance  and pose risks  to the outlook.   On the upside,  growth  above  the economy’s  longer -\nrun potential  could  further  stretch  labor  markets,  leading  to wage  gains  that are out of line with \nproductivity  growth.  As these  wage  gains  begin  to shrink  profit  margins,  firms  may pass higher  \nlabor  costs  on to their customers  causing  inflation  to rise.  According  to standard  economic  \ntheory,  there  is a level  of unemployment —calle d the natural  rate of unemployment —at which  \ninflation  neither  rises nor falls.   When  the unemployment  rate falls below  the natural  rate, \ninflation  tends  to rise.  There  is a lot of uncertainty  about  where  the natural  rate is, but current  \nestimates  place  it around  4½ percent.   Thus,  with the unemployment  rate at 3.9 percent  in \nDecember  and expected  to fall further,  it is possible  that we could  be on the cusp of an \nundesirable  increase  in inflation.    \nOn the downside,  financial  market  conditions  have  tightened  and become  more  volatile.   \nThe foreign  exchange  value  of the dollar  has appreciated,  contributing  to a loss of \ncompetitiveness  of our exports  and potentially  a softening  of inflation  below  our 2 percent  \nobjective.   Credit  spreads  have  widened,  making  capital  investment  costlier.   Uncertainty  about  \ntrade  policy  and global  economic  growth  has increased,  possibly  causing  businesses  to postpone  \nor rethink  capital  spending  projects.   In my travels  aroun d the seven  states  of the Tenth Federal  \nReserve  District,  I increasingly  hear that input  costs  are rising,  qualified  workers  are hard to find \n\n \n4 \n and retain,  pricing  power  is limited,  and that firms  are pulling  back  rather  than passing  higher  \ncosts  on to their customers.    \nTwo sectors  of particular  importance  to our region  have  their own unique  set of \nchallenges.  The farm  sector  is in a prolonged  downturn  as a result  of declining  agricultural  \nprices,  made  worse  by retaliatory  tariffs  on U.S. farm  products.   And the oil and gas sector  is \nfacing  another  sharp  decline  in oil prices.   While  this sector  has expanded  dramatically  since  the \nearly  2000s  thanks  to fracking  and the related  shale  oil revolution,  sharp  oil price  fluctuations  \nhave  led to a boom -and-bust cycle that may be repeating  itself.     \n To summarize,  labor  markets  are tight,  inflation  is low and stable,  and economic  growth  \nis expected  to slow  to a rate close  to the economy’s  longer -run growth  potential.   \nNotwithstanding  both upside  and downside  risks,  the outlook  for the economy  appears  favorable.      \n \nImplications  for monetary  policy  \nWith  this background,  let me turn to the matter  of monetary  policy.   Since  the beginning  \nof the interest  rate normalization  process  in December  2015,  the Federal  Reserve  has raised  rates  \n225 basis  points,  removing  much  of the policy  accommodation  that was put in place  during  the \nfinancial  crisis  and Great  Recession.   \nSo, are we there  yet?  Has the FOMC  raised  rates  back  to a neutral  or normal  level  so that \nthey are no longer  either  stimulating  or restraining  economic  activity?   Have  we reached  the \nproverbial  soft landing  where  the economy  has achieved  maximum  employment,  stable  prices,  \ngrowth  at potential,  and monetary  policy  neutrality?  In my view,  we are not there  just yet.  \nHowever,  we are close  and for now,  it seems  to me that we should  proceed  with cautio n and be \npatient  as we approach  our destination.  \n\n \n5 \n   As the year unfolds , I will be looking  for signals  from  the economy  in a number  of areas  \nthat will determine  my policy  choices.   My position  on whether  to further  increase  rates  or stay \nwhere  we currently  are will depend  on several  factors.   If, for example,  the inflation  outlook  \nremains  benign  despite  tight labor markets  or if the downside  risks  I spoke  of earlier  materia lize, \nwe can pause  the normalization  process.   On the other  hand , if inflation  pressures  emerge , it \nwould  suggest  we are further  away  from  neutral  than we may have  previously  thought  and \nfurther  interest  rate increases  could  be necessary .   \nIn judging  future economic  conditions , I am mindful  that the effects  of past policy  actions  \nhave  not yet fully  played  out, calling  for patience  in considering  our policy  actions .  As the \nfamous  economist  Milton  Friedman  observed,  monetary  policy  acts with “long  and varia ble \nlags.”   Typically,  policy  moves  affect  real economic  activity  with a lag of six months  to a year \nand inflation  in one to two years.   Given  the cumulative  225 basis  points  of tightening —100 \nbasis  points  of which  occurred  last year—we have  likely  not yet seen the full effect  of higher  \nrates  on real economic  activity  or inflation.   A pause  in the normalization  process  would  give us \ntime to assess  if the economy  is responding  as expected  with a slowing  of growth  to a pace that \nis sustainable  over the longer  run.  Failure  to recognize  these  lags could  lead to an over-\ntightening  of policy,  a downturn  in economic  growth  and an undershooting  of our inflation  \nobjective.  \nThese  issues  are made  all the more  difficult  by a fact that I mentioned  earlier  in my \nremarks —the map guiding  us is incomplete.   We do not know  precisely  the location  of our \ndestination:  that is, the longer -run neutral  value  of the federal  funds  rate.  Recall  that the neutral  \nrate is the rate that neither  stimulates  economic  activity  nor restrains  it.  Participants  at last \nmonth’s  FOMC  meeting  gave  a range  of estimates  of the longer -run federal  funds  rate from  2½ \n\n \n6 \n percent  to 3½ percent  with a median  of 2.8 percent.   With  the funds  rate target  currently  at 2¼ to \n2½ percent,  we are near the lower  end of the range  of our estimates  of neutral .  And complicating  \nour reliance  on these  estimates  is that, in the background,  we are gradually  reducing  the size of \nour balance  sheet,  allowing  assets  to roll off as they mature .  It is unclear  whether,  or how much,  \nthis roll off is further  removing  accommodation.  Again,  this sugg ests it might  be a good  time to \npause  our interest  rate normalization , study  the incoming  evidence  and data, and verify  our \ncurrent  location.    \nA final reason  to show  patience  around  further  rate adjustments  is that a number  of key \neconomic  relationships  that have  guided  policy  over the years  may have  broken  down  in the \naftermath  of the financial  crisis  and Great  Recession.   Structural  changes  in the economy  such as \nthe aging  of the populatio n, sluggish  productivity  growth,  business  sector  consolidation,  rising  \ngovernment  deficits  and debt,  and historically  low interest  rates  have  potentially  rendered  past \nguideposts  to policy  less reliable.   In addition,  central  banks  in other  parts  of the world, like the \nFederal  Reserve,  undertook  massive  asset  purchase  programs  to address  the financial  crisis,  and \nare now beginning  to confront  the need  to shrink  their balance  sheets.   These  central  bank  \ninterventions  may be changing  the structure  of financia l markets  in unknown  and unpredictable  \nways.  \nOne relationship,  for example,  that has confounded  economists  and policymakers  over \nthe past several  years  is that of inflation  and economic  slack.   As mentioned  earlier,  when  the \nunemployment  rate falls below  its natural  rate, we generally  expect  inflation  to rise.  But despite  \nunemployment  falling  well below  most  estimates  of the natural  rate, inflation  has remained  \nsubdued.   This raises  questions  about  whether  our estimate  of the natural  rate is too pessimisti c \nand whether  the economy  can operate  at a lower  unemployment  rate today  than in the past \n\n \n7 \n without  sparking  inflationary  pressures.   This is another  area where  I will be looking  for \nfeedback  from  the economy  to assess  whether  we might  need  to revise  our estimates  of the \nnatural  rate. \nTo this mix, I would  add any number  of additional  real and financial  market  indicators  to \nmonitor  closely  for evidence  that monetary  policy  is approaching  neutral  and that the pace of \nnormalization  should  change.   Gauging  the appropriate  policy  response  will also importantly  be \nshaped  by analysis  from  my staff and input  from  a wide  range  of contacts  who have  on-the-\nground  knowledge  of financial  conditions,  price  pressures,  and the outlook  for economic  activity.    \n \nConclusion  \nEarlier in the normalization  process,  the FOMC  provided  forward  guidance  suggesting  \nthat monetary  policy  was accommodative  and that gradual  interest  rate increases  would  be \nconsistent  with achieving  our goals.   Given  current  economic  conditions,  providing  such explicit  \nguidance  now about  the future  path of policy  rates  would  not be appropriate  in my view.   \nBack  then,  policy  was some  distance  from  a neutral  setting  and we had not fully  realized  \nour objectives  for employment  and inflation,  and thus the direction  of policy  was clear.   Today,  \ncircumstances  are different.   While  my policy  view  always  depends  on the flow of data,  this year \nwe must  acknowledge  that rates are approaching,  and may be closing  in on, our destination  of \nneutral.    We should  also remain  sharply aware  that the effects  of past rate increases,  while  \ndissipating,  are still in play and the effects  will need  to be watched  carefully.    \nIt is possible  that some  additional  rate increases  will be appropriate .  But making  that \njudgment  is not urgent  and should  depend  on a careful  look at the data and gathering  additional  \n\n \n8 \n insight  into where  our destination  is, how much  further  we need  to go to reach  it and how \nquickly  we should  get there ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 11, 2018  \nEconomic Forum  \nTulsa, Oklahoma  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Ten years ago this month, financial conditions were fragile and the economy was deep in \nrecession.   The unemployment rate stood at 6.5 percent  on its way to 10 percent a  year later.  \nThe recovery from th at recession was slow, but the economy has come a long way.  The \ncombination of fiscal stimulus, corporate and bank  bailouts , and unconventional monetar y policy \naided in stabiliz ing the economy .  Yet, these dramatic actions did  not generate the sharp bounce \nback of economic activity that we might have expected based on some past recoveries .  Instead, \nthe economy found its footing in a  moderate , but resilient, recovery with annual growth in real \nGross Domestic Product (GDP) of around 2 percent.  More surprisingly, despite  the sluggish \npace of  output  growth , employment has grown at a relatively brisk  pace, pushing the \nunemployment rate down to its lowe st level since 1969 . \nBecause we are well into a recovery of record length, and with interest rates increasing, \nmany pundits are saying a recession is inevitably on the horizon.  Others are convinced  that \nrecent tax cuts and increased government spending , combined with robust consumer and \nbusiness spending , provide momentum that could extend the current expansion .  Rather than try \nto project the future, I’ll discuss what I see as the key factors that are in play today and that, on \nbalance, suggest continued growth ahead.  In doing so, I’ll offer my views on monetary policy \nand highlight the changing role of the energy  sector in contributing to the overall performance of \nthe economy , including the region served by the Kansas City Fed . \n \nU.S. Economic Outlook  \n By nearly every measure, the U.S. economy is performing well.  With accommodative \nfinancial conditions, elevated levels of confidence and solid labor markets, it seems reasonable to \nexpect economic growth slightly above trend with low and stable inflation  for the next few years . \n\n2 \n Consumers are poised to continue to be the main force behind this expansion, and the recent \npickup in business investment may continue as well .   \nDigging  a little deeper into the details, several factors support  the outlook for \nconsumption. Household balance sheets remain strong. The latest data show that the personal \nsavings rate is 6.6  percent  and household net worth as a share of income is at a histor ically high \nlevel. W age growth has  steadily increased, approaching 3 percent in the latest report s, and \nconsumer confidence is at its highest level since prior to 2008 . Finally, job gains continue to rise \nfaster than is needed to absorb workers entering the labor force . \nThe outlook for business spending is also favorable.  Business  investment expanded \nrobustly last year , and the momentum has continued in 2018. During the first half  of this year , \nbusiness investment grew at an average annualized rate of 10  percent . This is a welcome step up \nfrom the stagnant investment levels in 2015 -2016.  \nLooking ahead, capital expenditures seem poised to continue at a robust pace, as \neconomic growth remai ns solid , borrowing costs remain low , and rising labor costs combined \nwith labor shortages lead firms to invest in technology to automate tasks .  The recent cut in the \ncorporate tax rate provides additional incentives  for investment. And, as I will discuss later, \nadvances  in shale oil production have become an important factor in boosting investment .  This \nimpetus from the energy sector seems likely  to continue.  Over the longer -term, however, \ninvestment spending will likely slow to a more sustainable rate in line with the economy’s \npotential growth rate .  \nOther sectors of the economy, including net exports, residential investment, and \ninventories, a re likely to be a more neutral and uncertain influence on the overall economy.  For \nexample, the recent appreciation of the dollar, along with  possible  retaliatory tariffs and slower \n\n3 \n growth in the emerging market economies, could cause net exports be  a modest drag on overall \neconomic growth.  Nevertheless, I expect domestic demand to remain strong.  \nThis strong demand growth will reinforce the outlook for a tight labor market.  The \nunemployment rate currently stands at 3.7 percent, well below most estimate s of its long -run \nsustainable level. With solid employment gains averaging 190,000  jobs per month in the last \nthree months , some observers argue the economy is getting a second wind .  My own \ninterpretation of these gains is that we are seeing the hallmarks o f a mature expansion.   Looking \nthrough monthly fluctuations in the job market report s shows that the pace of payroll growth has \nactually moderated from a few years ago. At its peak in early 2015 , the year -over-year change in \ntotal payrolls was roughly 3 mi llion. In contrast, the latest data point to a year -over-year change \nin total payrolls of 2.5 million. I expect this trend of slowing employment gains to continue as \nlabor market conditions tighten further  and it becomes harder for firms to fill vacancies.  \nDespite tight labor markets and above trend growth, inflation has remained low. In fact, \ninflation has been remarkably stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen sharply.  That \nsaid, the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has prevailed , even as the \nunemployment rate has fallen below estimates of its long -run sustainable level,  could push \ninflation somewhat higher over the next couple of years.  Of course, the outlook for inflation  has \nimplications for monetary policy.  \n \nImplications for Monet ary Policy  \nAt last month’s meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) t ook another step \nto remove some of the extraordinary monetary accommodation that has been in place since the \nonset of the financial crisis.  This gradual normalization of policy seems appropriate to me given \n\n4 \n that the FOMC’s employment and inflation objectives have largely  been achieved while the \ncurrent setting of its overnight interest rate target remains below estimates of its longer -run \nvalue.   \nAs the FOMC seeks to make moneta ry policy a more neutral influence on the economy \nand, thereby, sustain the economic expansion , policymakers must consider a variety of risks and \nuncertainties around the outlook  for the economy .  On the upside, accommodative financial \nconditions, elevated  consumer confidence and expansionary fiscal policy could lead to further \nincreases in economic growth  and inflation . On the downside, trade policy uncertainty, growing \nrisks in emerging market economies and policy divergence between the U.S. and other adv anced \neconomies could slow down both foreign and U.S. growth.   \nWhile I see these risks as currently balanced, the path of policy cannot be on a pre -set \ncourse at this stage of the expansion.  The FOMC’s approach of gradual increases in the target \nfederal funds rate, combined with gradual reductions in the size of the Fed eral Reserve ’s balance \nsheet, has aimed to thread this needle.  This means p olicymakers will need to carefully assess the \neffects past policy actions are likely to have  as they look  for economic fundamentals to remain \nconsistent with the objectives of maximum employment and price stability .   \n \nThe Shale Oil Revolution  \nTo this point, I’ve talked about the cyclical nature of the economy and how monetary \npolicy interacts with those cyclical fea tures .  At the same time, however, a number of structural \nchanges are occurring in the U.S. economy that bear watching.  Among these developments are \nthe aging of the population, ongoing technological change  and weak readings for productivity \n\n5 \n growth.  A ke y industrial change that is particularly relevant in Oklahoma  is related to the shale \noil revolution, and I’d like to spend a few minutes talking about some of its implications.   \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, sharp oil price increases pushed the U.S. economy in to \n“stagflation” — an economic downturn with a simultaneous and persistent increase in inflation.  \nAt the time,  the United States was heavily dependent on oil imports for its energy needs, and \nhigher oil prices acted as a tax on U.S. consumers paid to forei gn oil producers.  Of particular \nnote, t he rise in inflation that resulted from higher oil prices tended to persist. Once inflation \nrose, people expected it to remain elevated, suggesting a lack of confidence in the F OMC  to \nmaintain price stability over th e longer run.     \nToday , the economy’s reaction to a sharp change in oil prices is quite different.  As you \nknow, oil and gas production has boomed in the United States over the past two decades  thanks \nto horizontal drilling and fracking technologies.  In addition, the public’s expectations for \ninflation have become better anchored following the Fed’s heightened response to inflationary \nshocks as well as its adoption  in 2012 of an inflation target .  As a result, today , oil price increases  \nlead to an increase in oil and gas production and a related increase in investment spending, \ntemporarily raising inflation but offsetting some or all of the adverse effect on aggregate \neconomic activity. Similarly, today, a sharp downturn in oil and gas p rices can put temporary \ndownward pressure on inflation  with benefits to consumers but adverse consequences for the \nenergy secto r – as we witnessed in 2014 -15.  Importantly, the inflationary effects are viewed as \ntemporary rather than persistent because of the anchoring of inflation expectations around 2 \npercent.  \nAlthough recent developments have muted the effects of oil price changes on the \neconomy  as a whole , they have to some extent increased volatility in the oil sector itself and in \n\n6 \n business capital exp enditures. For example, the oil and gas sector nationwide has experienced a \nsurge in output per rig and per worker.  From 2012 to 2017, productivity in the U.S. oil and gas \nextraction sector more than doubled.1  Associated with this increase in productivit y and along \nwith wide swings in oil prices , the number of rigs and workers required for production has fallen \ndramatically .   \n  Research by my staff finds that the energy sector has had a significant influence on \ninvestment spending in the U.S. economy, bo th to the upside and to the downside. From 2006 to \n2014, for example, total capex spending for U.S. publicly  traded firms rose roughly 41 percent. \nThis boost in spending was largely driven by energy investment, which grew  125 percent \ncompared to a more mod est 21 percent for non-energy investment. By the same token, after the \noil price decline in 2014 , energy investment plunged more than  50 percent over the following  \ntwo years .  Despite a modest 2 percent growth in non -energy investment spending over this \nperiod, total capex fell 15 percent . Variability in energy investment has had a sizable influence \non the broader investment landscape.2  \nOf course the shale oil boom also has had myriad effects on local economies that are \nheavily dependent on the oil and gas extraction industry.  Yesterday , I had the chance to tour the \nlarge oil storage facility in Cushing, just an hour west of here, to learn more about these \ndynamics.  Wor ld trade is an important issue today and it affects many local economies, \nincluding those involved in oil production.  For example, with the lifting of the oil export ban, \nwe’ve seen U.S. oil exports surge , and places like Cushing are dealing with export d elivery \nchallenges until investment in midstream and downstream capacity comes on line .   \n                                                 \n1 Chad Wilkerson . 2018.  “Oil and Gas Productivity Doubled in the Past Five Years —What Happens Next? ” \nOklahoma Economist , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, June 18.  \n2 David Rodziewicz, 2018. “ Energy Investment Variability within the Macroeconomy ,” Economic Review , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Third  Quarter.  \n\n7 \n A key question is whether this now abundant and accessible natural resource has , on net, \nhad a positive effect on local economic conditions. Some theories suggest res ource abundance \nmay increase local economic development through higher demand for labor in the energy sector \nand spillover spending in the local economy. Other theories, though, suggest industries not \nclosely related to the resource extraction industry may  be harmed as energy production expands. \nFor example, labor demand by the extraction industry may be high enough to bid up local wages, \nwhich in turn could pull employees from other lower -paying jobs and make it difficult for other \nindustries to survive. A t the national and international level, this phenomenon has been referred \nto as the “natural resource curse,” but the topic has received much less attention at the local \nlevel.  \nStaff at the Kansas City Fed took a look at this issue and examined how the bo om in the \nU.S. natural gas industry has affected local economies in the central United States. By looking at \nlabor market conditions at the county level in a nine -state region  including Oklahoma,  they \nanalyzed how employment and wages have responded to the  rapid expansion of natural gas \nproduction from 2001 to 2011. The key finding is that the gas boom had a modest but po sitive \nimpact on local labor market outcomes in counties where natural gas production has increased, \nand little evidence of a so-called natural resource curse.3 \nGiven the nature and scale of the  dramatic developments  in the energy sector , we \ncontinue to monitor this segment of our economy very closely, both in the Kansas City Fed \nregion and be yond.  We stay abreast of real-time trends throug h roundtable discussions with \nindustry executives, and we conduct a quarterly survey of our oil and gas firms  to monitor \nactivity .  Our third -quarter survey will be released tomorrow  morning .  We also host an annual \n                                                 \n3 Jason P.

This year’s conference focused on trends in world oil supply and demand, \nthe rising importance of energy trade, and the longer -term future of shale.  Overall, the \nconference atte ndees were relatively upbeat about the near -to-intermediate outlook for U.S. oil \nand gas, while recognizing that geopolitical risks could create volatility in the near term.4   \n \n \nConclusion  \n In closing , the U.S. economy is enjoying a long expansion . One particular bright spot in \nthe outlook is the strength of t he oil - and gas -producing sector.  As we assess the outlook for the \neconomy as a whole , it has becom e increasingly important to understand developments in the \nenergy sector to identify  industry -specific shocks and their possible spillovers to the broader \neconomy.   The Kansas City Fed and its Oklahoma City Branch in particular will continue to \nkeep tabs on these energy sector dynamics.  \n Looking ahead, there is good reason to expect continued moder ate growth, with a gradual \nslowing to more sustainable growth rates of both output and employment.

Today ’s discussion  has been bot h interesting and \ninformative. I want to thank the presenters and discussants for participa ting in this year’s \nsymposium. Clearly, international trade is central to the performance of the ag ricultural sector, \nand uncertainty about trade policy  clouds the outlook. I look forward to continuing the \ndiscussion tomorrow.  \nThis evening I would like to focus my remarks on the outlook for the U.S. economy and \nthe role of monetary policy in supportin g sustainable economic growth. With the economy at or \nbeyond most estimates of full employment and inflation near the FOMC’s  2 percent objective, \nmonetary  policy  should be a neu tral influence on the economy. However, i n my view, policy is \nstill providing accommodation . Gradual further increases in our poli cy rate will be necessary to \nreturn policy to a  neutral stance , although there is considerable uncertainty about exactly how far \nor fast we need to go. Thus, policy must thread th e needle between moving too slowly  toward \nneutral , which could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation, and moving too aggressively , \nwhich could precipitat e an economic downturn.    \n \nCurrent economic conditions  \n Let me turn first to current econ omic conditions. The U.S. economy  is in excellent shape,  \noperating with tight labor markets and  low and stable inflation. The unemployment rate  at 4.0 \npercent  is well below most estimates of full employment . In addition , headline inflation as \nmeasured by the Fed ’s preferred indicator, the personal consumption e xpenditure price index , \nrecently reached 2 .3 percent , while the core measure excluding food and energy came in at 2 \npercent —consistent with the Fed’s inflation objective.  \n\n \n \n2 \n  Looking back at the first half of the year, real GDP —our broadest measure of economi c \nactiv ity—increased at a solid pace. In fact, it accelerated from a moderate 2 percent annual rate \nin the first quarter to an expected growth rate of around 4 percent in the second quarter, based o n \nvarious GDP tracking models. Looking ahead, we expect co ntinued economic growth at or above \nestimates of the economy’s longer -run potential growth rate of around 1¾ percent . \n Economic growth is broad based, and the economy appears to be firing on all cylinders.  \nConsumer spending has supported overall economic growth since the beginning of the \nexpansion, but more recently, we have seen a pickup in business sp ending on plant and \nequipment. In addition, we are beginning to see a n increase in the pace of wage gains . For \nexample, the employment cost index —a broad me asure of labor compensation that accounts for \nemployment shifts among occupations and industries —accelerated over the past couple of years \nto a 2.7 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter, after having hovered for s everal years \naround 2 percent. These wage gains along with ongoing increases in employment will continue \nto support increases in personal income and spending over the remainder of the year and on into \nnext year.  \nWith this strong performance and a legacy of low interest rates, financial st ress may be \nbuilding in some sectors . The corporate bond market and subprime borrowers  appear to be at \nsome risk shoul d interest rates rise sharply. In addition, asset prices remain elevated . \nNevertheless , regulators have judged the financial system to be stable , with manageable \nvulnerabilities . They point, for example, to the most recent assessment from the annual stress -\ntesting of the largest banks . That said, I am concerned that regulators are not doing more to build \nresilient capital buffers into the ba nking system at a time of cyclical strength.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n The risks to the outlook  \n Aside from the possibility that we are misjudging the manageability of emerging  \nfinancial imbalances, the risks to the outlook appear balance d. Even so , the risks —both to the  \nupside and the downside —are significant.   \nThe predominant upside risk s in my view are a pro-cyclical U.S. fiscal policy and \nglobally accommodative monetary policies . While estimates of the stimulative effects vary, t he \nfederal government ’s actions  to cut taxes a nd increase spending have come during a business \ncycle expansion. These policies may have the short -run benefit of promoting spending and, \nperhaps, increasing the economy’s longer -run growth potential by increasing business \ninvestment, but they also carry a risk of pushing the economy beyond its productive capacity.  \nLikewise, accommodative monetary policies in the United States and other advance d economies \nencourag e risk-taking and incentiviz e spending over saving. At this point in the business cycle, \nsuch fiscal and monetary policies could lead to an undesirable increase in inflation or to a further \nbuildup of financial imbalances.  \nThe predominant downside risks come from uncertainty around trade policy.  To date, the \nimpact of new tariffs on the broad econ omy has been minimal, and I have not incorporated any \nsignificant effect into my baseline outlook for the broader U.S. economy. However, anecdotal \nreports from our business contacts suggest that some companies are taking a “wait and see” \napproach to new ca pital spending due to uncertainty about future trade policies . Whether this \nwill materially slow the economy over the next couple of years or threaten the sustainability of \nthe expansion i s something that I will be monitoring carefully . \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n Monetary policy m ust thread the needle  \nBarring the realization of these risks to the outlook, I continue to believe the stance of \nmonetary policy will need to be gradually adjusted toward a more neutral position.  At a time of \nfull employment with price stability, policy sh ould be a neutral influence on economic activity.  \nBut navigating the path to neutral will be challenging.  \nIn the first place, there is considerable uncertainty about what the neutral policy rate is \nand, therefore, uncertainty about how many policy moves it will take to return to neutral. Various \nstructural changes —such as slower growth of the labor force and sluggish productivity growth —\nsuggest the neutral policy rate is lower than in the past . But other, cyclical, factors may be \npartially offsetting.  In addition, fi scal stimulus is likely raising the neutral rate , but it is not clear \nby how much.   \nLikewise, questions exist about the natural rate of unemployment and the slope of the \nPhillips curve —and whether these concepts remain relevant in today’s econ omy.  The fact that \ninflation has been relatively stable even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below \nestimates of its longer -run sustainable level suggest s that either the Phillips curve is unusual ly \nflat or, perhaps, obsolete. That said, monetary policy is currently testing the limits of how low   \nunemployment can go without causing an undesir able increase in inflation.  \nMonetary policy is further complicated by the extraordinary actions central banks took to \npromote growth during and after the global financial crisis.  When unemployment was high and \ninflation was low relative to our targets, the F ederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) greatly \nexpanded the Fed’s  balance sheet and provide d forward guidance to the public that policy rates \nwould be ke pt low for a prolonged period. I don’t dispute that some of these policies may have \nhelped  get us to where we are today. But now that the FOMC has largely achieved its objectives, \n\n \n \n5 \n the costs of these extraordinary policy actions are becoming apparent. Even tho ugh we have \nbegun to gradually normalize the size of the balance sheet, it remains exceptionally large by \nhistorical standards. It is still likely putting downward pressure on longer -term rates, working at \nodds with efforts  to achieve policy neutrality. In addition, keeping rates “low for long” has \nresulted in a policy stance that remains accommodative in the face of tight labor markets and \ninflation at the FOMC’s goal . \n   Moreover, t raditional signals of the stance of policy , such as the slope of the yield  curve, \nhave likely become  distorted. A yield curve inversion —that is, a situation where short -term rates \nrise above longer -term rates —has historically been a strong signal that the economy might dip \ninto recession sometime over the next six months to two years. Except for once1, such an \ninversion  has always  been followed by a recession. While the yield curve has not yet inverted, it \nis relatively flat by historical standards, raising the possibility that further increases in policy \nrates could move them ab ove longer -term rates.   \nIt’s not clear how concerned we should be about this possibility. As I mentioned , the \nFed’s large holdings of Treasury securities may be  keeping longer -term rates below where they \notherwise would be and, therefore, distorting th e signal from the yield curve. In addition, the \nlevel of interest rates , as well as that of the neutral policy rate , is below historical benchmarks.2   \nWhile economic conditions are quite positive right now, i t is important that monetary \npolicy be calibrat ed over time to sustain the expansion . The stakes are high since policymakers  \nwill have less scope to lower rates in a future downturn. Monetary policy cannot offset all of the \nshocks that affect  the economy , and recessions will happen. But recessions can also be caused by \n                                                 \n1 The one time when an inverted  yield curve (10 -year treasury yield/3 -month treasury yield) did not immediately \nprecede a recession was in September 1998.  \n2 Bauer, Michael, and Thomas M. Mertens, “Economic Forecasts with the Yield Curve,” FRBSF Economic Letter , \nMarch 5, 2018.  \n\n \n \n6 \n policy mistakes. The FOMC will need to monitor incoming data carefully to avoid moving too \naggressively and causing a downturn  or moving too slowly and allowing inflation to rise.   \nAllowing inflation to rise also can result in a recession  if the Fed must then raise rates \naggressively to return inflation to target.    \nAdding to the complexity of monetary policy is that it affects the real econom y with long \nand variable lags. Past policy actions have not yet had their full effect, and actions  taken today \nwill not have their full effect for many months into the future. This raises the risk of \novershooting. Like adjusting the thermostat in a hot room to cool it down , failure to account for \nlags can lead one to continue tinkering with the control s. Because i t takes time to reach the \ndesired temperature, if you’re not careful, it’s easy to overshoot, turning a room that is too hot \ninto one that is too cold.  \nAll of this suggests to me that  future policy actions  will increasingly need to be data \ndependent. And given the policy lags, our actions need to be forward looking. In this context, \ndata dependence means that policymakers should adjust their forecasts and associated policy \npaths as necessary based on the flow of incoming data. Therefore , I will be monitoring signs that \nmight indicate whether we are nearing neutral or ha ve further to go. For example, further \ndownward movements in the unemployment rate or upward momentum in inflation would \nsuggest to me  that we have more work to do. On the  other hand, stabilization of inflation and \nunemployment around their current levels might suggest  less urgency for further policy action.  \n \nConclusion  \n Notwithstanding these challenges , the U.S. economy is currently in very good shape ,  \nunemployment is well below most estimates of its longer -run level , and inflation has mov ed up \n\n \n \n7 \n to the FOMC’s objective. My baseline outlook is for the expansion to continue at a moderate \npace, while recognizing  there are signific ant upside and downside risks. With a long -run view t o \nsustain the expansion, monetary policy will need to move from an accommodative st ance to a \nmore neutral stance. Threading this needle will be challeng ing in the face of numerous \nuncertainties and the ongoing complexity of unwinding the extraordinar y policy actions taken in \nthe aftermath of the global financial crisis."

We have much \nto learn from each other .  \nMy comments this afternoon  focus on some of the practical issues I think about as I \nformulate my own policy views . As I do so, y ou’ll hear me describe these issues with more \nquestions than answers , reflecting the nature of the policy landscape today .  \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not \nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nToday’s policy landscape  \nNine years after the financial crisis, the Fed has , at least for the moment,  achieved its \nobjectives of maximum employment and price stability . Yet the legacy of the crisis —through the \nresponse of the Fed and fiscal authorities —has left us in a very different place than before the \ncrisis  in a number of ways . The equilibrium nomina l policy rate is low  by historical standards . \nThe current target for the federal funds rate is considerably  lower than the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s  (FOMC)  projection of its longer -run value . Our balance sheet is almost five times \nits pre -crisis size . The Fed’s footprint in financial markets is considerably larger than before the \ncrisis. The banking sector is consolidating, and big banks have gotten even bigger . Federal \ndeficits and debt are high and projected to rise to unprecedented levels .  \nDespite  this legacy,  many of the structural developments that dominate our thinking \ntoday  were well underway before the onset of the financial crisis and Great Recession . An a ging \npopulation, slowing productivity growth, rising globalization and declining equilib rium interest \n\n2 \n rates all pre -date the crisis. In this sense, things have not changed . Moreover, since the mid-\n1990s and through the financial crisis , Great Recession, and current expansion, core inflation —\nas measured by the personal consumption expenditure price index —has fluctuated in a relatively \nnarrow range of roughly 1 percent to 2 ½ percent .  \nGiven the structural changes that have been developing over the last several d ecades, it \nmay well be that we are in a low -growth, low -interest -rate environment . Yet, from a cyclical \nperspective, the economy appears to be operating at or beyond full employment with inflation \nexpected to rise over the medium term , while the FOMC’s funds rate target of 1½ percent to  1¾ \npercent remains well below the FOMC’s projection  of its longer -run level of about 3 percent . \nThe current gradual normalization of interest rates is geared toward removing accommodation at \na pace that is expected to sustain the expansion without generating undesired increases in \ninflation on the one hand , or creating  financial instability on the other . But there are clearly risks .  \nAnd there are still uncertainties about how the landscape will look once policy has \nachieved a “new normal.” In particular, questions remain to be answered about the Fed’s futu re \noperating framework , its strategic framework  and it s role in promoting financial stability . I’ll \ndiscuss each of these issues in turn .  \n \nDetermining a long-run operating framework  \n In 2016, the FOMC  held lengthy discussions about potential long -run frameworks for \nmonetary policy implementation . The Committee discussed  the merits of maintaining an \nabundance of reserves in the banking system versus returning to a framework of reserve scarcity . \nWith an abundance of reserves, the Fed would rely on interest on reserves and the overnight \nreverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) to maintain control over short -term market rates . With \n\n3 \n a scarcity of re serves , the open market desk at the New York Fed would  control market rates \nthrough its control over the supply of reserves . The discussion ended with agreement that \n“decisions regarding the long -run implementation framework were not necessary at this time.”1 \nSince that time, however, w e have begun to normalize our ba lance sheet  with an understanding \nthat the balance sheet will be smaller than it is today, but larger than it was in 2007 . As the \nbalance sheet continues its steady decline, I would suggest that we again need to consider the \nappropriate long-run size of th e balance sheet and our related operating framework .  \n While it may simply be a case of nostalgia on my part, I found our minimalist  pre-crisis \noperating framework to have a number of features that served us well for many years . We \nmaintained a small balan ce sheet with liabilities that were comprised almost entirely of currency \nin circulation with reserves averaging about $10 billion, compared with more than $2 trillion \ntoday . We maintained a Treasuries -only balance sheet with duration -matching Treasury iss uance \nto maintain a neutral influence on financial markets . We had a small number of counterparties, \nand we managed the supply of reserves to achieve the target federal funds rate . As a result, our \nfootprint in the financial markets was relatively small .  \nRelative to this pre-crisis framework, the current operating framework —made necessary \nby a large balance sheet —has had a number of undesirable consequences, some of which were \nunintended . The Fed now owns significant outstanding shares of Treasur ies and mortgage -\nbacked securities ( MBS ) and is no longer a neutral influence on financial markets . We have a \nlarge number of counterparties , including nonbanks , made necessary by the ON RRP facility . \nIncreases in the funds rate are achieved by raising an administ ered rate —the interest rate on \nexcess reserves  (IOER) . Some have expressed concern that  as IOER goes up, payments to \nbanks —including to foreign banks —go up . Finally, the nature of unconventional policies has \n                                                 \n1 Federal Open Market Committee Minutes, November 1 -2, 2016 . \n\n4 \n drawn both attention and criticism to the Federa l Reserve’s large balance sheet with conequences \nfor central bank independence and fiscal discipline . Congress has begun to  see the Federal \nReserve as a source for plugging spending gaps , drawing on the Fed  to fund the Consumer \nFinancial  Protection Bureau , finance highway spending , and more recen tly, to contribute $2.5 \nbillion to the federal government from its capital surplus as part of the budget deal passed in \nFebruary after the brief government shutdown .  \nGiven these developments, the current thrust of policy can become more difficult to \ngauge . At the same time the funds rate is being normalized , we have embarked on a program to \ngradually reduce the Fed’s security holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments . \nWhile I support this policy —with balance sheet normalization occurring largely on auto -pilot \nand in the background —it does pose challenges as we try to understand the implications for the \nstance of policy . Is policy tighter than  we think because t he balance sheet is shrinking? Or is the \nstill-large balance sheet  putting downward pressure on longer -term rates making policy more \naccommodat ive than we think?   \nWhether  it is desirable or even possible to return to our pre-crisis operating framework  \nremains an open question for the FOMC . Can we  return to the corridor -like framework with \nscarce reserves, o r will we need to retain the current floor system?  If we maintain the current \nsystem, by how much can we reduce the supply of reserves ?  And what is the eventua l role of the \nON RRP facility? Can IOER guide the funds rate without reliance on the floor esta blished by the \nrate on ON RRPs?  Answers to these questions will be shaped by the FOMC’s future discussions.  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n Strategic f ramework  \nIn addition to uncertainties about the longer -run operating fra mework, a number of \nstrategic challenges and uncertainties  pose practical issues for policymakers . With little \ncountercyclical policy space available to respond to a future downturn , monetary policy options \nmust contemplate how interest rate an d balance sh eet policies will work before, during and after \na crisis . Aggressively purchasing assets in a downturn and only gradually allowing them to roll \noff once the economy has fully recovered suggests the possibility of a balance sheet th at grows \nbigger and bigge r over time .  \nThis dynamic , combined with varying degrees of uncertainty  about the efficacy of asset \npurchases , has led to calls for a discussion about future policy strategies for the next encounter \nwith the zero lower bound . Ideas like price -level targeting, a higher inflation objective  or \nnominal GDP targeting all offer worthwhile and intellectually stimulating debate . And certainly \nthe time is right to consider the trade -offs around various strategies , but determining if these \nideas might work in practice is challenging .  \n \nPromoting Financial S tability  \nThese uncertainties make it all the more important to ensure the current economic \nexpansion is sustained as interest rates rise and the balance sheet normalizes. We should take \nevery measure possible  to prevent  a crisis rather than hope that we can devise a monetary policy \ncure after the fact.  \n \n\n6 \n As the FOMC gradually mov es away from the zero lower bound, with a slowly shrinking \nbut still -large balance sheet and growing federal debt, maintaining financ ial stability  is \nparamount .  \nHere I would like to make two key points .  \n First, in contemplating a future bout of financial instability , we should be realistic \nabout the robustness of macroprudential tools with a good dose of humility \naround the necessary finesse to deploy  them  in a timely fashion .  \n Second, we should not waver in our aims t o bolster resilience in our banking \nsystem especially for the largest banks .2  \nThere is little dispute  that financial stability is a necessary condition for achieving the \nFOMC’s employment and price stability mandates . It is recognized in  the FOMC’s “Statement of \nLonger -Run Goals and Strategies ” as well as being the objective of macroprudential policies . \nHowever, there remains a tension as to the trade -off between macroecon omic goals and financial \nstability . The “lean or clean” debate is ongoing . Specifically, some argue that the output losses \nassociated with using monetary policy to lean against growing financial imbalances far outweigh \nthe possible benefits . Instead, they suggest that macroprudential policies are the appropriate \nresponse to financial instability . In my view , this approach might be more effective  in theory \nthan in practic e.  \nA few years ago , I participated with some of my colleagues in a tabletop exercise \ndesigned to assess the efficacy of certain macroprudential policy tools in responding to a \nhypothetical financial crisis . In the exercise, we examined the use of capital -based, liquidity -\nbased, and credit -based tools, along with stress testing and supervisor y guidance in mitigating \n                                                 \n2 The eight U.S. global systemically important banks (GSIBs) held $11 trillion in total assets at the end of 2017, an \namount equal to 57 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.  \n\n7 \n the effects of an overheating of the financial markets . What we discovered in conducting the \nexercise was that the effectiveness of the tools varied because  of realities like implementation \nlags and/or limited scope . In addition, m onetary polic y looked to be a relatively more attractive \noption than some  might have expected before the exercise.3  Obviously this particular exercise is \nnot conclusive in all scenarios, but rather a caution about becoming overly confident in relying  \non macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances .  \nIn thinking about the role of financial stability in the conduct of monetary policy, I find \nrecent research from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)  to be compelling . This \nresearch sees financial market deregulation from the 1980s and 1990s as having increased the \nlikelihood of crises and posit s a growing financial cycle in which monetary policy responds \nasymmetrically over time to crises, easing rate s aggressively during the crisis bu t raising rates \nonly gradually  after the crisis has subsided . Their prescription  is for policymakers to break this \ncycle by making policy more attentive to financial imbalances and more symmetrical in the \nresponse.4  \nWe should take advantage of the current  economic conditions to bolster resilience in the \nfinancial system . Instead, the U.S. has yet to implement  a countercyclical buffer  and the banking \nagencies contemplate steps in the direction of relaxing capital requirements . Recently issued for \ncomment is a proposal to modify  the enhanced suppleme ntary leverage ratio on global \nsystemically important banks (GSIBs ) that would have the effect of lowering capital \nrequirements.5 With the U.S. ec onomy in a sustained expansion  and at risk of growing financial \n                                                 \n3 Tobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “ Macro -prudential Policy: A Case Study \nfrom a Tabletop Exercise ,” FRBNY Economic Policy Review , February 2017.  \n4 Claudio Borio, Piti Disyatat, Mikael Juselius, and Phurichai Rungcharoenkitkul, “ Monetary Policy in the Grip of a \nPincer Movement ,” BIS Working Paper No. 706.  \n5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 2018. “R ule Proposed to Tailor 'Enhanced Supplementary \nLeverage Ratio' Requirements .” Press release, April 11 .

And a number of long-running structural trends have become \nprominent considerations for understanding their  implications  for future growth . This landscape \nis accompanied by an economy growing at or above trend with full emp loyment , stable prices  \nand easy settings for monetary policy . Whatever the “new normal ” is, monetary policy is not yet \nthere . When times are good, as they are now, it is an opportune time to resolve some of the \nuncertainties around how we will implement mo netary policy in the future, what strategies we \nwill employ in response to the next downturn, and how can we best promote resilience and \nstability in our financial system . I hope we do so befor e we find ourselves cleaning up after the \nnext crisis ."

As a  regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the \neconomic landscape of our District from visits like this one, where I have the opportunity to meet \nwith business and community leaders.  Your comments  and concerns about the econ omy, \ncombined with economic data and analysis, help inform my own views on monetary policy.  \n My remarks t his evening  will focus on the state of the economy and the current stance of \nmonetary policy.  In particular, I  want to highlight some key dynamics of the labor market, as we \nare experiencing the confluence of several cyclical and structural trends that are collectively \nreshaping the job market in Nebraska and the nation as a whole .   \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views  and are not \nnecessarily representative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe Nebraska Economy  \nAs we heard earlier tonight , the Nebraska economy  is relatively strong  and its \nunemployment rate is historically low.  I’d like to use the lens of the labor market to describe the \nopportunities and challenges that the state faces  as you collectively work to build and support a \nstrong economy.    \nRelative to th e nation, Nebraska has a strong  labor market with an unemployment rate \nbelow  the U.S. national average.  Just over a decade ago, prior to the financial crisis, Nebraska \nhad an unemployment rate of about 3 percent.  Following the financial crisis and during the \nrecession that ensued, Nebraska’s unemployment rate rose to about 5 percent , far less than the \nnational unemployment rate, which rose to 10 percent.  And at this current point in the ongoing \n\n3 \n economic expansion, Nebraska’s unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, suggesting that the labor \nmarket is tighter now across the state than it wa s back in 2007.  \nThis is very good news for the state as a whole, but it masks several underlying trends \nthat reveal that this improvement has not been experienced equall y across all parts of the state  \nand for all workers in the economy.   Within Nebraska, e mployment growth has been \nconcentrated in metro areas, particularly in Omaha and Lincoln, while the rural parts of the state \nhave struggled .  During the past four year s, employment in Nebraska ’s metro areas  has grown at \nan annual rate of 1.5 percent, while  in that same time there has been no empl oyment growth in \nnon-metro areas  of the state.  This widening divide of economic opportunities between rural and \nmetro areas represents a growing concern for our region and is a topic that the research staff at \nthe Kansas City Fed  will be analyzing . \nA second important trend that has broad implic ations for Nebraska’s economy is the \nongoing demographic shift in its  population.  During the past decade, Nebraska’s population of \nindividuals age 16 and above has grown by 8  percent.  But a large share of this population, the \nbaby boomers, are moving toward retirement, which implies that the labor force of available \nworkers may not be growing as quickly.  In fact, the number of prime -age individuals in \nNebraska, those aged 25  to 54, has actually declined by 3½ percent over the past decade.  If this \ntrend continues with an aging population that is not fully replaced by the next generation of \nworkers, this will create a significant headwind for growth prospects for the  state eco nomy .   \nAnd a third trend influencing the labor market is the ongoing shift in the types of skill s \nemployers demand .  In the past 40 years, advances in technology and computing , along with \nshifts toward an increasingly global economy , have dramatically alt ered the employment \nopportunities that firms are seeking to fill.  Jobs that were available in the past to workers with a \n\n4 \n high school degre e, such as assembly line work  in manufacturing plants and c lerical jobs  in \noffices, have  largely been automated.  As  those jobs ha ve gone away, new jobs have emerged, \nbut many require technical skills that workers need to obtain through training programs or \nadvanced education.   \nHow best to prepare our youth and young workers for success in this economy  is a \nchallenge facing Nebraska, along with the rest of the country .  In particular, young men are \nstruggling to adapt to this shift in employment opportunities .  A recent article in the Kansas City \nFed’s Economic Review  by Didem T üzemen describes how this  shift has contributed to an \nincrease d number of prime -age men who are leaving the labor force.1  Those men typically have \nonly a high school diploma and perhaps some college education.  For Nebraska, the share of \nprime -age men who are actively engaged in the labor force has declined by 1 percent during the \npast decade, which implies that approximately 10,000 men who would have been working in \nNebraska’s economy a decade ago are now sitting on the sidelines  and not looking for work \nbecause their skills are not in demand by employers.  \nBut this is also a national dilemma with no easy answers.  In addition to the slowdown in \nthe growth rate of the labor force due to the retirement of baby boomers , the missing prime -age \nmale workers are another  headwind on the n ational economy’s productive capacity.   \nLet me turn now to the outlook for the U.S. economy which, from a cyclical  perspective, \nlooks very robust, aside from this very challenging issue.  \n \nThe U.S. E conomic Outlook  \n                                                 \n1 Tüzemen, Didem. “ Why Are Prime -Age Men Vanishing from the Labor Force? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity. Economic Review, First Quarter, 2018.  \n\n5 \n Almost nine years into the current expans ion, t he U.S. economy has, by most accounts, \nachieved full employment while maintaining a low and stable inflation rate. Preliminary \nestimates suggest that real GDP  — our broadest measure  of economic activity  — grew at an \nannual rate of just under 3 percent in the second half of last year .  Looking ahead, most \nforecasters expect continued moderate growth somewhat above the economy’s potential growth \nrate of roughly 1¾  percent  to 2 percent.  Such growth will likely lead to tighter conditions in \nlabor  and product  market s and, possibly, higher inflation.  As a result, the Federal Open Market \nCommittee —the Fed’s monetary policymaking body —has been g radually remov ing monetary \naccommodation by slowly increasing its target interest rate and allowing its balan ce sheet to \nshrink.   \nThat’s my outlook in a nutshell.  Let me now provide some detai ls in support of my \nperspective .   \nOne of the key drivers of the expansion has been consumer spending.  Consumers \nmaintained a moderate pace of spending during this econom ic expansion, generally in line with  \nthe moderate pace of income growth we have been seeing.  Looking forward, I expect consumers \nto continue providing a significant amount of support for this economic expansion, as jobs \ncontinue to be added and wage growt h is beginning to pick up in response to a tightening labor \nmarket. Recent changes to personal taxes will likely provide a modest boost to household \nspending this year and allow households to pay down debt , which has continued to grow \nthroughout the expans ion.  Over t ime, the contribution of the tax plan to consumer spending is \nlikely to fade , but still remain positive for spending as labor market conditions tighten . \nAdditional momentum to the economy has come from business spending on plant and \nequipment.  Business investment grew almost 6¼ percent in 2017, which represents a welcome \n\n6 \n step up from the negligible rate of growth during  the previous three years.  Equipment \ninvestment in particular has strengthened in re sponse to stronger global demand for U.S. \nmanufactured goods and commodities. In the last four quarters, it grew almost 9 percent.    \nLooking ahead,  the lower corporate tax rate and more favorable tax treatment of \ninvestment spending are expected to provide  a further modest boost to business spending  in the \ncoming years.  Longer -term factors, however, such as sluggish productivity growth and a \nsubdued rate of growth in the working -age population, are likely to remain a drag on investment \nspending going forwar d.  Intangible investment, such as in intellectual property and \ntechnological know -how, is likely to continue growing in importance relative to investment in \nphysical structures and machinery.   \nThe housing sector presents more of a mixed picture, with resi dential investment \nfluctuating around a moderate upward trend that is likely to persist.  Construction activity is \nconstrained by a shortage of qualified workers, difficulty obtaining financing by small builders, \nand the limited availability of undeveloped  land in desired locations.  Single -family sales are \nbeing significantly constrained by limited home listings. In contrast, demand for housing remains \nvery strong.  Many young adults who moved in  with their parents or found housemates following \nthe Great R ecession would now like to form their own househo lds but are finding  a lack of \nmoderately -priced apartments and houses. Similarly, f amilies who would like to upgrade from \nstarter single -family ho mes are also finding a  limited number of homes available for sale. With \nstrong demand but limited new supply, rents and sales prices are likely to continue to move up \nbriskly, even as mortgage rates normalize from the very low levels of recent years.  \n\n7 \n Finally, the national econo my will get a small boost in growth from federal government \nspending.  The  two-year budget agreement that Congress recently passed  raises spending caps \nfor fiscal year 2018 and 2019, allowing nearly $400 billion in additional spending.   \nWith this outlook,  I view inflation dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s goal of price stability.  Year -over-year inflation is currently running just under the \nFederal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent  as measured by the personal consumption expenditure \nprice index.  But I would expect to see inflation rising this year to around 2 percent.  This \nincrease r eflect s continued economic growth  at or above its long -run potential, a further \ntightening of labor markets, and rising import prices stemming from stro ng global demand.  \nRisks to the outlook appear to be predominately to the upside.  The sectors that were \nheadwinds on growth in the final quarter of last year suggest considerable momentum going into \nthe current year.  Imports, which subtracted almos t 2 pe rcentage points from the fourth  quarter \ngrowth rate, point to considerable domestic demand.  Likewise , inventories, which subtracted 0.7 \npercentage point from overall economic growth, should be a source of strength this year as \nproducers restock their shel ves. In addition, as I will discuss in a moment , monetary policy \nremains highly accommodative, and the recently enacted tax cuts and federal government \nspending increases suggest fiscal policy has turned more stimulative.  On top of these domestic \ndemand f actors, a synchronized global recovery , in which foreign demand for our goods and \nservices ,remain s quite solid , should contribute to the momentum going forward.  \n \nMonetary policy  \nLet me now turn to a review of monetary policy.  Although we have largely achieved our \nobjectives for maximum employment and price stability, the stance of monetary policy remains \n\n8 \n quite accommodative . The fed eral funds rate, which is  the overnight interest rate  the Federal \nReserve target s, remains well below estimates of its longer -run value of around 3 percent.  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by \nhistorical standards due to  the FOMC’s large -scale purchases of longer -term Treasury and \nagency debt beginning in 200 8.  These programs , commonly referred as quantitative easing or \nQE, ended in October 2014 , and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce our \nholdings of Treasury and agency securities started last fall . By the end of this year, however, \nonly ab out a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s balance sheet resulting from the first round of \nlarge scale asset purchases will be unwound.   \nThese holdings of longer -term assets were intended to put downward pressure on  longer -\nterm interest rates.  Many inves tors responded, as would be expected, by purchasing riskier \nassets in a reach for higher yield.  As a result, asset prices may have become distorted relative to \nthe economic fundamentals.  The very slow pace of our balance sheet normalization may still be \ncontributing to a buildup of various financial imbalances.  While until r ecently, financial markets \nremained remarkably stable, it is not uncommon to see volatility rise when asset prices become \ninflated and investors struggle to find a new equilibrium.   \nWhat then should the stance of monetary policy be at this stage in the business cycle?  \nMonetary policy can be a useful tool to lean against the ups and downs of the business cycle, but \nit is not well suited to address structural problems in the economy such as job polarization. When \neconomic conditions reflect the combination of full employment, price stability and trend \neconomic growth —as they more or less do now —monetary policy should be a neutral influence \non the economy.  But the current setting of o ur target interest rate is still well below neutral.  I t \n\n9 \n is, therefore,  important that the FOMC continue on its current path of policy normalization with \ngradual increase s in the target federal funds rate.  \n \nConclusion  \n In closing, the good news is that th e U.S. economy is currently growing at a moderate \npace, with full employment and price stability.  As always, some regions and industries are doing \nbetter than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good.  At the same time, monetary \npolicy remai ns accommodative.  To sustain the expansion without pushing the economy beyond \nits capacity limits and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for the Federal Reserve \nto continue its gradual normalization of interest rates.  Given the current  momentum in the \neconomy, the FOMC will need to carefully calibrate its policy to lean against a potential buildup \nof inflationary pressure or financial market imbalances."

I appreciate the opportunity to join  you here this evening.  \nThe Tenth Federal Re serve Distric t covers a very large geography  and keeping tabs on \neconomic conditions in the region is an important aspect of my work .  Fortunately, I have a small \ngroup of economists at the Bank who  conduct research,  analyze data and survey key sectors of \nthe economy , but I also rely on individuals across the region who serve on our various boards \nand advisory groups.  The input and perspective of these individuals  and other contacts are key \nto our understanding of the economic conditions and emerging risks facing our region and the \nnation. The ir contributions  help to shape my views as I represent my region at the Federal Open \nMarket Committee (FOMC) .  In fact, t here are a number of individuals from the Wichita area \nwho assist th e Federal Reserve in this way,  and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge \nthem .  \nTrish Minard with Southwest National Bank here in Wichita, Kan. , recently joined the \nKansas City Fed’s Board of Directors. Although the Federal Reserve Board of Governor s in \nWashington, D.C., has oversight responsibilities  for the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks , each \nBank also  operate s under the leadership of a Board of Director s. This structure was designed by \nCongress to carefully balance public and private interests  in the oversight of the nation’s central \nbank.  The goal was to ensure broad representation in the Fed’s important policy deliberations \nwith ample opportunity for discussion and disagreement , while also providing insulation from \nthose who might seek to in fluence policy decisions for short -term political gain.  As a result, the \nindividuals who serve  on our board have a very important responsibility  within the Fed’s \nstructure .  \n\n3 \n Dan Solomon, chief financial officer  of Koch Chemical Technology Group, has been \ninvolved with our Ec onomic Advisory Council for several years , and I have appreciate d his \ninsights on regional, national and global economic trends .   \nI’d also like to recognize Michael DeBroeck, senior vice president with Intrust Bank , and \nBob Thurman, chief executive officer  of Credit Union of America, who have served on our \nPayments Advisory Group .  Additionally , Steve Radley, president of NetWork Kansas in \nAndover , serves  as a member of our Community Development Advisory Council – a group that \nregular ly informs and advises us on conditions in low-, and moderate -income communities . My \nthanks to each of these individuals for their service to the Kansas City Fed and for the \ncontributions they make to monetary policy deliberations.  \nWe have a lot going at t he Fed r ight now. At last week ’s FOMC meeting , we said our \nfarewells to Janet Yellen , whose term as Fed chair has ended. And on Monday  of this week , Jay \nPowell took the oath of office as the Fed’s new chairman .  He  is an experienced Fed governor \nwhose serv ice on the Board of Governors began in 2012.   Having worked with him the past \nseveral years, I think you can expect that Fed policy will continue along its current path , and I \nexpect a smooth transition.  \nOf course , this week’s headlines have been f ocused o n the market’s reaction to last \nFriday’s employment report and potential inflation  risks . So, this evening, I’ll share with you my \nviews on the outlook for the nation’s economy and the challenges ahead for the Federal Open \nMarket Committee over the near - and long er-term. I’ll plan to leave time a t the end of my \nremarks  to take your questions, comments or advice.  \n\n4 \n Before continuing, now would be a good time to remind you that the views I express this \nevening are my own and not those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee.   \n \nCurrent econom ic conditions  \nThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy are sound.  Preliminary estimates suggest that real \nGDP  — our broadest measure  of economic activity  — grew at an annual rate of just under 3 \npercent in the second half of last year  with robust consumer activity and  a solid increase in \nbusiness spending on fixed investment.   \nThis current expansion has been a long one and it has draw n millions of Americans into \nthe workforce as labor markets have strengthened.  The unemployment rate has fallen to a \nhistorically low 4.1 percent.  Here in Wichita, labor market conditions are somewhat tighter with \nthe unemployment rate at 3.8 percent.  \nHiring remains solid with payroll employment gains averaging 192,000 per month over \nthe last three months . But t he pace  of payroll gains has been gradually slow ing since the peak in \n2014, and I expect those numbers will decelerate further as labor markets continue to tighten and \nfirms find filling job openings increasingly difficult .  \nAs labor markets have tightened, compensation for workers has increased.  This is a \nwelcome development because wage growth has been fairly modest through muc h of the current \nexpansion.   \nAnother favorable aspect of the current expansion is that inflation has remained low even \nas the economy has experienced above -trend growth and a tightening job market.  This has \nhelped workers by allowing wage increases to out pace inflation.  Year -over-year inflation is \n\n5 \n currently running just under the Federal Reserve’s objective of 2 percent , although I expect it \nwill begin to rise as labor markets tighten further and global demand  pushes up import prices .  \nTaken together, the se current conditions and the near -term outlook appear quite rosy.  \nYou might think in a scenario like this, Federal Reserve policymakers would have  an opportunity \nto relax a bit. Unfortunately , that is not the case.  \n \nNear -term challenges  \nAlthough the fina ncial crisis is now well behind us, and we have largely achieved our \nobjectives for employment and inflation, the stance of monetary policy remains quite \naccommodative . The fed eral funds rate, which is  the overnight interest rate  we target , remains \nwell be low estimates of its longer -run value of around 3 percent.  \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remains extraordinarily large by \nhistorical standards due to  the FOMC’s large -scale purchases of longer -term Treasury and \nagency debt beginning in 2007.  These programs , commonly referred to as quantitative easing or \nQE, ended in October 2014 and the process of shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet to reduce these  \nholdings started last fall . By the end of this year, only about a quarter of the increase to the Fed’s \nbalance sheet resulting from the first round of large scale asset purchases will be unwound.   \nAs monetary  policy accommodation is gradually withdraw n, the economy is getting  a \nboost from fiscal policy related to the recent tax bill . How much of a boost is hard to tell at this \nstage .  \nIn our surveys of manufacturers across our District , the expectations of future activity \nhave increased since the bill was signed. This is potentially good news for Wichita, where the \neconomy is heavily reliant on  manufacturing , a sector that  experienced a net job loss last year. \n\n6 \n Overall, I expect that l ower personal tax rates will boost aggregate demand, and that a lower \ncorporate tax rate and the more favorable tax treatment of investment spending will increase \naggregate supply, although it is difficult to predict exactly how and when consum ers and \nbusinesses will respond .  \nThe result is that an uncertain degree of fiscal stimulus is arriving at the same time the \neconomy is operating at or beyond full employment and monetary policy remains \naccommodative.   And because of that, it is important that the FOMC continue s on its current \npath of policy normalization with gradual increase s in the target federal funds rate. The median \nprojection from the FOMC’s Summary of E conomic Projections calls for about three, 25  basis \npoint hikes in the federal funds rate this year and about the same number next year. This is a \nreasonable basel ine unless the outlook changes  materially .  \n \nLonger -run challenges  \nWhile t hreading this policy needle will be a key challenge over the next couple of years, \nthere are also a number of structural developments that could pose challenges over the longer \nrun.  The nature of these structural issues is beyond the scope of monetary poli cy to address, but \nthey will nevertheless have implications for economic growth, employment and inflation and \ndeserve careful monitoring.  \nAmong these is the slowdown that we have seen over the last several years in the \neconomy’s potential growth rate. This  is the rate of growth consistent with maintaining the Fed’s \ndual mandate of price stability and full employment. By most estimates, this rate was falling \nbefore the financial crisis and is currently believed to be about one -half of what it was in the \n1990 s.  This slowdown in the economy’s potential growth stems from slower growth in the size \n\n7 \n of the potential  work force and the productivity  of that workforce .  Due largely to demographic \nchanges, especially  the retiring of the Baby Boom generation, the annual  growth rate of our labor \nforce is only a little better than one -third of what it was in the 1990s. At the same time, \nproductivity growth is about one -half what it was in the 1990s. Both of these unfavorable trends \nare projected to persist over the next de cade.  While these projections are highly uncertain, if they \nprove accurate, we can expect , among other things, a slower rate of improvement in living \nstandards relative to the pre -crisis period.   \nSlower potential growth also has some troubling implication s from a monetary policy \nperspective .  For one thing, it has led many economists to lower their estimate of the interest rate \nthat is consistent with full employment and price stability. Currently, the FOMC’s median \nprojection for the longer -run federal funds rate is around 3 percent, which is considerably below \nwhat it was only a few years ago . This means that a future FOMC may have substantially less \nroom to lower the federal funds rate should conditions warrant an increase in monetary stimulus.   \nIn such situation s, for example a future recession,  it might prove  helpful for fiscal policy to step \nin and provide a countercyclical stimulus.   \nBut that leads me to another structural challenge —the unsustainable trend of government \ndebt. This will make  it difficult for fiscal policy to play that countercyclical role.   \nThe federal budget deficit increased as a share of GDP for the third straight year in fiscal \n2017, and it was widely expected to creep higher over time even before the recent tax cuts.  \nDemographic trends will raise government spending as an increasing share of the population \nreceives retirement and health care benefits.  Additionally, health care costs are projected to \ngrow faster than the economy, as are the federal government’s net inte rest costs.   \n\n8 \n In all, federal debt held by the public, which was equal to about 35 percent of GDP \nbefore the recession, is now up to 7 5 percent of GDP.  It is projected to exceed its historical \n(WWII) peak of 106 percent by the 2030s , barring a shift in fis cal policy.  The nation remains far \nfrom a fiscal crisis, but changes will be necessary to put government debt on a sustainable \ntrajectory in the coming decades.  The sooner these changes can be made , the less drastic they \nwill need to be and the better po sitioned fiscal policy will be to take a more prominent counter -\ncyclical role in any future downturn.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing, over the longer run, demographic trends and sluggish productivity point to the \npossibility of slower economic growth and higher f iscal deficits.   These structural developments \nhave the potential to complicate monetary policy.  If the neutral rate of interest remains \nhistorically low, monetary policy may have less scope to stimulate the economy in a downturn \nwithout again resorting to unconventional policies such as asset purchases.  A natural response to \nsuch a situation would be to rely more heavily on fiscal policy.  However, the longer -run fiscal \noutlook suggests that fiscal policy may be similarly constrained.  Thus, it is criti cal that the \nlonger -run budget issues associated with our aging population be addressed sooner rather than \nlater.    \nIn the near term , the good news is that the U.S. economy is currently growing at a \nmoderate pace, with full employment and price stability.   As always, some regions and industries \nare doing better than others but, on the whole, economic conditions are good.  At the same time, \nmonetary policy remains accommodative.  To sustain the expansion without pushing the \n\n9 \n economy beyond its capacity limit s and creating inflationary pressures, it will be important for \nthe Federal Reserve to continue its gradual normalization of interest rates."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 11, 2017  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Thank you . It’s a lways a  pleasure to join you at the  Central Exchange .  \nThe U.S. economy has now entered its ninth year of expansion, and labor mark ets have \nnormalized . Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has averaged 2. 1 percent over the last \nseven  years, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 200 9 to 4.2 percent today . \nOverall, the economy looks to be in good shape.  \nDespite this positive  news , there has been a great deal of attention focused on inflation . \nNot because the inflation rate is high like it was in the early 1980s, but rather because it is low . \nBased on the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation —the Personal Consumption \nExpenditure s (PCE) price index —the current inflation rate is running just under 1.5 percent . Of \ncourse, this is an aggregate measure of inflation . If a specific component of the  consumption \nbasket is taking a greater bite out of your paycheck,  such as the rental cost of housing, you might \nfeel inflation is plenty high . On the other hand, you mig ht find that the price of a big -screen \ntelevision  is more affordable . Taken together, this preferred measure of inflation includes a \ncollection of  hundreds of different individual prices, gets revised periodically, and doesn’t take \ninto account asset price inflation .  \nNow you may be asking yourself “what’s wrong with low inflation?”  It’s a fair question \nand one I plan to address  in my remarks today . I’ll talk ab out why I believe that, in the context of \na growing economy at full employment, low inflation is not a current worry . I’ll also review \nsome of the factors that are contributing to soft inflation readings and talk about the implications \nfor monetary  policy .  \nBefore continuing, I must tell you that any views I share are wholly my own.  \n \n \n\n2 \n Why the FOMC targets 2 percent inflation   \nAs background, let me explain why inflation plays a prominent role in the Fed’s policy \ndecisions . You may know  that Congress has given the Federal Reserve a mandate that is  spelled \nout in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 , and it specif ies that the Federal Reserve \n“promote … maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”  Th is \nmandate is  often referred to as  a “dual mandate ” because moderate long -term interest rates are \nthe expected result of achieving the goals of maximum employment and stable prices .  \nHistorically , the price stability mandate was viewed largely in qualitative terms . For \nexample, for mer Fed Chairs Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan defined price stability as a state in \nwhich expectations of inflation  are not a pervasive influence on economic and financial behavior . \nOver time, however, as major central banks around the world —including, first, the Reserve Bank \nof New Zealand, then the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , and the European Central Bank  \n—adopted inflation targets , the F ederal Reserve began considering a numerical inflation \nobjective for the United States . Seeing how  inflation targets in other countries were  viewed to \nhave helped successful ly bring inflation down from undesirably high levels and stabiliz e it near \ntarget , man y academics and policymakers advocated a numerical inflation ob jective for the \nFedera l Reserve. This was despite inflation having already stabiliz ed at moderate rates in the \nUnited States in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s  and early 2000s .  \nAfter several years of debating the merits of an explicit numerical inflation objective, the  \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  adopted a 2 percent inflation objective  in January \n2012 .1  In its  “Statement of Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy St rategy,”  the FOMC stated \n                                                 \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19960703meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20050202meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20070321meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20101015confcall.pdf , \n\n3 \n that “inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change  in the price index for \npersonal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal \nReserve’s statutory mandate.”2   \nThe Committee chose 2 percent as its objective based on a number of factors . One factor \nwas a consideration of the costs of inflation . When inflation is much above 2 percent, relative \nprice signals get distorted, uncertainty about the future price level increases, and income is \narbitrarily transferred from creditors and savers to borrowers . On the other hand, some argue that \ninflation much below 2 percent also could be  costly . For example, when inflation is low, nominal \ninterest rates tend to be low . As a result, there is less room to cut rates in an economic downturn \nand policymakers could be faced with resort ing to unconventional policy instruments when \ninterest rates are at zero , as occurred in 2008 .  \nAt the time the target was adopted  in 2012 , inflation in the United States appeared to be \nanchored near 2 percent , and m any other central banks had adopted 2 per cent as either the center \nof a target range for inflation or as a specific  target . In addition , monetary policy was highly \naccommodat ive in 2012 , with the policy interest rate near zero and t he Fed’s balance sheet large \nby historical standards , and growing . This highly accommodat ive stance of  policy caused some \nconcern that inflation expectations could  become unanchored  and move higher .  \nWhile I supported the 2012 decision to specify a 2 percent objective for inflation, in \nhindsight I think it has proven to  be far more challenging than expected both as a \ncommunications mechanism and a policy guide . Too much focus is placed on achieving this \nspecific  numerical target when, in fact, inflation is likely to fluctuate around that target with \n                                                                                                                                                             \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20110126meeting.pdf , and  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20111213meeting.pdf . \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf . \n \n\n4 \n deviations that occas ionally might persist . In fact, the qualitative definition of price stability that \nguided Volcker and Greenspan  rings true today : An inflation rate that does not materially affect \nthe decisions of business or households is an inflation rate that is consistent with price stability . \nWhile I still see 2 percent as an appropriate long -run objective for policy, I think it makes sense \nto evaluate deviations from that objective in a broader context.  \n \nThe mandate  is not as simple as  a number  \nClearly, t he current inflation rate is running below 2 percent  and has been for several \nyears . But let’s put that in the context of the other leg of our dual mandate —maximum \nemployment . The unemployment rate is currently 4. 2 percent, b elow most estimates of the full -\nemplo yment unemployment rate , including that of the Congressional Budget Office (4.75  \npercent), the Survey of Professional Forecasters (4.5 percent), and the  FOMC  participant s’ \nmedian projection for the long er-run unemployment rate of 4.6 percent .  \nIn addition , FOMC participants project real GDP to grow faster over the next two years \nthan its longer -run growth rate of 1.8 percent, pushing the unemployment rate down further . \nThese projections suggest that the recent, and persistent, softness of inflation relative  to 2 percent \nhas not prevented the economy from achieving  and, arguably, overshooting maximum \nemployment . Indeed,  as recently as last year , the PCE inflation rate less food and energy prices \ncame in at 1.9 percent on a Q4 over Q4 basis. It ’s only been since February that we have seen a \nweakening in this measure of core inflation .  \nTaking the recent performance of the labor market and inflation together, I would argue \nthat the FOMC is, by historical standards, meeting the dual mandate . Yet our  policy interest rate \nremains below FOMC participants’ estimate of its longer -run level . Specifically, FOMC \n\n5 \n participants have lifted the federal funds rate —our target policy rate —four times beginning in \nDecember  2015, with the latest move in  June. With  these moves, the federal funds rate now \nstands at 1 to 1¼ percent compared to the FOMC’s median projection of the longer -run funds \nrate of 2.8 percent .  \n \nSoft inflation is not an indicator of cyclical weakness  \nSo what is driving this slowdown in inflati on? It does not appear that t he slowdown is \nassociated with a weake ning economy . As I mentioned earlier, the current unemployment rate is \nlower than many estimates of the full -employment rate , and the economy has been growing \nfaster than estimates of its l onger -run trend growth rate . These conditions might normally be \nassociated with rising inflation . That inflation has instead been falling does not , however , appear \nto reflect slack in labor markets.  \nReadings from the Kansas City Fed ’s Labor Market Conditio ns Indicators  (LMCI) \nsupport this view .3 The LMCI  looks at 24 different labor market variables and constructs two \nmeasures to describe labor market conditions : the level of activity and momentum. The level of \nactivity continues the improvement we’ve seen throughout this expansion and , except for May \nand July, it’s at its highest level since the end of the recession  and is about equal to its level at the \nend of the last expansion , suggesting tight labor market conditions. The other measure , focused \non th e momentum in the labor market , has remained at a high level , suggesting strength over the \nnear-term. Among the key variables driving improvement in the level of activity over the last six \nmonths were an increase in the quits rate and a decrease in the number  of people working part \ntime for economic reasons as a share of household employment . In other words, more people left \n                                                 \n3 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/research/indicatorsdata/lmci/2017/lmci_091317.pdf . \n \n\n6 \n their jobs for other employment and fewer people were working part -time because they couldn’t \nfind full -time jobs . These are favorable si gns, but history reminds us that they are unlikely to be \nsustainable in the longer -run. \nLabor markets also show limited slack based on behavior of the labor force participation \nrate. Demographic trends, particular ly the agi ng and retirement of the large ba by boom \ngeneration , have been exerting downward pressure on participation in the labor force  for some \ntime. However , over the last four years, the labor force participation rate has stabilized , after five \nyears of unprecedented  sharp declines that starte d in the last recession . The steady participation \nrate in recent years therefore signals that improving labor market conditions have drawn workers \nfrom the sidelines and more people are remaining in the workforce . Again, this is not a \ndevelopment  that can continue unabated . As the demographic trend reasserts itself, the labor \nforce participation rate will fall, tightening labor market conditions further .  \nAdditional evidence is based on research  by economists at the San Francisco Fed  who \nlooked at unemployment over the past 100 years.4  They estimate a hypothetical unemployment \nrate that is consistent with stable inflation and aggregate production being at its long -run level, \nbased on the relationship between inflation and labor market slack. Go ing back to 1890, they \nfind that this stable -inflation unemployment rate fluctuates in a relative ly narrow range of 4½ to \n5½ percent . With today’s unemployment rate of 4. 2 percent, we are below the low end of this \nrange.  \nIf weakness in the economy is not a  cause of soft inflation, then what is?  My best guess \nis that it is a combination of idiosyncratic shocks combined with a number of longer -run changes \nthat are holding down inflation . Examples of idiosyncratic shocks are large declines in the prices \n                                                 \n4 Regis Barnichon and Ch ristian Matthes, “The Natural Rate of Unemployment over the Past 100 Years,” Federal \nReserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter , August 14, 2017.  \n\n7 \n of telecommunications services associated with the introduction of unlimited data plans and one -\ntime downward movements in pharmaceutical prices as various drugs come off patent . Among \nthe longer -run forces holding inflation down are the lingering effects of th e appreciation of the \ndollar and decline in oil prices from 2014 . While these forces should now be abating, several  \nstructural factors —such as global competition, an agi ng population, technological change  and \ndisruptive forces in the retail sector —may persist . For example, Amazon’s purchase of Whole \nFoods and the expansion of Aldi and Lidl in the U.S. market are disrupting the grocery business \nand increas ing competitive pressure.  \nThese developments, along with the persistence of inflation below target , may also have \ncontributed to inflation expectations settling at a level somewhat less than 2 percent. If so, \nmonetary policy may be confronted with a difficult dilemma . Should policy normalization \nproceed on a gradual path to avoid overheating the economy? Or would it be more prudent to \nwait until inflation reaches 2 percent before taking further steps to tighten policy?  \n \nPatience is not always a virtue  \nRecent experience suggests inflation has not been very responsive to labor market slack . \nEven in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when unemployment reached 10 percent, the \ninflation rate excluding food and energy  prices  has fluctuated in a relatively n arrow range \n(roughly 1  percent  to 2 percent) . In my view, because of the weakness of th e relationship  \nbetween inflation and slack , it would take a considerable overheating of the economy to move \ninflation more quickly up to 2 percent . Such overheating would, in th e meantime, foster  a \nmisallocation of resources and risk financial instability as asset prices continue to climb . In \naddition, there is  a meaningful risk that if the unemployment rate fell significantly further, \n\n8 \n inflation might move considerably above 2 pe rcent, causing policymakers to tighten policy  \nabruptly . Monetary policy affects the economy with considerable lags s uch that, by the time we \nsee inflation actually moving up to 2 percent, it may be too late to prevent an undesirable \novershooting. This go -stop approach to monetary policy serves to foster uncertainty and too \noften ends in recession.  \nI also recall another time when concern about low inflation led to a delay in interest rate \nnormalization . From 2002 to 2006 as the economy recovered only gradual ly from the 2001 \neconomic recession, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to 1 percent and held it there for a year . \nIn doing so , the FOMC was responding in part to a concern that inflation was falling below \ndesired levels , with an outside risk of actual de flation . During this period , the real time data on \nthe core PCE price index fell below 1 percent . And i n May 2003, the FOMC pointed explicitly to \nthe risk of an “unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.”5  \nIn retrospect, the inflation data was subsequently revised up, and by 2005 inflation had \nrisen above 2 percent . Arguably, and although not the root cause,  the low level of interest rates in \nthis period fostered the financing of asset purchases with short -term borrowing, feeding a \nbuildup of financial imbalances and a bubble in the housing market . These excesses ended with a \nsevere financial crisis and the Great Recession .  \nTo be sure, our understanding of inflation dynamics is imperfect. It is prudent for t he \nFOMC to move cautiously and continue to monitor inflation developments to better understand \nthe causes and consequences of low inflation . In saying this, I recognize the various tradeoffs \nbetween maximum employment and price stability and their implicat ions for financial stability \n                                                 \n5 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20030506meeting.pdf . \n \n\n9 \n and sustainable economic growth . On balance, therefore, my judg ment is that we should continue \nto make gradual adjustments to normalize policy rates.  \nWaiting for solid evidence that inflation will reach 2 percent before taking  further steps to \nremove accommodation carries risks of overheating the economy, fostering financial instability, \nand perhaps putting in motion an undesirable increase in inflation . Delaying monetary policy \nadjustments c ould further tighten labor markets a nd stretch the economy’s productive capacity . \nThe resulting inflationary pressures may build slowly, though  they may be difficult to contain \nonce released .  \n \nConclusion  \nLow inflation, in itself, is not a problem in an economy that is growing and operating at \nfull employment . In such an environment, it is desirable to sustain  the economic expansion by \navoiding overheating and financial market instability. The best way to do that is to gradua lly \nadjust policy rates to more -normal settings . With  this approach,  it seems reasonable to expect \nthat inflation will gradually rise as labor markets tighten further and the effects of past oil price \ndeclines, dollar appreciation, and idiosyncratic price movements fade ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 5, 2017  \nInvesting in America’s Workforce Conference  \nAustin, Texas  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n 1 I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak here in Austin . Understanding the \ndynamics of the nation’s l abor market  plays an essential role in the work of the Federal Reserve \nand for me a s a regional Federal Reserve Bank president .  \nIn my role, I meet with business, labor  and community leaders  throughout the Federal \nReserve’s Tenth  District , which encompasses Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, \nWyoming, and portions of Missouri and New Mexico . I regularly  hear about  the importance of a \nstrong alignment between employer s’ needs and the skills available in the local labor force . The \nchallenge  is to find the best opportunities and partnerships across a wide range of organizations.  \nIn my remarks today, I’ll discuss the progress that has been made in the current economic \nexpansion toward full employment . I’ll then turn to longer -term shifts in th e types of jobs that \nare offered by employers, and how these shi fts in demand for skills have affected  workers . \nFinally, I’ll conclude my remarks with some comments on the  current stance of monetary policy \nas the Federal Reserve seeks to promote long -run s ustainable growth by foster ing maximum \nemployment and price stability.  \n \nLabor Market  Dynamics in the Current Economic Expansion  \n This is the 100th consecutive month of the ongoing economic expansion . In historical \nterms, it is the third -longest U.S. expansion on record going back to 1850 . Total employment has \nincreased on net by 17 million workers  since 2009 , which is double the number of jobs lost in the \nmost recent  recession. As employment has steadily increased, the unemp loyment rate has fallen \nfrom 10 percent in 2009 to its current level of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below \nnearly all estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that \nis estimated to prevail in the longer  run in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.  \n\n 2  While the headline variables  indicate that much of the labor market has returned to pre -\nrecession levels, other indicators reveal broader  shifts taking place . For example, the percentage \nof people participati ng in the labor force has decline d notably since the recession and has not \nmade much of a recovery . In 2007, 66 percent of the U.S . adult population (ages 16 and over) \neither had a job or were actively looking for employment . By 2015, the labor force parti cipation  \nrate had declin ed to 62 percent —this represent s a shift of 10 million people out of the labor force  \nbased on our current population . A large portion of this decline wa s due to the aging of the \npopulation , with many baby boomers reaching retirement age . However, some of the decline was \ndue to workers being discouraged about their job prospects  and no longer seeking employment . \n Over the past two years, we have seen a modest pickup in the labor force partici pation \nrate, which is  a sign of improving  labor market conditions . Research by my staff has investigated \nthis improvement to better assess  its underlying dynamics.1 While an increase in the participation \nrate may seem to suggest a surge of new workers ente ring the labor force, entries actually slowed  \nin 2016 . The increase in the participation rate was instead a result of a decline in the number of \npeople exiting the labor force . This decline, in c ombination with steady increases  in employment, \nsuggests workers are now more attached to the labor force tha n in earlier years during  the \nrecovery . As workers are matched to better  and more stable jobs , the rotating  of workers in and \nout of employment and in and out of the labor force s lows . An additional contributing factor was \nthat the group experiencing the largest slowing  in labor force exits was the population aged 55 \nand older . This suggests that for older workers, the reduction in exits may indicate that some \nworkers were delaying  retirement decisions.  \n                                                        \n1 Tüzemen, Didem and Jonathan Willis. 2016. “ What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor \nForce Participation ?” The Macro Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, November.   \n \n\n 3  \nJob Polarization  \n Despite  overall improvements in employment and the participation rate, we know there \nare still segments of the working -age population that have not experienced as much of a recovery  \nas we would like . This group has  been impacted by  longer -term trend s. In particular, workers in \nmiddle -skill jobs have seen the demand for their skills steadily decline . For decades, these jobs \nwere the gateway to the middle class.  \nThe decline in middle -skill jobs is the result of a number of sweeping changes affecting \nthe economy . If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle -skill jobs that were much more \nprevalent than we see today include as sembly -line manufacturing jobs and clerical and \nadministrative positions. In 1983, nearl y 60 percent of all jobs were in middle -skill occupations.2  \nToday, that employment share has declined to 4 3 percent . Based on current employment levels, \nthis shift would be equivalent to moving 22 million jobs away from middle -skill occupations .  \nMany  of the employment opportunities in our economy have shifted toward high -skill \njobs, which are jobs that typically require a college education . Since 1983, the share of high -skill \njobs has increased from 26 percent to 39 percent .  \nWhat is perhaps more surp rising is what we have seen at the other end of the spectrum . \nThe share of employment for low -skill jobs has also increased, from 15 percent to 18 percent . \nWorkers in these jobs typically have little formal education beyond high school, and they work \nin oc cupations that are service -oriented and cannot be easily automated, such as food \npreparation, cleaning and  security services .  \n                                                        \n2 Tüzemen, Di dem and Jonathan Willis. 2013. “ The Vanishing Middle: Job Polarization and \nWorkers’ Response to the Decline in Middle -Skill Job s.” Economic Review , Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City , first quarter , pp. 5 -32.  \n \n\n 4 This shift of employment toward both high - and low -skill jobs and away from middle -\nskill positions  has been labeled “job polariz ation.”   \n \nJob Polarization: Gender and Race  \n As a result of this development , the current generation entering the workforce finds a \nvery different landscape than the  labor market of  the 1980s . How have new entrants to the labor \nforce adapted over time to be better prepared for the current labor market?   Understanding these \ntrends is particularly relevant to those of you  focused on developing today’s workforce .  \nI’d like to use two demographic lenses  to illustrate  how the population is adapting to job \npolar ization —looking first at shifts by gender and second at shifts by race.  \nOver  the past three decades, both men and women experienced declines  in the shares of  \nemployment in middle -skill jobs, but for different reasons. For women, t he main losses in the \nshare of middle -skill employment were in  office and administrative occupations, likely related to \nthe replacement of many secretarial and clerical jobs with desktop computing. For men, m ajor \nlosses were  in production occupations, likely related to the decline in employment in the \nmanufacturing industry.  \nWomen and men  responded very differently to these developments .  \nFor women, the decline was accompanied by an almost equally large increase in  the share \nof high-skill job s, particularly in  managerial, professional and technical occupations, such as \nengineering, finance, management  and medicine. Based on the shift, women today occupy a \nlarger portion of high -skill jobs compared to the 1980s.  \nFor men, the shift away from middle -skill occupati ons led to almost equal increases in \nthe shares of employment in both low- and high -skill occupations. Accordingly , a larger portion \n\n 5 of low-skill occupations , which are primarily service jobs, are held by men today as compared to \nthe 1980s.   \nGender differe nces in job shifts line up closely with gender differences in educational \nattainment. While levels of attainment increased for both male and female workers  over the past \nthree decades , the change was more pronounced for women. The strong shift toward high -skill \njobs for women  was associated with  a large increase in the share of women with a bachelor’s \ndegree or higher. Educational attainment of men has risen more modestly, in line with the \nsmaller shift of male employment toward high -skill jobs.   \n  While we see very different response s to job polarization between  men and women, the \nresponse s across racial groups are more similar, with difference s predominately reflecting \nhistorical  disparities in levels of educational attainment .  \nTo illustrate the response s to job polarization by race , I will fo cus on two groups, African \nAmerican and Caucasian workers , who together account for 9 0 percent of employment in the \nUnited States.  First, however, let me describe the terms and information I’ m using . The statistics \ncome from the Current Population Survey  (CPS) , which is the survey used to construct the \nunemployment rate . The terms I’ll use for race also require clarification . The term s African \nAmerican and black are used synonymously in  the official data collection and so I will use the \nterm black to mean African American and white to mean Caucasian . Finally, I’d like to note that \nin this survey, Hispanic workers account for 16 percent of total employment, and many  likely \nself-identify a s white when identifying  their race  in the survey . They have the option of \nidentifying as Hispanic in a separate question on ethnicity.  \n Over the past two decades, both white and black workers have experienced similar shifts \nin job opportunities consisten t with job polarization . Both groups experienced a significant \n\n 6 decline in the employment  share of middle skill jobs .3 And e mployment for both populations \nshifted toward high - and low -skill jobs, with a stronger shift toward high -skill jobs.  \n While employme nt shifts were similar, white workers have had a consistently larger \nshare of employment in high -skill occupations . In 201 7, 40 percent of white workers were \nemploy ed in high -skill jobs, relative to 30 percent of black workers . Both populations have a \nsimilar share of workers in middle -skill jobs —approximately 45 percent . This implies that there \nis a larger share of black workers in low -skill jobs than white workers:  24 percent of black \nworkers and 17 percent of white workers.  \n As employers have increas ed the share of high -skill jobs, workers have responded by \nobtaining higher levels of education than previous generations . The share of workers with a \nbachelor’s degree ha s increased by approximately  10 percentage points over the past two \ndecades for both black and white workers . But underlying this shift in educational attainment, a \npersistent education gap exists between black and white populations . In 201 7, 36 percent of \nwhite workers had a bachelor’s degree, relative to 2 8 percent of black workers.  \n The difference in  education al attainment  is very important . It is increasingly challenging \nfor a worker to obtain a high -skill job without having a bachelor’s degree . During the past 20 \nyears, workers with a high school diploma or some college education have experienced a \ndecrease in the likelihood of obtaining one of these jobs .  \nOf particular concern is the divergence in opportunities between those with a bachelor’s \ndegree and those with some college  education . For those with a college degree, the opportunit ies \nare clear: high -skill jobs . However, individuals with some college education  or an a ssociate ’s \n                                                        \n3Kansas City Fed  Economic Research Department. 2017 . “Assessing Differences in Labor \nMarket Outcomes Across Race, Age, and Educational Attainment .” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, Research Working Paper no. 17 -03, April.  \n\n 7 degree  are struggling to find good employment opportunities . Especially in the case of  black \nworkers, individuals with some college education are increasingly ending up in low -skill jobs.  \n The workforce development challenge  is steadily  shifting to how to best equip workers \nwith the skills in demand by employers . More than 60 percent of wor kers do not have a college \ndegree, and are thus most likely competing for middle -skill jobs . Employers will no longer \nsimply welcome a young worker with a high school diploma and say, “I’ll train you ,” but are  \nmore likely to ask, “What skills do you alread y have?” Young people  today who do not see \ncollege as their best path forward need to have better awareness and opportunities for vocational \ntraining  and post -high-school certification and training programs in areas such as skilled trades, \nhealthcare, and coding . With improved training, they will be better equipped for today’s middle -\nskill jobs, which despite declines,  still account for 4 3 percent of all jobs.  \n The Federal Reserve System is actively involved in a range of activities t o promote  better \noutcomes for workers . We are engaged in research, roundtable conversations with industry and \nlabor leaders, conferences like this one, and publications, such as our recent publication \nexploring workforce development policies for the 21st century.  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy  \n As the Federal Reserve determine s the appropriate settings for the nation’s monetary \npolicy, it must weigh a variety of economic factors, including the labor market trends that I have \ndescribed today . In the short run, I look a cross a wide range of business sectors and assess their \nperformance , monitoring their demand for workers in a tightening labor market and their capital \ninvestment plans . In the longer run, I evaluate trends such as job polarization and an aging \nworkforce , and consider what those structural forces imply for the Federal Reserve’s goals of \n\n 8 maximum employment and price stability . These are challenging economic factors  to evaluate, \nwith different  forces typically pushing the economy in different directions at the same time . \nMonetary  policy is a blunt tool with limited ability to influence any specific  segment of the \neconomy . It is most adept at addressing factors related to the business cycle and least adept at \naddressing  the longer -run trends such as  job polarization and an aging workforce.  \n For monetary policy makers, the key question centers on the appropriate level of \naccommodation , at this stage of the economic expansion , to best foster long -run sustainable \ngrowth . At the most recent  Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC ) meeting, the Committee \nannounced plans to initiate its balance sheet normalization program in October . Large -scale asset \npurchases (LSAPs), better known as quantitative easing, or QE, transformed the size and \ncomposition of the Fed’s balance sheet from less than $1 trillion in mid -2008  to approximately \n$4.5 trillion today . This unconventional policy was implemented because the Federal Reserve’s \nconventional policy tool, the feder al funds target rate , had been lowered to zero in December \n2008 , and the Federal Reserve determined that additional measures were warranted . Beginning \nthis month, the FOMC plans to gradually reduce its securities holdings by decreasing \nreinvestment of the principal payments received from maturing securities . This gradual reduction \nin securities holdings will continue “until the FOMC judges that the Federal Reserve is holding \nno more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effe ctively.”  \nIn regard to interest rates, the FOMC has maintained a very accommodative stance of \npolicy up to this point . The target range for the federal funds rate was set at the zero lower bound \nfrom 2008 until the end of 2015 . Starting in December 2015, t he federal funds rate has been \nraised a total of four times to its  current target range of 1 to 1 ¼ percent . During this first phase of \n\n 9 monetary policy normalization, economic growth has remained above trend and the \nunemployment rate has declined from 5.0 p ercent to 4.4 percent.   \nLooking forward, policymakers face the challenge of setting the appropriate path of \ninterest rates to promote the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability .  \nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate a djustments will be needed to \nmove the federal fund s rate toward its longer -run level . With an economy growing at an above -\ntrend rate and unemployment at a low level , postponing the removal of accommodation poses \nrisks to sustainable growth and financial st ability . At this stage of the expansion, it is appropriate \nto move cautiously . But waiting too long  risks more aggressive moves , which , history shows can \ninvite  prospects of recession . And a continuation of current levels of accommodation risks \nsimilar distortions in capital allocation toward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, \nendeavors that could result in financial imbalances.  \nMoving inte rest rates at a gradual pace toward a level consistent with longer -run growth \nis the best step to help pro mote a continuation of the economic expansion . For the Federal \nReserve, such efforts are the most likely course, in my view, to meet our long -run goals of \nmaximum employment and price stability . And by doing so, we can best foster conditions to \nsupport wor kforce development efforts to invest in workers and build a stronger econom y."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeptember 27, 2017  \nBanking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representative s. \n \n\n1 \n  \nThank you for the opportunity to join you  today . I am pleased to host  this important event \nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.    \nThe Kansas City Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks  that, along with the \ngovernment agency called the Federal Rese rve Board in Washington, D.C., comp rise the Federal \nReserve System, our nation’s central bank.  The work of t he Federal Reserve can be summarized \nin three primary mission areas : monetary policy , financial institu tion supervision and regulation, \nand payment services. And taken together, these activities are intended to maintain economic and \nfinancial stability as important conditions for the health of the U.S. economy and the prosperity \nof the Am erican public . As a regional Federal Reserve president, I oversee the Kansas City Fed’s \nwork in these areas across a seven -state region with branch offices in Oma ha, Denver  and \nOklahoma City.  \nIn my remarks today , I will offer a brief perspective on the pe rformance of the nation’s \neconomy  and the current stance of the Fede ral Reserve’s monetary policy. I’ll also discuss  the \nimportance of acces s to credit in creating broadly shared economic growth , concluding with \nhighlights of how these issues affect communities, including minority communities . Before \ncontinuing, I must tell you that the views I share are wholly my own.  \n \nThe U.S. e conomy  \nThe U.S. economy  is in reasonably good sha pe, with growth reported to have increased \n3.0 percent in the second quart er of 2017, a rebound from its weak first quarter pace. Consumers \ncontinue to be the main force behind this expansion , with consumption accou nting for more than \ntwo-thirds  of the nation’s  gross domestic product  (GDP ). We also  have  recently seen business \n\n2 \n investment pick up, experiencing the strongest growth rate since mid -2014. Looking forward, \nwith accommodative financial conditions, elevated levels of consumer and business confidence, \nand a brighter global growth outlook, I  expect the economy will continue  to grow over the next \nfew years with low unemployment a nd low inflation.  \nLabor market s have continued to strengthen with  total employment increas ing on net by \n17 million workers, which is double the number of jo bs lost in the last recession. As employment  \nhas steadily increased, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to its  current \nlevel of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below nearly all estimates of the natural rate \nof unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that is estimated to prevail in the longer \nrun in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.  \nAt last week’s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting, the committee decided \nto maintain the current level of short -term interest rates , continui ng an accommodative polic y \nstance.  Another important action was taken , however. The c ommittee announced it would initiate \nthe process of normalizing its balance sheet.   \nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate adjustments will be needed to \nmove the federal fund s rate toward its longer -run level. With an economy growing at an above -\ntrend rate and unemployment below most estimates of its long -run level, continuing to remove  \naccommodation will be important for long-run sustainable growth and financial stability.   \n \nAccess to credit  \nAppropriate monetary policy settings serve an important role in sust aining growth in the \nlong run. But there are many other important factors that determine the nation’s economic \ngrowth , including  a healthy and prod uctive labor market, inn ovation  and access to capital . I \n\n3 \n would like to turn to the issue of the availability of credit  and its implications for the economic \nprospects  of households and businesses .  \nThe banking system in the United States has long been an essential source of cap ital for \nthe nation’s economy. Here i n the Tenth Federal Reserve District , we have a large number of \ncommunity banks.  \nHaving adapted over the years to significant economic and regulatory changes, as well as \ntechnology disruption, the community bank busine ss model has retained its unique focus on \nrelationship banking. These banks, their owners and the people who work for them are generally \nmembers of the communities they serve . The relationships are long -term and the incentives of \nthe bank and the borrower are well aligned . \nWhether the community is a  small rural town or an urban neighborhood —this business \nmodel features local bankers who are immersed in their communities, understand the  economic \ndrivers of the ir communities and often serve as leaders in their communities. Those of you who \nare bankers here today recognize t his critically important role , and your financial institutions  \nhave  recognize d that this requires diverse staff reflecting the communities they serve .    \nHowever, diverse tale nt in banks is just one aspect of serving a community from a base of \nundersta nding and personal engagement. Diverse ownership of banks is also important . Yet, \nthere are very few minority -owned banks in the United States  today and their numbers are \ndeclining . Over the 10 -year span since 2006 to the end of 2016, the total number of FDIC -\ninsured minority depository institutions has declined from 194 to 157.1 Within this category, the \nnumber of institutions classified as Native American or Alaskan Nativ e American has held \n                                                           \n1 Data Source: FDIC -Insured Minority Depository Institutions data, year -end totals.  Accessible via: \nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/minority/mdi.html . Minority status is defined either by the \nconcentration of ownership status among a certain minority group or the concentration of board membership by a \nminority group of an institution that serves primarily that minority group.  \n\n4 \n relatively steady , falling from 20 to 18 , while the number of Hispanic American banks has \ndropped from 48 to 39. The sharpest decline has been in  the number of African A merican banks , \nwhich  has fallen  by almost half to 24 institutions, according to FDIC data.  \n \nCommunity ban k trends  \nThese trends are not limited to minority banks , however. The number of banks in the \nUnited States has dropped considerably from a little more than14,000 in 1982 , according to \nFDIC data,  to around 5,000 today , and much of this decline has been in banks with less than \n$100 million in assets.  How these consolidation trends affect access to credit is important to \nunderstand.  \nYou have only to read today’s news to recognize the  value of a local bank . It was recently  \nreported  that Bank of America, the second largest lender in the United States, has closed nearly \n1,600 branches since the financial crisis . These closures p rimarily impact  rural areas . While \nsome branches were sold to smaller lenders, others were simply closed with customers directed \nto offices dozens of miles away.2 On the other hand , at about the same time this story was \nmaking headlines, another article highlighted efforts to save a communit y hospital in the \nMissouri boot heel region and the involvemen t of a community bank in providing its financing .  \nAs the banker explained: “We knew what would happen to this community if that hospital \nclosed.”3  \n                                                           \n2 https://www.wsj.com/articles/how -bank -of-america -ditched -1-597-branches -across -the-u-s-1505646000    \n3 http://kcur.org/post/how -one-missouri -town -saved -its-hospital -financial -collapse#stream/0  \n\n5 \n  \nThe h istoric role of minority -owned b anks  \nThroughout the history of our financial system, the inability to access credit often spurred \nthe establishment of a local bank. These banks often proved to be innovative lenders that \nconsidered the unique characteristics of local communities . \nMinority -owned banks emerged for the same fundamental reason , and their history tells \nan important story  about access to the financial system , and understanding history is so important \nto understanding how to solve the challenges we face today.  \nIn the Tenth Federal Reserve District, Centinel Bank of Taos, N.M. , is a great example.  \nCentinel is generally bel ieved to be the first mainland U.S.-based Hispanic bank. If you were \nhere last year, you remember one of our speakers was Centinel’s chair and CEO, Rebeca Romero \nRainey. In 1959, Rebeca’s grandfather, who had serve d in the military and then earned a law \ndegree, was denied a $50 loan  to purchase office furniture. At that point , he vowed to create a \nbank that would provide equal access to  credit for  everyone . After gathering support from about \n300 investors, the bank opened for business  in 1969 .  \nMore recently, the first bank owned or controlled by a Native American tribe was created \nin 1987 when the Blackfeet Tribe of northwestern Montana took over a failed bank in the city of \nBrowning, Mont. Blackfeet National Bank l ater became Native America Bank, NA .  \nWith some of the earliest African American banks , loans were primarily to mutual aid \nsocieties and entrepreneurs.4 The number of African American -owned banks increased \nsubstantially after 1900 and, between 1900 and 1914, the number of African American business \nenterprises doubled, with more substantial increases in some business segments, particularly \n                                                           \n4 Ammons, Lia. “The Evolution of Black -Owned Banks in the United States Between the 1880s and the 1990s.” \nJournal of Bla ck Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Mar. 1996).  \n\n6 \n retail merchants .5 This was a notable expansion of opportunity compared to the late 1800s when \nthe primary occupations held by African Americans were blacksmith, tailor, barber and similar \njobs.6 \nThe first banks with African American ownership opened during the Reconstruc tion \nperiod in our country . The first to receive a charter was The Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain \nof the United Order of True Reformers.  In 1890, the b ank’s founder , William Washington \nBrowne , explained his goal: “The True Reformers sounds like reforme rs of character, but we are \nhunting for people who are already reformed. The church …has the other kind of reformation in \nhand; mine is financial reform. I want to go forward reforming our people financially. We are \nthrowing away money enough to buy this c ountry.”   \nBrowne’s bank, and the others that  soon followed his model, sought to provide services \nto customers who  had suffered in many ways , including being exploited financially. Prior to that \nbank’s creation, the government had established the Freedman’ s Bank in 1865 specifically to \nserve the nation’s African American population. Although the intentions were honorable and \nbranches were opened in several states in an attempt to con nect to local populations, the b ank’s \nleadership was not aligned with the n eeds of its communities. Instead, corruption and high -risk \ninvestments made with bank deposits resulted in its failure (despite the best efforts of Frederick \nDouglass , who had fought to save the institution after the damage had been done). In this era \nbefore deposit insurance, the collapse took with it the life savings of 61,000 savers who were \nstruggling to become established in the United States.  \nBrowne’s life story is itself very much about the ability to overcome challenges and is as \ninspirational as a ny in American history. At age of 13, he escape d slavery and  eventually joined \n                                                           \n5 Meier, August. “Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington.” Phylon. Clark Atlanta \nUniversity. Vol. 23, No. 3. (Q3, 1962).  \n6 Ibid.  \n\n7 \n the Union Army. After gaining an education in Wisconsin, he returned to the south as a teacher \nand served as a minister. Influenced by his experiences, Browne established the Gr and Fountain \nof the United Order of True Reformers, a fraternal organization with the stated goals of taking \ncare of the sick, burying the dead and providing other assist ance.   \nBrowne had not necessarily sought to establish a bank to achieve personal goals. Instead \nthe bank was created in response to the needs of his organization, which reflected the needs of \nthe community. A Virginia chapter had been unable to organize because of difficulties safely \nstoring its treasury of about $100. Denied access to a t raditional banking institution, the group \nhad to instead rely on the safe of a local storekeeper, which had proven problematic. The chapter \nwas ready to give up, but Browne encouraged them forward. Creating a bank provided a degree \nof security for the orga nization by meeting a very fundamental financial services need —in this \ncase, the bank was literally a  response to the need for a safe place to store funds —but Browne \nknew, as we know today, that banks also foster opportunities. It was  to be an economic win/win \n—a place to pool the resources of savers to meet the needs of borrowers.  \nIn the words of one of Browne’s associates: “We mean to encourage … people to get \nhomes and means upon which they may independently subsist.”   \nBrowne kept his word. Throughout the panic of 1893 , which saw nearly 600 banks \nnationwide either fail or suspend operations, it is recorded that Browne’s bank was the only bank \nin the entire state of Virginia that co ntinued paying out all checks. During the crisis, at  least one \nlocal public school was able to obtain the funds necessary for paying salaries from Browne’s \nbank after being denied by  other financial institutions. Similarly, the bank loaned money to the \nCity of Richmond in the early 1900s when the city was a lso unable to obtain funds from other \nsources. This is the story of community banks —saving the local hospital in Missouri today, \n\n8 \n fundin g Hispanic customers in 1969, and  saving the city o f Richmond in the early 1900s. An \ninstitution that is local enough to understand and meet the credit needs of a community \ndetermines whether that community thrives or withers.  \n \nConclusion  \nThis history is a reminder of the importance of access to credit and the role it plays in the \nprosperity of households a nd the vitality o f businesses. In the words of one of Browne’ s \ncontemporaries , “Banks are the life blood of trade and progress, whenever they may be \nestablished.”7 It is as  true today as it was in 1890. And the health and diversity of our banking \nsystem remains key  to the promise of delivering broad -based economic gains for thousands of \ncommunities  and for the millions of households and businesses that they serve . \n                                                           \n7 Burrell, William Patrick and Johnson, D.E.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 12, 2017  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Forum  \nDenver, Colo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n                                                           \n1 A. Lee Smith and Timothy Todd assisted in preparing these remarks.  \n\n1 \n I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you today. The Denver Branch of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of  Kansas City was created to serve as the central bank’s connection to \nportions of the Mountain West that are within the Tenth Federal Reserve Distric t – Colorado, \nWyoming and n orthern New Mexico. To help us fulfill that responsibility, we rely heavily on o ur \ncontacts from within this community, including many joining us here  today , as well as others \nacross  the region to provide us with insight on emerging financial and economic conditions. The \ncontributions by these individuals are extremely important to me  in my responsibilities \nrepresenting this  region in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations , and I want to \nexpress my thanks to those who provide this valuable input . \nToday, I would like to talk  about a topic that has been receiving much attenti on — the \nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet  – and what it means when policymakers talk about its \nnormalization  and ceasing reinvestments . Large scale asset purchases  (LSAPs) , better known as \nquantitative easing , or QE, have transformed the Fed’s balance sheet  and sparked active debate, \nboth within and outside the FOMC, about the costs and benefits of this unconventional monetary \npolicy  that was deployed during and after the financial crisis . Given the juncture we are at in the \nprocess of normali zing monetary policy , now is a useful time to revisit these issues  based on \nwhat we know — and what we have yet to learn — about using the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet in this way . \nBecause the majority of my regional contacts are neither central bankers nor economists, \nI have focused my remarks today on providing a basic foundation for understanding this headline \nissue . I’ll begin my comments with a primer on the nature of the Federal Reserve’s assets and \nliabilities . Then, I will describe how the Fed’s balan ce sheet changed starting in 2008 based on \nFOMC decisions to make credit easier and provide more accommodation to the economy . \n\n2 \n Finally, I’ll discuss some of the  key issues policymakers are considering today and what I see as \npossible implications.  \n \nInside the N umbers  \nUnderstanding the Fed’s balance sheet requires some understanding of t he Federal \nReserve System structure designed by Congress in 1913 . The Fed  consists of a government \nagency in Washington, D.C.  known as The Federal Reserve Board o f Governors,  and 12 \nseparately -incorporated, nationally -chartered Reserve Banks. When we talk about the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet today , we are actually referring to the combined  balance sheets of the 12 \nindividual regional Federal Reserve Banks .  \nThis combined  balance sheet is audited annually by an independent  audit firm, currently \nKPMG , and is made available to the public on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem’s website: www.federalreserve.gov . Also  on this website are unaudited quarterly \nfinancial report s that include the combined  balance sheet. And each week, generally late on \nThursday afternoon, changes to the Fed’s balance sheet are published on the website in the H.4.1 \nstatistical release,  known as “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances .”  \nThe current  $4.5 trillion balance sheet  certainly stands out . The Fed’s assets primarily \ninclude a securities portfolio  of System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings . The Fed’s \nliabilities primarily consist of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and depository institution \ndeposits.2 \n                                                           \n2 Additional details on the composition of assets and liabilities in the Fed’s combined balance sheet at March 31, \n2017 can be found in the unaudited quarterly financial report, which is available online at: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/quarterly -report -20170331.pdf  \n \n\n3 \n What is unique about the Fed’s  balance sheet is its ability to  expand  and shrink as needed \nto facilitate the conduct of  monetary policy  in response to economic conditions . Conventional \nmonetary policy involves the buying and selling of securities. At the conclusion of each FOMC \npolicy meeting, a directive is communicated to the Federal Reserve’s open market desk, which is \nbased at the New  York Fed. This directive also is communicated publicly in the FOMC’s post \nmeeting statement, which is heavily covered by the financial press.  \nIn the case of a conventional policy tightening, the Fed’s open market desk will sell \nsecurities . The funds recei ved from those sales will then be removed from circulation, reducing \nthe overall amount of available reserves  in the banking system . The resulting smaller pool of \nreserves from which to lend  increa ses the cost of borrowing – or to put it more clearly,  interest \nrates move higher . If the FOMC decides to ease monetary policy, this process would work in \nreverse, with the Fed buying securities.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has grown considerably over the past decade. At \nnearly  $4.5 trillion, it represents almost 25 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP)  compared to  just 6 percent of GDP in 2007 . Liabilities of the Fed at that time were \ncomprised almost entirely of currency in circulation with reserves averaging about  $10 billion.  \nToday , reserves total more than $2 trillion. These reserves were created  by the Fed  to finance the \npurchase  of long -term Treasury and agency debt during multiple rounds of  large scale asset \npurchases , also known as  LSAPs . Although  the Fed stopped its program of expansionary bond \npurchases in October 2014, it has continued to reinvest the returns it receives from the maturing \nsecurities. As  a result, the current size and composition of the balance sheet has remained \nunchanged for mo re than 2 ½ years.  \n \n\n4 \n The Shift to Unconventional P olicy  \nIn the pre -crisis monetary policy framework, the Fed adjusted its holdings of Treasury \nsecurities t o affect the amount of reserves in the banking system  through the process I explained \nearlier . Due to the low level of  excess  reserves banks held  at that time , modest adjustments in the \nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet influenced the federal funds rate , which is the rate that banks lend \ntheir reserves to each other overnight . When t his was the key mechanism  to influence monetary \npolicy , open market operations required a relatively small balance sheet  with assets  comprised \nprimarily of short -term Treasuries. However, this pre -crisis framework was challenged during \nthe global  financial crisis.  \nIn December 2008 , the economic outlook deteriorated to the point that the FOMC voted \nto target a federal funds rate of zero to 25 basis points. Despite these extraordinarily low short -\nterm interest rates, longer -term rates for consumers and firms remained well above zero.  The \ncombination of weakening economic conditions and effectively constrained short -term policy \nrates led the Federal Reserve to pursue a strategy of LSAPs  to further ease monetary conditions .  \nBy the nature of the fed funds rate, traditional monetary policy has a more substantial  \ninfluence on the short -term securities market , providing a base from which yields extend across \nthe curve . LSAPs were designed explicitly to depress yields on longer -term securities through \nthe purchase of  large quantities of assets. The initial round of purchases, which commenced in \nDecember of 2008, primarily targeted mortgage -related securities in an effort to put downward \npressure on mortgage rates and to help stabilize housing and financial markets. Ho wever, \nsubsequent rounds of asset purchases included longer -term Treasury securities in a bid to ease \nbroader financial conditions and foster overall economic activity. In these latter rounds of \npurchases, LSAPs evolved from a crisis response mechanism to a more general policy tool used \n\n5 \n to promote the Federal Reserve’s mandate  to foster maximum sustainable employment and stable \nprices.  \n \nJudging t he Benefits and C osts of LSAPs  \nThe use of the balance sheet as an instrument of monetary policy in this manner marked \nan important shift . With no experience on which to rely, the FOMC’s decision to undertake \nbalance sheet po licy was not taken lightly. Arguments in favor of expanding the balance sheet \nfocused on the notion that by depressing longer -term yields and e asing credit conditions , the \nFOMC could provide some stimulus to support the economic recovery. On the other hand , it was \nrecognized that there could be  nontrivial costs associated with providing this experimental \nstimulus . These costs stemmed from the uni ntended consequences LSAPs could have on the \neconomy and financial markets , and the complexities associated with employing and exiting \nfrom such unconventional policy . Ultimately, the FOMC deemed the benefits would outweigh \nthe costs.  \nWhile i t is likely premature to fully judge the  extent of the benefits versus the  costs of \nLSAPs , a consensus of research does suggest  that the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet has depressed longer -term interest rates . This has eased financial conditions ,3 although \nsome of this effect assumes that the Federal Reserve will hold the assets it purchase d for a \nprolonged period of time  independent of economic conditions.   \nResearch by my staff suggests that the Fed’s asset holdings continue to place downward \npress ure on longer -term rates today  – as they were intended to do .4 This effect , however, has the \n                                                           \n3 See, for example , Taeyoung Doh,  “The Efficacy of Large -Scale Asset Purchases at th e Zero Lower Bound ,” \nEconomic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Q2 2010. Also,  the Macro Bulletin cited below.  \n4 See, for example , Troy Davig and A. Lee Smith , “Forecasting the Stance of Monetary Policy under Balance Sheet \nAdjustments ,” Macro Bulle tin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 10, 2017.  \n\n6 \n potential to introduce new threats to economic stability going forward . Holding long-term rates  \nbelow the level that they  might otherwise move to  naturally , amidst improving economic \nfundamentals , risks creating financial imbalances . History reminds us  that it may be difficult to \ndetect such imbalances in real time and that they can only become apparent well after they \nmanifest . Looking across a spectrum of a sset classes today, from real estate to equities to \ncorporate bonds, there is reason to remain vigilant despite the apparent tranquility in financial \nmarkets.  \nIn addition to the potential costs associated with using LSAPs, some costs have becom e \nincreasing ly visible as the FOMC begins  to normalize monetary policy. For example, a large \nbalance sheet has made monetary policy more complex today than it was a decade ago. From an \noperational  standpoint, the Federal Reserve has had to rethink its traditional approach to \ntargeting  the federal funds rate in an environment of abundan t reserves. In the process, the \nFederal Reserve has engaged an expanded set of counterparties and thereby e xpanded its \nfootprint in certain financial markets.  \nFrom a communications persp ective, the existence of multiple policy instruments has \nmade explaining  the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy to the public more complicated. With the \nintroduction of LSAPs , the FOMC’s post -meeting statements became lengthier .5 These \nstatements now include not only the traditional policy directive and relevant details regarding \neconomic conditions a nd the outlook, but also address securities holdings acquired under the \nLSAPs.  \n \n                                                           \n5 The first post -meeting  public  statement , issued in 1994 , was a total of about 100 words. The length of policy \nstatements in recent years has increased to average more than 600  words.  \n\n7 \n The Process of Normalizing the Balance S heet \nAt its June 2017 meeting , the FOMC outlined its planned approach for reducing its \nTreasury and agency portfolio. Once initiated, the Committee intends to limit the pace at which \nthe FOMC’s portfolio is unwound by gradually decreasing its reinvestment of the principal \npayments received from maturing securities. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only \nto the extent that they exceed preset rising caps , allowing the balance sheet to shrink  in a slow \nand largely predictable manner.  \nWhile the “how” of balance sheet normalization has be en largely established, the “when” \nand the “how much” remain to be determined . In terms of “when ,” the FOMC has indicated it \nexpects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided the \neconomy evolves broadly as anticipated . One reason I favor shrinking the balance sheet sooner \nrather than later is the observed  disconnect between short -term rates and long -term rates. Despite \nfour 25 -basis -point increases in the target funds rate since December of 2015, longer -term yields \nrema in little changed.  \nAccording to the FOMC’s Summar y of Economic Projections (SEP), the median forecast \nin the so -called “dot plot” anticipates another 25 -basis -point increase in the funds rate this year \nand three more increases next year. If further increa ses in the target funds rate fail to transmit to \nlonger -term yields, the yield curve could flatten further . Such a rate environment can distort \ninvestment decisions. To the extent that reducing our asset holdings will apply some modest \nupward pressure to l onger -term interest rates, balance sheet normalization could promote the  \nmore  typical transmission of short -term interest rate changes throughout the yield curve and \nensure that all components of policy accommodation are removed in a gradual manner.  \n\n8 \n The qu estion of “how much” the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink also is an important \naspect of policy normalization , but has yet to be determined . The FOMC has said that it \nanticipates reducing the amount of reserves, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in \nrecent years but larger than before the financial crisis . The ultimate size of the Fed’s balance \nsheet will be influenced by a number of factors, including the public’s demand for currency in \ncirculation, decisions the FOMC makes about its securiti es portfolio and its long -run operating \nframework , and  the economy . To improve the public’s understanding of balance sheet \ndevelopments, t he Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s public website was  recently updated \nwith projections for the long -run size of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet .6   \n \nGauging the Implications of Balance Sheet N ormalization  \nI support th e FOMC’s approach to balance sheet normalization and favor initiating the \nprocess in the near future , although  I would  have  prefer red to be starting the process with a \nsmaller balance sheet than exists today . As a voting member of the FOMC  in 2013 , I voted \nagainst  the continuation of the asset purchase program known popularly as QE III. By then, \nfinancial markets were stable and the economy was growing . My concerns about the expansion \nof the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions  centered on many of the issues I’ve discussed \ntoday. In my view, the possible unintended side effects of the ongoing asset purchases posed \nrisks to economic and financial s tability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future \nmonetary policy. I remain reluctant to advocate for the use of LSAP s in the future  outside \nextraordinary circumstances . \n                                                           \n6 http://libert ystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/07/just -released -updated -soma -portfolio -and-income -\nprojections.html  \n\n9 \n It could prove to be the case that my concerns were misplaced . Certainly today’s \nfinancial markets are calm  and labor markets remain robust . Recent “stress tests” suggest that the \nlargest U.S. banks are healthy for the most part . I hope such conditions point to a path of \ncontinued, stable economic growth .  \nYet, my experience reminds me that imbalances can develop in sectors outside the lens of \nregulators and , as we witnessed a decade ago , can  unwind with little warning . The current \ncombination of asset valuations —influenced  in part by LSAPs — together with low levels of \nimplied  volatility in equity and bond markets , could be signal ing broader complacency in \nfinancial markets. For example, the failure of longer -term rates to move up with short -term rates \nduring this normalization cycle illustrates the risk for a disruptive repric ing of assets as markets \nadjust to a more normal policy stance. The potential for such disruption highlights the essential \nnature of ensuring that our largest banks are indeed  well capitalized  and able to withstand the \nrepercussions of a financial shock . Although often noted as higher than a decade ago , equity \ncapital levels in these banks remain well below levels held by the nation’s community banks .7  \nAssuring s trong  capital is particularly critical in light of focused efforts to ease various \nregulatory mechanisms that are designed to off set the systemic risk these large banks pose to the \nnation’s economy . \nAt the same time, the FOMC faces the unprecedented task of normalizing multiple \ndimensions of policy without impeding the economic expansion . Moving too fast could \nexcessively tighten financial conditions and slow the economy. Moving too slow ly could cause a \nrelatively tight labor market to become further stretched beyond what is sustainable in the \nlonger -run. In either case, history shows tha t a policy mistake  can invite a recession .  \n \n                                                           \n7 FDIC Global Capital Index: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/global.html  \n\n10 \n Conclusion  \nEven as short -term interest rates rise, monetary policy remains accommodative . Making \nadjustments to the Fed’s sizeable balance sheet is a necessary  but unfamiliar  part of the FOMC’s \npolicy process . As a result, the Committee has adopted a gradual  approach to its policy \nnormalization  approach . Removing accommodation in small doses , consistent with the pace of \nimprovement in the economy’s fundamentals , should allow Fed policy to evolve from fueling an \neconomic expansion to  sustain ing it."

And its namesake, \nHenry Bloch , serves as a worthy example of the school ’s mission  to develop purposeful, \nentrepreneurial and innovative leaders to meet changing global demands, and advance \nknowledge and practice throug h excellent teaching, scholarship, outreach and service.  \nCongratulations. You’ve earned a college degree , and t hat achievement alone gives you \nan advantageous seat at the table of the U.S. economy . By completing a bachelor ’s or graduate \ndegree, your chances of getting a job are pretty good . Last year, the unemployment rate for \ncollege graduates was only 2.5 percent – it’s more than twice that rate for those with out that level \nof education . 1 And not only are your chances good for landing a job , it’s l ikely that you’ll be \npaid more for it . The median income of a worker  with a Bachelor’s or higher degree is more than \n40 percent above the overall median  income .2  \nThose facts paint a very favorable picture of your future .  Unfortunately , the advantages \nyou have today  are not guarantee s of future success . Take a careful look at your diploma . You \nwon’t see fine print with any such guarantee .  \nThat’s because t omorrow you will join the ranks o f millions of other college graduates  in \na workforce where more than one-third of all workers have at least as much education as you if \nnot more . So w hat happens from here is up to you, but that’s only partially true . Your lot in life \n                                                           \n1 Bureau of Labor Statistics d ata updated April 20, 2017 : https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm  \n2 Note workers age 25 and older.

To put it simply….. Life will happen.  \nSo what exactly does the path to success look like?  Here’s a spoiler alert . I think I know \nmost of the ingredients, but I don’t have the re cipe.  \nWhen I meet with n ew employees at the Kansas City Fed, they often  ask me about my \nown career path and whether I knew early on that I wanted to be the president and CEO of a \nFederal Reserve Bank . The truth is I had no such goal . In fact, I had neither  a plan nor a carefully \nconstructed series of strategic moves to reach the position I’m in today. I was focused on making \na living . Along the way, I worked hard and found the work I did meaningful and challenging. \nAnd each assignment became the rung to the  next one.  \nToday, as I look back at my own path, I can see that any measure of success I realized \nhad much to do with the experiences and lessons I learned along the way .  I’ve condensed those \nyears of experiences and lessons learned into f ive simple rules .  They’ve served me well. A nd as \nyou move into the ranks of the dreamers and doers , you might consider them:  \n1) Be prepared:  There really are no shortcuts to doing your best. Few people can  \nsuccessfully wing it. Most of us have to spend  time and make sacrifices to be prepared for that  \ninterview, to complet e a job assignment  on time , to earn a raise. But that preparation arms  you \nwith knowledge and gives you confidence.  \n2) Be flex ible:  Things won’t always go as planned. And sometimes, we bui ld plans that  \ncan fall apart. If you can learn to accept that  life is unpredictable and full of change, you’ll  be \nable to adapt and cope.  \n3) Be brave : You will have to make choices of consequence. It is not always clear what \nthe right answer is, but make s ure you ask  the right questions . And then choose.  \n\n4) Be humb le: Regardless of how confident you may be, you are not always right.  Listen \ncarefully to others. You might learn  something.  \n5) Be grat eful:  Everyday someone is doing work that makes your job easier, safer and \nless stressful. Look around you today —I suspect  some of those people are right here.  \n \nAs you come to this stage to accept your diploma today, I hope you enjoy the feeling of \naccomplishment . But I would encourage you not to confuse this ac hievement , and those to come , \nwith making your mark in other important ways . As you strive for success – and you should – \nkeep your focus on the things that define who you are and what you stand for :  your values, your \nintegrity, your work ethic , your service to others . These are within your control and these are \nwhat matter in the long run . If you focus on these , regardless of whether you achieve your best \ndreams and hopes, whether you get the next promotion, or secure wealth or fame, you will have \naimed for those things in a principled way .  \nJohn Adams, one of America’s founding fathers , expressed this sentiment well. During \nsome of the darkest days of the American Revolution, he worried about whether the struggle for \nindependence would be won . In a letter to his wife Abigail  in 1776 , he made a profound \nstatement when he wrote , “We can’t guarantee success, but we can deserve it.”  \nAnd so it is for each of you . The degree you are about to receive does not represent what \nyou know, but what you are capable of learning . So choose your path carefully .  Because t he \nworld is looking to you to tackle the challenges we face, to  repair the divisions  we see , and to \nbuild on the opportunities ahead of you . And whatever the outcome, and however success will be \ndefined for you, if you go about it in the right way, y ou too can deserve it."

Not only \nconsidering how those effects ripple through the economy but also how they ripple through time \nand the implications that those policy actions can have well into the future.  \nToday, I am go ing to be sharing with you my views on recent economic developments \nalong with my thoughts on the outlook for the national economy and the appropriate course of \nmonetary policy. I want to stress that these views are my own and not those of the Federal \nRese rve System.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nThe U.S. economy’s average 2 percent growth rate is quite modest by historical \nmeasures . Expansions dating back to 1961 have produced growth of some 4.1 percent  on \naverage . But what this current expansion has lacked in strength, it has made up for in longevity . \nApril  marks the 94th consecutive month of growth, making it the third -longest U.S. expansion on \nrecord going back to about 1850 .  \nOver this recovery, the  U.S. economy has witnessed a remarkable impro vement in labor \nmarkets . The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 4. 4 percent today.  \nGranted, this is a broad measure , and it is true that some areas of the labor market could benefit \nfrom further improvement . Rather than picking and choos ing which indicators best describe the \nstate of the labor market , Kansas City Fed staff looked at how we could summarize 24 different \nlabor market variables  by creating two indicators : one that looks at the level of labor market \nactivity , and the  other at the momentum of that activity . The most recent results confirm \n\n \n \n2 \n continued strength . Both indicators were above their  historical average s, suggesting a somewhat \n“tight” labor market with forward momentum pointing to continued improvement.  In fact, the \nmomentum indicator is at its highest lev el in the history of the series, which goes back to the \nearly 1990s.  \n With labor markets showing little or no slack, why then did real Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP)  only grow 0.7 percent in the first qua rter?  Importantly, does  this weakness call for the \nFederal Reserve to pause its process of normalizing monetary policy?   \nFor a number of reasons , I think the answer is “No .”  \n First, some of the weakness reflects unusually mild winter weather that led consumer \nspending on housing and utilities to  decline sharply in  the first quarter. Although such an effect \ntemporarily reduces measured output, it is  clearly not cause for concern. In fact, household \nsaving increased  by over half of a percentage point bet ween December and March, likely \nreflecting lower utility bills.  \nThe second reason  is a more  technical one  – what economists call “residual seasonality .” \nNamely, despite the best effort of statisticians to smooth through predictable seasonality , we \nhave seen a pattern emerge in recent years in which measured growth is weak er in the first \nquarter than it is  during  the rest of the year . I suspect  we are seeing  this same dynamic , at least in \npart, in 2017.   \nThe third reason is that economic data is subject to dips and spikes . Despite best efforts, \nmeasuring a dynamic, $ 19 trillion dollar economy is an extremely difficult task . As a result, w e \nshould be ca reful not to overreact to  every move in reported data. To illustrate some of the \nchallenges in me asuring economic activity, m y staff recently issued a report on the so -called \nsharing economy,  a business model in which customers who are looking for rides  or rooms, \n\n \n \n3 \n among other goods and services, are matched with providers via online platforms.1 While this \ntype of activity remains too small to affect our understanding of recent macroeconomic trends, \nthe report highlights some of the difficulties statisticians face when trying to capture emerging \neconomic trends .  \nAs we consider these factors  affecting the nation’s GDP , we are likely seeing a \nsignificant amount of noise. The core signal, I believe, may have more strength than what we are \ncurrently able to determine.  \nStill, interpreting the data is a balancing act . Just as one should not overreact t o each \nsingle data point , it is important to watch for signal s that could mark a turn in the economy . For \nexample , one area I am watching closely is auto sales. After setting a record last year with 17.5 \nmillion light weight vehicles sold, the pace of vehi cle sales slowed  in the first quarter. Recently -\nreleased data for April  did rebound a bit to just under 17 million on an annualized basis, but sales \nremain below last year’s level . Some cooling raise s questions about softening consumer  demand . \nOn the other  hand , indicators of consumer sentiment remain high, gas prices remain low , \nhousehold balance sheets are, on average, healthy and other fundamentals suggest consumers \nhave the ability to continue spending.  \nAll told, w hile the recent GDP report  and auto sal es may be flashing yellow, numerous \nother indicators remain solid  green. In particular, consumer and business confidence remain \nstrong, as do s urveys of business conditions . For example, the  ISM manufacturing index, which \nsurveys manufacturing firms across the U.S. about business conditions, has been signaling a \nstrengthening manufacturing sector over the last eight months . Its nonmanufacturing counterpart, \nwhich covers the broader se rvices s ectors , has also been solid as of late .  \n                                                           \n1 Redmond, Michael. 2017 . “Waiting for a Pickup: GDP and the Sharing Economy ,” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, The Macro Bulletin , April.  \n\n \n \n4 \n Likewise, global economic conditions have improved, supporting exports, and downside \nrisks posed by China and Europe have diminished . Given the strength of fundamentals across a \nrange of sectors, I expect the econom y to continue growing at a slightly above -trend rate.  \nWith this outlook, I view inflation  dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s goal of price stability . Personal consumption expenditure ( PCE) inflation was 1.8 \npercent over the past yea r after averaging just 1 percent for much of 2016 , and core inflation has \nbeen trending up . Its unexpected decline in March  appears to reflect some one -off factors as \nopposed to broader disinflationary pressure . It seems reasonable to l ook through this volatility, \nwith labor markets continuing to improve, and longer -term inflation expectations staying \nanchored near 2 percent.  \n \nThe Balance of Risks  \n Developing an outlook for the economy requires not only judging the health of the \neconomy over a medium -term horizon, but also requires an assessment of the nature of risks to \nthat forecast . Now that the U.S. has  largely  recovered from the Great Recession  – the \nunemployment rate is below its estimated longer -run level , real gross domestic produ ct (GDP ) is \ngrowing slightly above its estimated trend, and inflation is near the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s (FOMC)  longer -run objective of 2 percent  – I will turn to my thoughts on the \nbalance of risks . And here I would point out an important shift  in the FOMC’s assessment of \nrisks since it took its first steps to normalize monetary policy in December 2015 .  \nAt th at time, inflation was moving closer to the FOMC’s desired 2 percent objective , and \nthe labor market reflected substantial improvement . How ever, nearly half of the FOMC \n\n \n \n5 \n participants continued to view the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside – highlighting \nconcerns that inflation might start to move further below the objective.  \nA year later, with sustained improvements in the labor market and progress toward the \nCommittee’s inflation objective, the FOMC took a second step toward monetary policy \nnormalization , raising short -term interest rates another 25 basis points . By then , the assessment \nof risks had changed . An overwhelming majority of participants viewed  the risk to their inflation \nforecasts for 2017 as broadly balanced, and a few more  report ed that risks were weighted more \nto the upside  than the downside.   \nThe same is true for judgments about risk to the outloo k for the unemployment rate . A \nlarge majority currently  sees risks as broadly balanced, but a few participants see risks that the \nunemployment rate is more likely to be even lower than their projection.  \n The assessment that risks to the unemployment rate a re balanced right now  is a \nreasonable one, although having the unemployment rate fall below its longer -run level  is not \nwithout risk . At 4. 4 percent, the unemployment rate is  already below the FOMC’s median \nestimate of the longer -run unemployment rate , and overshooting poses risk to the sustainab ility \nof the expansion . Past e pisodes to push unemployment lower than its longer -run level have \nended in recession, and for that reason, adjusting policy to ensure the economy remains on a \nsustainable growth tr ajectory is of paramount importance.  \nOthers may argue that concerns about the economy potentially overheating  are \nexaggerated. For example, the link between low unemployment and rising wages is weaker than \nit was a few decades ago. This means tighter labo r markets may be  unlikely to generate as much \ninflation as in the past. While I acknowledge that the link between real activity and inflation \nappears to have diminished, there could very well be conditions when the relationship reasserts \n\n \n \n6 \n itself. That is, under tight labor markets, employees may find themselves with significantly more \nbargaining power to negotiate for higher wage s, which in turn could translate into more \ninflationary pressure.  \nAnother point often raised to suggest  the Fed eral Reserve  need not be overly concerned \nwith tight labor markets is that inflation has been running below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal  for \nan extended period . Such low rates of inflation seem to have lowered longer -run inflation \nexpectations. Given the infla tion goal is symmetric, meaning that the Committee gives equal \nweight to deviations above and below the goal, some argue there is scope to let inflation drift \nabove 2 percent for a time, particularly if it would help anchor expectations more firmly around \n2 percent.   \nI have not yet found this argument compelling . The most recent estimate from the Survey \nof Professional Forecasters points to future levels of inflation slightly  above the FOMC’s 2 \npercent goal. In fact, s ome consumer expectations of inflation have slipped, but not sufficiently \nto suggest they have become fundamentally unanchored from the inflation goal.  \n \nMonetary Policy  \nLast week, t he FOMC took no action  to change policy , although it remains on a path to \nremove accommodation in a gradual manner . Given my own economic outlook and assessment \nof the balance of risks, I support this policy path .  \nIt is worth noting that e ven as the FOMC has increased short -term rates , financial \nconditions remain accommodative . Looking a t the Kansas City Fed ’s Financial Stress Index , \nwhich synthesizes 11 financial market v ariables , the index has generally declined over the past \n\n \n \n7 \n six months despite two rate increases . Thus, t he modest amount of removal of monetary \naccommodation has had little notable effect on broader financial conditions.  \nLooking ahead, a  natural question is how gradual will the monetary policy normalization \nprocess be?  According to the Fed’s Survey of Economic Projections , the median calls for another \n2 moves this year  and f inancial markets appear to expect another 1 or 2 moves . The FOMC has \njudged that m oving gradually  is appropriate . Understandably, moving too aggressively risks \nslowing economic activity  or even derail ing the expansion . Removing accommodation in small \ndoses is consistent wi th the economy’s improving fundamentals  and perceived benign rates of \ninflation.  \nAlternatively , policy cannot move  too gradually. Postponing the removal of \naccommodation when the economy is at full employment and inflation near 2 percent poses  risks \nto longer-run economic and financial stability . Moving too slow ly carries the risk of pushing the \nunemployment rate below its sustainable rate  and inviting recession  as history shows . Failing to \nkeep interest rates in line with improving fundamentals also can distort the allocation of capital \ntoward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, endeavors .  \nAs monetary policy continues on a gradual path of tightening, questions emerge about the \nimpact to those sectors of the economy that are especially interest r ate sensitive . This concern is \noften associated with the housing sector . However, I would note that t he housing market  has \nchanged significantly over the past decade. While demand fueled rising home prices  prior to the \nfinancial crisis , it seems that lack of supply is now the dominant factor. For example, research by \nmy staff suggests the number of households is at least 3.5 million below its trend, even after \naccounting for demographics and changes in preferences. The unmet demand for housing may \nface a more persistent lack of supply, due in part to limited land available for development  in \n\n \n \n8 \n desirable areas . Conditions vary across regions, but with a limited supply of housing  and a strong \nlabor market , prices are likely to continue rising  even as interest ra tes gradually go up . Even with \nsuch conditions, while h igher home prices may boost measures of household wealth, those  \nhouseholds that spend a relatively larger share of their income on shelter  will face challenges.  \n Finally, removing policy accommodation  goes beyond increasing the level of the federal \nfunds rate . The FOMC also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities \nholdings . The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion , or almost 25 \npercent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago . The composition of this balance \nsheet has changed as well . Ten years ago, the balance sheet was primarily comprised of short -\nterm Treasuries . Today, mortgage -backed a nd agency securities make up about 40 percent of \nassets .  \nWith these changes, the FOMC faces unprecedented challenges for its decision -making \ntoday, such as when to begin the process  of reducing the size and altering the composition , and \nhow to communicate the approach and the timing to the public . My own view is that the process \nshould begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage -backed securities \n(MBS)  and long -term Treasury securities . Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio  \nshould be on autopilot and not reconsidered at  each subsequent FOMC meeting . Otherwise, the \nCommittee w ould need to re -evaluate and make adjustments that will potentially complicate \nmonetary policy and provide few benefits to the real economy.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe economy continues to expand as sustained j ob growth and solid gains in household \nspending  – the weak first quarter notwithstanding  – are mutually reinforcing. The international \n\n \n \n9 \n backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this \nenvironment, the role for monetary p olicy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. \nTherefore, a s labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary \naccommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 4, 2017  \nFaster Payments Task Force Meeting  \nChicago, Ill.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the \nFederal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Good morning.  It is my pleasure to join you today  to recognize the tremendous \ncontributions you’ve made to this public -private effort aimed at improving t he nation’s \npayments infrastructure .  This is one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of \nour country’s payment s system and one that is essential to the growing and evolving \ndemands of businesses and consumers .  I also want to thank Gordon Werkema and his \nteam  for the expertise and leadership they’ve brought to this engagement  on behalf of the \nFede ral Reserve . \nCharting a course for faster payments has been demanding, but the progress \nwe’ve seen is rewarding .  It signals that even as more work lies ahead, we can build on \nthe experience of the past two years to achieve the desired outcomes  identified in the \n2015 paper Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment  System .  This morning, I’d like to \ntalk briefly about the progress achieved to date  and then offer my thoughts on  the road \nahead for the Fed eral Reserve  and the payments industry .  \nBefore I continue, now would be a good time to remind  you that the views I \nexpress here  are my own and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nProgress report  \nIn 2012, the Fed eral Reserve  was among those noting that the U.S. payment \nsystem was undergoing a period of rapid change , and contemplating the implications . \nConsumers and businesses were turning increasingly to e -commerce and Internet -enabled \ntechnologies.  In the midst of this transition, payment security was being challenged by \nnew, dyn amic, and escalating threats.  \nTraditional payment services had been adj usting slowly to these changes , while \nemerging players were coming to market with innovative product offerings .  Avoiding \n\n2 \n fragmentation and facilitating end -to-end adoption required a more coordinated rather \nthan organic approach  to ensure that issues of access and security could be broadly \nconsidered . \nA path forward took shape with extensive industry dialogue in the form of the \nStrategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System  paper pub lished in 2015.  Within the \npaper were strategies based on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following \nareas: speed, security, efficiency, cross -border payments and industry collaboration.  \nAs this group knows better than anyone, industry stake holders and the Federal \nReserve have invested significantly over the past two years in efforts to advance toward \nthe desired outcomes outlined in that paper.  While some thought our efforts would fall \nvictim to proprietary interests and a lack of cooperati on, substantial measureable progress \nhas been made on a number of issues and there is significant momentum towards \naddressing some of the more intractable issues that will demand a more sustained focus.  \nEarlier this year , the Task Force released Part One  of its final report and I look \nforward to seeing Part Two  when it becomes available this summer .  Once completed, \nthis document will share assessments of proposals for faster payments solutions and \nrecommend next steps for the industry to take to achieve safe and accessible faster \npayments capabilities.  Together, these documents will provide a comprehensive report of \nthe Task Force’s work.  Feedback from private sector providers suggests they have found \nthis work to be worthwhile and promising  as they see k to design and deliver faster \npayment capabilities to end users.  \nOf course , while th e Task Force has been at work  on these issues , the payment s \nsystem has continued to evolve .  Innovation and new capabilities have emerged from the \nprivate sector and the Federal Reserve also has continued to improve the services it \n\n3 \n provides .  For example, same -day ACH credit payments began flowing through the \nnetworks last fall, with 13 million payments cleared same -day in the first 100 days.  \nAlthough not real -time, this development is an important and tangible step toward faster  \npayments in the United States.  Additionally, g lobal messaging standards (ISO 20022) \nhave been adopted for better interoperability .  Innovations in the card space now facilitate \nreal-time P2P tran sfers via credit push.  And many fintech and social media entities are \ndelivering payment services with some real -time attributes through stored value or card \non file models.  The payments industry is also exploring models that leverage virtual \ncurrency an d distributed ledger technology in delivering faster payment solutions.  \n \nThe Road Ahead  \nWhile the efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Faster Payments Task Force have \ndriven significant progress , we recognize that the desired outcomes identified in the 2015 \npaper have yet to be realized .  With continuing technological innovation and the \nemergence of new potential security threats, real work remains if we are to achieve and \nmaintain a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capability.  \nOngoing innovation and m arket activity, including a variety of proposals \nreviewed by the Task Force , suggests the potential for multiple solutions in the faster \npayments market.  However, the lack of established industry standards and rules could \nhinder interoperability  of these solutions, resulting in fragmentation and inhibiting \ncompetition over time .  Such conditions could  negatively affect the ability to “pay \nanyone” and constrain access and adoption. Study of the payment system also teaches \nthat over time, consolida tion of providers seeking economies of scale and scope may \noccur, adversely affecting competition, an essential ingredient to innovation and serving \n\n4 \n the needs of consumer and business end users.  I am encouraged by the amount of \nattention that you’ve given to considering these kinds of critical issues  and challenges . \nFurther progress is needed in other aspects as well .  As highlighted in the \nStrategies paper, developing settlement services to support real -time payments  is yet to \nbe addressed .  Faster payment  capabilities that rely on current settlement systems would \nhave end user service gaps or real -time end user service offerings with deferred \nsettlement.  Deferred interbank settlement could create credit or liquidity risks for \nfinancial institutions and po tential risk for the financial system.  We will continue to \nwork with the industry to understand such issues  as solutions are implemented.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’s role  \nOver the next decade, I anticipate that changes to the payment s system will only \naccelerate, but in uncertain ways .  As it has done in the past, the nature of the Federal \nReserve ’s engagement going forward will likely evolve.  \nThe Faster Payments Task Force is only the most recent example  of the \ncooperation between the Fed eral Reserve  and the private sector that has historically \ncontributed to a more efficient and effective payments system .  This history include s the \ndevelopment of routing numbers, the growth of the automated clearing house network \nand the crafting of Check 21 legislatio n. \nA secure and smooth -functioning payments system is a critical component of \neconomic growth and stability.  Recognizing this, the Federal Reserve has sought to \npromote its “integrity and efficiency  … and to ensure the provision of payment services \nto all depository institutions on an equitable basis … in an atmosphere of competitive \n\n5 \n fairness.”1    \nThe Federal Reserve’s dual role as an operator and regulator  in the U.S. payments \nsystem is  often viewed as unique  relative to approaches in other countries .  Throughout \nU.S. history, consumers, merchants, financial institutions, policymakers and others have \ngrappled with the question of who is ultimately responsible for what congressional \nleaders in 1913 called the “highways of commerce .”  From the chaos of the early 19th \ncentury through  today’s digital transactions, there has been a spirited deb ate over the \ncentral bank’s roles and responsibilities.2   \nToday’s  active participation in a range of activities  position s the Federal Reserve \nto bring perspective and insight to the challenges and emerging issues affecting the \npayments landscape .  While some public authorities in other countries have acted based \non explicit mandates, the Fed eral Reserve has leveraged the experience of its existing \ncentral bank roles to serve as a catalyst for critical improvement to the payments systems.  \nIn this role, we have facilitate d the important work of the more than 300 individuals \ninvolved in the Task Force.  And, as is noted in the strategies paper, the Federal Reserve \nremains  committed to serving as a leader, convener and catalyst as appropriate to foster a \nwell-functioning payments system for the public . \nI very much look forward to continuing our work  with the industry to shape  the \nnecessary improvements in our  payments system that support confidence, economic \ngrowth and global competitiveness going forwa rd. \n                                                           \n1 The Federal Reserve in the Payments System , revised 1990  \n2 See: Medley, Bill.

Minsky Conference  \nLevy Economics Institute of Bard College  \nAnnandale -on-Hudson, N.Y. \n \n      The views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives. \n\n1 \n I’d like to thank the organizers of this year’s Mins ky C onference for inviting me to speak. \nThe topics to be addressed at this event highlight a number of policy choices facing our nation \ntoday . The implications of those choices are far -reaching not only to the Main Streets of this \ncountry but also to economies  around the world. Central bank monetary policies loom large \namong those policy choices .  \nOver the past 15 months, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has begun the  \nprocess of gradually removing nearly a decade of monetary accommodation. Th at \naccommodation came in the form of both conventional interest rate policy , which lowered short -\nterm rates to near zero, and a series of more unconventional policy actions  – namely , large -scale \nasset purchases  and forward guidance . The actions  were both lauded and critic ized. Indeed, in \nMarch 2009, one member of the FOMC commented  on the very difficult situation of determining \nan appropriate policy response  at that time , noting “we’re in a position where doing the right \nthing is not obvious.”1    \nIf doing “the right thing” was not obvious at that time , then the path to unwinding these \nextraordinary policy actions  and returning to more conventional policy approaches is no less \nfraught with questions about the FOMC’s decision -making framework . How will conventional \nand unconventional policy accommodation be removed and what are the implications ? Is the \nprocess of normalizing policy “behind the curve ?” What linkages exist between balance sheet \nadjustment s and interest rates ? What level of interest  rates  best supports long -run price stability ? \nMy r emarks today will not attempt to answer many of these important questions . Instead, \nI will focus on the process of policy normalization and its challenges , particularly as it relates to \nunwinding the Federal Res erve’s balance sheet . I’ll begin with the economic backdrop under \nwhich the FOMC is considering these policy adjustments.  \n                                                           \n1 Donald Kohn, FOMC meeting transcript, March 17- 18, 2009.  \n\n2 \n The views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by other participants on \nthe FOMC.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nFor the most part, t he economy looks to be on solid footing. Consumers are confident and \nthey are spending , household balance sheets are in better shape , and house prices are rising . \nEmployment has gained traction, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.5 percent . Business \ninvestment and productivity growth ha ve been somewhat sluggish for most of the recovery, but \nprofitability has again increased . The energy and manufacturing sectors also are bouncing back \nwith the stabilization in oil prices and the fore ign exchange value of the U .S. dollar . In general, \nthe economy has come a very long way since the financial crisis that began nearly a decade ago  \nand has weathered a number of shocks over the course of this lengthy  expansion.  \nDespite the apparent health of the economy, r isks are always on the horizon. Today, \nhowever, there is a sense that outcomes could actually  be better than expected, rather than worse. \nFor example, in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, more participants now \nsee risks th at real GDP growth and inflation could  be higher than forecast, rather than lower. \nThis shift in risk assessment is in sharp c ontrast  to the more pessimistic view s that dominate d \npast projections . Such an outlook has allowed the  FOMC to continue  the proces s of \nnormalization.  \n \nUnwinding the B alance S heet \nPrior to the financial crisis, the business of setting monetary policy involved few moving \nparts . FOMC decisions could be steered with a fair amount of precision by the Federal Reserve’s \n\n3 \n Open Market Desk and with a relatively modest amount of intervention in financial markets. \nThere were other aspects to the process, but the tools and considerations were generally well \nunderstood and relatively  straightforward . \nToday, conducting monetary policy is consider ably more complicated , owing in part  to \nthe size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet . Prior to the financial crisis  and \nrecession , the Fed’s balance sheet was slightly less than $1 trillion with a portfolio of short -term \nTreasuries . Over  the period from 2009 to 2014, a series of large- scale asset purchases swelled the \nbalance sheet to nearly  $4.5 trillion, and the portfolio shifted to include mortgage -backed \nsecurities and long -term Treasur ies.  \nThese unprecedented actions were carefully considered with a desire to boost economic \nactivity . Faced with the prospect of potential nearer -term benefits, the associated costs  were \ngenerally difficult to quantify and viewed to be well into the future, perhaps making them easier \nto discount . As a voting member who dissented in 2013, I believed these costs outweighed the \nbenefits  at that time . \nThe key challenge for monetary policy today  is to unwind this large balance sheet  in the \nleast disruptive manner . It is an important step and one that  the FOMC a nticipated  going back to \nJune 2011 when exit strategy principles were initially framed . Following decisions to expand the \nbalance sheet further, the  FOMC revisited the exit strategy principles in 2014 and outlined its \napproach to monetary policy  normalization  in September of that year .  \nIt is difficult to know with a high degree of confidence just how the economy and \nfinancial markets will react once the FOMC announces and then takes steps to reduce the size of \nits securities holdings . Some believe that the benefits of the actions that swelled the balance sheet \nwere modest, and as a result, the costs of its unwinding  also could be of little consequence to the \n\n4 \n broader economy . Others believe that t he eff ects on the economy were substantial  and that  \nactions to reduce its size need to be taken with a great deal of care and caution . Of course, it is \nalso possible that any  benefits gained from the balance sheet  expansion w on’t reverse when it \nshrinks . While evidence from a variety of  sources and studies will inform decisions about \npossible effects and how to proceed, the implications for the economy are uncertain.  \nIn addition, balance sheet actions have the potential to complicate interest rate policy. \nThere is likely some tradeoff between adjusting interest rates and shrinking the balance sheet, but \nthe specifics of the tradeoff are hard  to quantify. This uncertainty and additional complexity \nraises the risk of a policy error or could spark a bout of financial market volatility .  \nBeyond the mechanics of shrinking a large balance sheet, establishing a sound framework \nfor the timing of balance sheet adjustments will be important. To that end, the FOMC discussed at its most recent meeting in March various aspects of a n appropriate decision- making \nframework to guide its actions . \nBalance sheet adjustments will need to be gradual  and smooth, which is an approach that \ncarries the least risk in terms of a strategy to normalize its size . Importantly, once the process \nbegins, it should continue without re consideration at each subsequent FOMC meeting . In other \nwords, the process should be on autopilot and not necessarily vary with moderate movements in the economic data . To do otherwise would amount to using the balance sheet as an active tool of \npolicy outside of periods of severe financial or economic stress , and would increase uncert ainty \nrather than reduce it .  \n   \n\n5 \n Avoiding Monetary “Fine Tuning”  \nBased on economic conditions, I would support beginning the process of reducing the \nbalance sheet this year . This would further normalize the stance of policy and leave more highly  \nliquid, safe securities available to the market . I do not favor prolonging action for the purpose of \nallow ing inflation  to overshoot the 2 percent goal or to press labor markets into a condition \nwhere they are overheating .  \nAt the time the FOMC adopted the 2 percent  inflation target in 2012, the unfamiliar \nnature and unknown consequences of large scale asset purchases had piqued concerns about the \nimplications for inflation expectations . Anchoring these expectations with a  more  explicit \ncommitment to price stability  was appropriate. I supported that decision. In the years following, \nhowever, i nflation ran below the  stated target  – although at times only slightly below – and only \nrecently has it moved above the target to 2.1 percent .  \nIn its annual S tatement on Longer -Run G oals and Monetary Policy S trateg y, the FOMC \ntalks about the nature of its inflation objective . Specifically, inflation that persistently deviates \nabove or below the 2 percent objective would be cause for concern, but monetary policy  need not \nreact to  temporary deviations . Importantly, I do not interpret the strategy as calling for inflation \nto linger above 2 percent to make up for past shortfalls, but rather for inflation to move toward 2 percent in the long run without any deliberat e overshooting . Continuing highly accommodative \npolicy or adjusting monetary policy in response to modest shortfalls or overshoots from the inflation goal is an attempt at  monetary fine tuning that is often not practical and may ultimately \nprove costly .  \nAlthough inflation is running close to 2 percent today and is expected to remain there, the \nprices of different goods and services rise at very different rates . For example, services inflation \n\n6 \n has been running well above 2 percent, and housing rents in part icular have been playing a key \nrole in moving inflation higher . By several measures, rents are rising faster than aggregate \nwages . Keeping monetary policy easy to achieve higher inflation has the potential to push rents \nstill higher, negatively affecting a  large percentage of households. Consequently, I am not as \nenthusiastic or encouraged as some when I see inflation moving higher, especially when it has \nbeen driven by a sector like housing . Inflation is a tax and t hose least able to afford it  generally \nsuffer the most .  \nSuch concentration and persistently rising prices in one area suggests the economy is \nstruggling to reallocate resources . For housing, it could reflect several factors such as tight \nlending standards faced by home builders and scarcity of skilled craftsmen needed to construct homes. I expect the market to eventually solve  for, or at least adapt  to, such factors . Using \nmonetary policy however to compensate for them  could easily end up hurting the population the \npolicy is intended to help. \n \nConclusion  \nOverall , I am encouraged by the sta rt of the normalization process and want to see it \ncontinue . Resisting the temptation to react to near -term fluctuations in the data  will be necessary . \nLooking ahead, w e should expect inflation to move up and down around 2 percent . A modest \ndecline in inflation  or an overshoot  may not necessarily warrant  the monetary policy  \nnormalization process to slow or accelerate. Such attempts at monetary fine -tuning can easily \nbackfire, so a more forward looki ng view of inflation is needed . This is not uncommon and it is \nwhy many economists and policymakers emphasize the importance of inflation expectations . In \n\n7 \n fact, t he FOMC also has long -emphasized their importance , typically with specific mention in \neach FOMC statement .  \nThe important factor is that the public, markets, and policymakers see the setting for \nmonetary policy supporting the 2 percent inflation goal in the long run, rather than expect a \npolicy that  tries  to keep inflation squarely pinned at 2 percent under all circumstances.  \nWhile both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are in range to meet the FOMC’s \nobjectives, the federal funds rate is  far from its longer- run level  and the balance sheet remains \nlarge with reinvestment of maturing securities . Continuing along the path of normalization  even \nin the face of uncertainty is necessary to achieving long -run objectives for the economy , \nincluding price stability and full employment on a sustained basis."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 6 , 2017  \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York Community Banking Conference  \nNew York, N.Y.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n2 \n Community banks have an important connection with the Federal Reserve . Across the 12 \nFederal  Reserve Banks, some 68 bankers serve as directors on either Reserve Bank or  Branch \nboards and nearly all of them are community bankers . These individuals bring important \nperspectives to our work . I appreciate their contributions as well as  the core function that \ncommunity banks  serve in thousands of communities across  the United States.  \nI hope you’ll indulge me as I briefly preface my remarks this morning with some \npersonal history . Yesterday marked a milestone for me:  35 years of service with the Federal \nReserve . When I came to work for the Kansas City Fed as a bank examiner in 1982 , I was also a \nfirst-time homeowner. I was delighted to have a job that would help me pay my bills, especially \nmy mortgage . At that time, I thought I’d made a s teal to have assumed a n existing  mortgage at \nthe low rate  of 12 percent.  \nWorking at  the Fed, I soon came to appreciate that it was a particularly challenging year \nfor the banking industry . Our  region was hard hit by the trifecta of downturn s in commercial real \nestate , energy and ag riculture . That year, the failure of a small bank in Oklahoma triggered the \nfailure and eventual government bailout of one of the largest bank s in the U .S. Meanwhile, \nhundreds of banks failed in the Tenth District. This was the en vironment in which I was trained \nto be a bank supervisor .  \nThis also was the year that a former N ew York Fed president , Gerald Corrigan , wrote an \nessay  titled  “Are Banks Specia l?”1  It proved to be a foundational piece that has been \noccasionally revisited  by others in the 35 years  since . Today, I would like to return to the theme \nof Mr. Corrigan’s essay by looking at the role of banks while asking a slightly different question, \n“Do traditional banks still matter to the U.S. economy? ”    A spoiler alert: M y answer is a \n                                                 \n1 E. Gerald  Corrigan served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1984 and \npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1985 to 1993.  \n\n3 \n definitive “yes.” I’ll use the remainder of my time today outlining why this is so , and why I \nbelieve this key component of the U .S. economy may be at risk.  \nBefore going further, I should note that my comments today are my views only and not \nthose of the Federal Reserve System or its Board of Governors.  \n \nThe Banking Landscape  in 1982  \nIn an interview some years later, Mr. Corrigan recalled the reason he wrote the 1982 \nessay. Simply put, t he competitive position of traditional banks was rapidly eroding, and \npolicymakers were contemplating the implications.  \nIn the early 1980s , the combination of high interest rates and deposit rate ceilings made it \ndifficult for banks to  compete with alternatives that were not subject to the same restrictions, \nincluding savings and loan NOW accounts and money market mutual funds . By the time interest \nrate ceilings were eliminated  on most deposits , money market f unds were well established .  \nIn credit markets, the seeds of greater capital market competition for bank loans were \nalso planted in the early 1980s . The development of government and age ncy mortgage -backed \nsecurities were  followed by private  label mortgage and other asset -backed securities . Another \nmajor innovation was funding new credits with high -yield bond s, which previously had been \nused only to refinance companies whose debt had been downgraded below  investment grade .  \nGiven the dramatic nature of these changes, questions arose about whether the role of \nbanks had been diminished.  W ould these new nonbank entrants  supplant their role?  Did it \nmatter?   \nWith reflection on these questions, Mr. Corrigan  concluded that banks were different and \nunique in three ways :   \n\n4 \n  Only banks offered transaction deposits payable on demand at par and readily \ntransferable;   \n Banks served as the primary and ultimate source of liquidity for all other classes and \nsizes of institutions, both financial and nonfinancial;  \n Banks served as the transmission mechanism for monetary policy which , combined \nwith operating the payments mechanis m, facilitates efficient markets and ord erly end \nof day settlement – a particularly important role in periods of financial stress .  \nAt that time, these special characteristics of banks had three important implications for \nthe structure of our financial sys tem and its regulation :   \n No other type of financial company had its funding protected by the public safety net \nof federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve discount window .  \n Banks were regulated and supervised because of th is safety net and th eir key role in \nthe economy . At that time, the separation of commercial banking from investment \nbanking and commerce was an important part of the prudential regulatory structure .  \n Only banks had direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails .  \nFrom 1982  to 1999, the financial system continued to evolve, aided by regulatory \ninterpretation and court decisions . And the banking industry began to experience rapid  \nconsolidation . Much of the consolidation reflected mergers of smaller banks as intrastate and \ninterstate restrictions were relaxed . However, the most significant effect for the banking system \nwas an increase in the market share of the largest banks, driven by their efforts to create \nnationwide operations and enhance global competitiveness . During this  period, the market share \nof the ten largest banking companies increased from 28  percent  to 51 percent of total banking \nassets.  \n\n5 \n The scale of these firms made it profitable to operate securities dealing and underwriting \nsubsidiaries under the Glass -Steagal l Act’s Section 20 authority . This was the first major crack in \nthe wall between commercial and investment banking.  In 1999, Glass -Steagall gave way to the \nGramm -Leach -Bliley Act (GLBA) , which  invited bank holding companies to adopt investment \nbanking activities  with important safety net advantages .  \nWith the  addition of these nonbanking activities , the 10 largest bank ing organization s \nsaw their market share rise further to 55 percent  in 2007. Meanwhile, the composition of their \nassets changed dramatica lly. The average portfolio share of nonbanking assets  rose from only 13 \npercent in 1997 to 25 percent in 2007 .  \nThis summer marks the tenth  anniversary of the financial crisis . That event brought to \nlight what had previously only been conceptually understo od:  the largest banking organizations \nwere highly interconnected and indeed  too big to fail (TBTF) . The safety net designed  to cover \nonly commercial banking activities  was stretched well beyond the insured depository \nsubsidiaries to the ir parent companies and nonbanking subsidiaries . However, only commercial \nbanks truly retained the unique characteristics that Mr. Corrigan argued made them special.  \nAs a practical matter, t he largest banks were the only firms that could acquire other large \nand troubled investment banks, commercial banks, and savings associations . The remaining large \nindependent investment banks became bank holding companies . As a result, the 10 largest \nbank ing organizations  now account for 67 percent of industry assets, whil e the average \nnonbanking -asset share of their portfolios has climbed to 29 percent .  \nAs I look through the lens of the past 35 years, the financial system landscape has \ncertainly changed. There are three  features that I find particularly striking  over this period . \n\n6 \n  Banking system assets as a share of financial system assets have fallen from 37 to 19 \npercent .  \n The number of banks has significant ly decline d from more than 18,000 to around  \n5,000, largely reflected in fewer community banks with less than $100 million of \nassets .  \n Community banks’ market share  fell from 45 percent in 1982 to just 13 percent today .  \nWhat has emerged within the banking system are two very different kinds of commercial \nbank ing firm s:  a small number of very large bank ing o rganization s with significant nonbanking \nactivities and sufficient scale to pose systemic risk to the economy , and thousands of traditional \nbanks generally referred to as community banks.  \n \nDo Traditional Banks M atter to the U .S. Economy in 2017 ? \nDespite such monumental shifts in the financial system landscape, one could reach the \nsame conclusion today as Mr. Corrigan did in 1982 . Namely, that the banking system retains a \nunique role in our economy . Banks are still the only type of financial firm t hat can provide \nliquidity whenever needed, ensure payments are readily transferable, and aid the implementation \nof monetary policy .  \nYet, the differences  between the largest banks and community banks are significant and \nthose differences pose important challenges for setting effective regulatory policy . This l eads me \nto ask a slightly different question  than Mr. Corrigan asked :  Are traditional banks , or \ncommunity banks , still important to the U.S. economy in 2017?   \nI answered this questi on affirmatively at the beginning of my remarks.   Indeed, \ntraditional banks are essential to thousands of communities across the country . In contrast to the \n\n7 \n large st banks, community banks still rely primarily on relationship lending, with a focus on \nfundin g local loans with core deposits . Their heterogeneous customer base and credit decisions \ninclude not only quantitative but qualitative aspects including judgments about the repayment \nability of their Main Street customers. These bankers serve on the boards  of local schools, \nhospitals  and other civic organizations, providing a key source of leadership in the community . \nThey serve their communit ies and are part of their communit ies.  \nBut do they matter to the U.S. economy as a whole?  Can o nline banking and scale satisfy \nthe credit needs on Main Street s and in rural areas ?  I am reminded that a lthough we often refer \nto “the U.S. economy ” in aggregate , as though it were a single  monolithic  entity , there are in fact \nthousands of micro -economie s that taken together make up the $19 trillion U.S. economy . In \nthese micro -economies, community banks are a critical source of financing for small businesses, \nincluding startups . While community banks account for just 13 percent of industry assets, they \nare responsible for some  40 percent of bank lending to small businesses . In turn, small \nbusinesses with less than 500 employees account for about 50 percent of U.S. private \nemployment .2 Moreover, recent research shows that small startups with 20  to 499 empl oyees \nplay a large role in net job creation that continues for up to five years after their formation.3  \nThis evidence indicates  community banks are still extremely important to our economy, \nalthough, their competitive position is under stress . Market forces of technology and innovation  \nare everywhere  and c ommunity banks will need to b e responsive to customer demand  for new \nservices and methods of banking . But these are not the forces that particularly concern me . The \nrisk I see stems from a misal igned regulatory environment that poses a threat in my view to the \n                                                 \n2 “United States Small Business Profile, 2016,” U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy.  \n3 See Robert Jay Dilger, “Small Business Administration and Job Creation,” Congressional Research Service, \nFebruary 8, 2017.  \n\n8 \n diversity of the U.S. banking system and healthy competition  that has long served the country \nwell.  \n \nPolicy Implications  \nToday , the nation stands at a crossroads of policy choices . As policymakers consider \nregulatory  reform , the special role of banks in our economy  and particularly the role of \ncommunity bank s, must factor into their decisions .  \nWe witnessed the tremendous cost of a financial crisis . The regulatory response that \nfollowed  was well  intended and even justified in its aims to end TBTF and protect consumers.  \nHowever,  while the aim was specific to the large st banks, the regulatory net has ensnared \nthousands of community banks . Regulators have applied supervisory approaches and protections \nthat often fail to take into account the incentives  and risk profile associated with relationship \nlending models  of community banks .  \nFor example, international capital standards , which formed the basis to reduce leverage in  \nthe biggest banks , layer on unnecessary reporting requirements and complexity for banks that \nalready held high levels of capital . Appraisal standards aimed to ensure independent valuations \nsupport new loans create  challenges for thousands of smaller banks that are portfolio  lenders . \nThese small institutions, often located in more rural markets, struggle  to find  knowledgeable \nappraisers with sufficient  comparable propert y sales to comply with the rules, and i n some cases, \nconclude that qualified borrowers ’ credit needs can’t be met .  \nFinally, rules aim ed at  protect ing consumers and other customers from unfair and \ndeceptive practices are important .  However, l ong-term relationship lending also aligns the \nincentives that protect community bank customers . Unfortunately, the compliance burden for \n\n9 \n community banks introduces costly processes along with fear and confusion as  they struggle to \napply  narrow  legal interpretations and opaque statistical models to the fair credit needs of their \nborrowers .  \nUltimately , communities suffer when access to credit is unnecessarily limited , and so \ndoes the larger economy .  Rules that aim to address the business models and incentives of the \nlargest banks may unintentionally put t he diversity of the banking system at risk , and the lack of \nnew bank  charter s over the past decade suggest s the barriers to entry may be high.   \n \nConclusion  \nThe regulatory remedy for today’s banking system will not be easily prescribed . But it \nwill need to recognize that the institutions we  collectively refer to as  “commercial banks” have \ndrifted apart over the past 35 years . At one end of the spectrum are banks that engage in global \nfinancing with systemic implications for failure and impact to the broader economy . At the other \nend are bank s that engage in traditional lend ing and deposit -taking , whose impact on small \nbusiness and small communities translates to real economic outcomes . \nToday, t he federal safety net supports both models and it is sagging , stretched by ever -\nlarger and more complex firms with significant nonbanking activities . Banking r egulation must \ndo its best to offset the very real exposures for taxpayers and the risk to economic and financial \nstability . Nurturing incentives that reward success and punish failure are key . Aligning regulation \nthat effectively addresses risk at both ends of this spectrum will require that regulators either \nclose the gap between their differences or embrace the two models and attempt to apply very \ndifferent supervisory frameworks  and approach es.  \n\n10 \n Market forces will continue to reshape the industry as they have for the past 35 years and \nlonger . And community bankers are no strangers to those market forces or a challenging \noperating environment . But the banking industry has evolved in very diffe rent ways and rules \nthat inhibit market forces without offsetting gain warrant scrutiny .  \nAs a highly concentrated banking system takes hold  in the U.S. , the issue of today’s \nbanking landscape poses a slightly different but important question about the abi lity of regulation \nto differentiate its aim . It will matter to thousands of communities served by you in the years \nahead , and by extension to the U.S. economy."

It is a pleasure to join you today , and  I am especially delighted that  Mylan \nGray , deputy chair of the Associated Students of Stanford University , is here this evening . Mylan \nis a Kansas Citian and an alum of the Kansas City Fed’s Student Board of Directors  program . \nFor the past two summe rs he has worked at the Bank as a “camp counselor ” at our Summer at \nthe Fed student program . That program introduces young students to banking, the economy and \npersonal finance . Last year, Mylan was the progr am’s activities director . \nThe mission of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research  is an important one . \nEconomic analysis and policy research  offers a critical foundation for policy deliberations . As a \nparticipant on the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) , our decision \nmaking and policy judgments  depend heavi ly on quality analysis to set a long -run course for \nmonetary policy , particularly when uncertainty dominates the landscape .  \nIn my remarks this evening , I’ll offer my view on the U.S. economy and  will talk a bit \nabout some of the challenges we have faced in the post -crisis environment . I’ll also  share my \nthoughts on what I believe to be the most appropriate action for policy moving forward . As \nalways, the views I express here are my own and are no t necessarily shared by others on the \nFOMC.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nThis month (Feb . 2017) marks the 92nd consecutive month of the economic expansion  in \nthe United States , which is the third -longest U.S. expansion on record going back to about 1850. \nSince the end of the financial crisis, the economy has grown annually by about 2 percent each \nyear. Unemployment has declined and labor markets appear to have only m odest, if any, \nremaining slack. Inflation has been running at rates consistent with price stability and near the \n\n2 \n FOMC’s longer -run goal of 2  percent . Of course, there are always some areas of concern \nin the economy, but as a whole , things look fairly positive.  \n Optimism has increased during the past few months, as measured in both business and \nconsumer surveys. While consumer spending is expected to continue  at a healthy pace , this rise \nin confidence may not  automatically lead to even stronger consumer spending. The evidence \nsuggests that consumer confidence is not always a useful predictor of future consumption \ngrowth, especially once other factors such as interest rates or incom e growth are taken into \naccount. Still, household balance sheets are in much better  shape compared to the years \nimmediately following the  financial crisis and the labor market has been performing well, so the \noutlook remains positive for consumer spending.  \nLooking at labor markets, we’re essentially at or near full employment. The \nunemployment rate now sits at 4.8 p ercent, just below  what I view as its longer -run value of \nabout 5 percent. Labor force participation, which had been trending downwards for most of the \nexpansion, has leveled off and even slightly increased  over the past year. This recent rise appears \nto be due to a decline in labor force exits rather than an increase in labor force entry. In other \nwords, individuals are not more likely to return to the labor force right now, but workers are \nstaying on the job a bit longer. These factors suggest that there is not a lot of labor force slack, \neither among the officially unemployed or those out of the labor force who might rejoin.  \nOf course , there are numerous indicators on the labor market, so trying to judge the \namount of slack is not a straightforward task . One approach we use at the Kansas City Fed is a \nLabor Market Conditions Index, which was developed by my staff . It summarizes a wide array \nof labor market data into two succinct statistics :  the level of labor market activity and the \nmomentum of that activity . The most recent reading for January showed a level of activity that \n\n3 \n was above the long-term average, and a momentum indicator that was the highe st level since the \nseries began in 1992 .  \nAnother important indicator of slack in the labor market is wage growth, which has been \nquite moderate since the financial crisis, though has increased over the past year . Despite the \nimprovement in overall wage growth, there are differences across sectors. Recent re search by my \nstaff shows that the increase in wag es has been driven by only a few industry segments  – namely, \nthe construction, manufacturing and wholesale sectors. Growth in hours worked in these sectors \nhas been moderating, even as wages rise, perhaps suggesting firms are having an increasingly \ndifficu lt time attracting new workers. On the other hand, wage growth has shown few signs of \nacceleration in many of the service  sectors , although growth in hours worked has been steadily \nincreasing . This suggests there may have been a modest amount of slack in some service  sectors, \nbut as economic growth continues , workers will  likely  become increasingly scarce. This “bottom \nup” approach to evaluating the labor market suggests further  wage pressure is likely to follow \nacross a broader range of industries.  \nAs labor markets continue to improve and economic activity expand s, we could see a bit \nmore  inflationary pressure. Currently the FOMC’s preferred measure of inflation , the personal \nconsumption expenditures (PCE)  price index,  has increased by 1. 6 percent over the last 12 \nmonths. This measure has risen notably, compared to about 0.6 percent a year ago, as the effe cts \nof lower oil prices  have waned . Looking past the se oil price  effect s, the core me asure of inflation \nis up 1.7  percent  over the past year.   \nOther measures of inflation show similar trends. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is up \n2.5 percent  over the past year, the Dallas Fed’s trimmed -mean PCE inflation rate over the past \n\n4 \n year is up 1.9  percent  and the Cleveland Fed’s weighted median CPI is up 2.5  percent . All these \nmeasures  point in the same direction:  Inflation remains low , but is rising .  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy R ules  \nThe current state of the economy stand s in sharp contrast to earlier phases of  the \nrecovery . Follow ing the crisis, the unemployment rate was persistently  above its longer -run \nnormal level and inflation  below the FOMC’s 2 percent  longer -run goal . At the risk of \noversimplify ing, central banks generally respond with mo netary accommodation to support \neconomic activity and achieve their mandated objectives  in these conditions . That is, the \nstandard approach is to lower interest rates .  \nWhile the policy prescription in such  circumstances is generally straightforward, a few \ncomplications come into play. The first is that monetary policy operates with lags, which is a \npoint highlighted in the FOMC’s annual “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy \nStrategy .” The timing and extent of a ny lags are imprecisely measured and can vary over time.  \nImportantly, these lags require monetary policy to act in a forward -looking manner. That is, \npolicymakers cannot wait to take action until they see  full employment and inflation at 2 percent . \nPolicy needs to be adjusted in advance.  Second, following the crisis, policymakers have become \nfar more attuned to the importance of fostering financial stability . While the relationship between \nmonetary policy and financial stability is not entirely clear, event s and research strongly suggest \nthat risk -taking often increases in low -rate environments . Indeed , the motivation for \nunconventional policies such as large -scale  asset purchases was aimed at provid ing additional \nstimulus at the zero lower bound by encouraging risk-taking , creating wealth effects , and \nboost ing asset prices . And third, policy needs to be set with a  sense of the risks surrounding the \n\n5 \n economic outlook . Foreign developments or financial  market volatility are examples of issues \nthat might cause policymakers to temporarily adjust course . Judging the scope and impact  of \nsuch risks is always  challenging , but this caution carries certain costs . Postponing rate \nadjustments is not unreasonable in the face of near-term risk s, but can keep policy stuck in place. \nThe result ing delay can leave a lasting imprint on the stance of monetary policy , especially  if \nadjustments are not made after the risk pass es. \nPolicymakers must deal w ith such complications . Among the tools available to us are \nmonetary policy rules, commonly known a s Taylor rules . These rules  provide guidelines for how \nto calibrate interest rates  under most economic conditions . How the FOMC should use such rules \nhas been the focus of some recent public discussion. In fact, the FOMC does consult the \nguidance coming from monetary policy rules  at each of its meetings . Rules come in many \nflavors , depending on what variables are included , the weights attached to  the different variables , \nand the designated value of the longer -run level of the funds rate. All of these make choosing a \nsingle rule difficult, but that’s not to say that they are not immensely useful. They may offer \ndifferent advice, but when all the ad vice moves in a particular direction, that is usually an \nimportant signal to policymakers.  \nWhile a variety of rules exist, t he intuition behind them  is relatively straightforward . \nMost rules take into account how far inflation is from the FOMC’s price sta bility target , as well \nas how far the labor market is from full employment . The deviation from their longer -run levels  \nis accounted for in the resulting rate prescription . When both numbers are close to their longer -\nrun levels, the se rules often prescribe that the federal funds rate should be near or be moving \ntoward its longer -run level . Indeed, most monetary policy rules today are pointing in the same \ngeneral direction and suggest short -term interest rates should be moving higher.  Given these \n\n6 \n signals , it may be a bit surprising that the FOMC has only raised its policy rate target twice since \nthe end of the financial crisis.  \n \nThe Path to the Longer -Run  \nWhile these p olicy  rules are prescrib ing higher short -term interest rates , the FOMC has \ndetermined that the path for raising rates will be a gradual  one. Part of the reason for a gradual \napproach is risk management. Moving too quickly could potentially risk slowing economic \nactivity , which obviously would not be an objective of monetary policy given current growth and \ninflation rates . A more rapid increase in short -term rates also could pose risks to financial \nstability  after an extended period of near zero rates . \nWhile I support th is gradual approach , the current readings for inflation and \nunemployment rel ative to the FOMC’s mandate d objectives  argue for more than just one move \nper year , as has been the case over the previous two years . This pace has left the current stance of \npolicy more accommodative than advocated by most policy rules and the funds rate well below \nits longer -run level, a discrepancy I see as important to  remedy in order  to preserve longer -run \nprice stability  and sustainabl e growth . \nIn considering the path to more normal interest rate settings, some have questioned \nwhether monetary policy is truly stimulative given that unusually low rates have not generated \nthe same kind of growth or inflation experienced in the past . One explanation is that certain \nfeatures of the economy may have changed , and that these changes are reflected in a measure \nknown as  the natural rate of interest. For example, short -term interest rates adjusted for inflation  \n– that is, real rates – have been n egative for many  years . When real rates are low, but the \neconomy is not growing rapidly, the  implication is that the  natural rate of interest is quite low. \n\n7 \n Although not observable,  movements in the natural rate  are presumed to occur gradually, \nsuggest ing current low level s will persist and result in a lower  longer -run federal funds rate than \nin the past. The implication of a lower natural interest rate would mean that today’s monetary \npolicy settings , although low by historical standards , might not be as stimulative as policy rules \nsuggest.  \nWhat would cause the economy to change in such a way ? There are likely any number of \nreasons, but one that seems plausible is that productivity growth has not been as strong as it was \nin previous decade s. Slower productivity growth, which has been an ongoing issue for the \neconomy  for some time , means the supply side of the economy also is grow ing more slowly. As \na result, moderate economic growth may be sufficient to absorb slack  and could  even cause the  \neconomy to outrun its potential . In fact, we see this today in some measures of what is called the \noutput gap , which captures the difference between th e level of economic activity and what the \neconomy can produce at full employment . For example, the Feder al Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco produces a measure of the output gap  and natural rate . They show that 2 percent \ngrowth the past few years has actually been higher than the economy’s potential and in fact, the \namount of economic activity is currently above  its potential level. These circumstances often \nlead to price pressures and higher inflation.  \nPulling the pieces together, then, how should monetary policy respond in a setting with a \nlow natural rate of interest and s low productivity growth, but with the economy growing  faster \nthan its potential? Again, we can glean insight from Taylor rules, which still would prescribe a \nhigher federal funds rate in the near -term to ensure economic activity does not too far exceed its \npotential capacity, but that  rate might top out at a level  below what we have seen in the past. \nThat is, the longer -run level of the funds rate could be lower than in previous decades.  \n\n8 \n The case for a much lower natural rate of interest seems plausible to me, but it puts a \ngreat deal of weight on estimate s that are subject to considerable uncertainty . History has shown \nthat deviating from long -run variables can increase risk to desired economic outcomes . My own \nview is that policy must still adjust from its current settings  in order to  “promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates” as \nspecified by the Federal Reserve Act . So while I see a gradual approach to raising rates as \nappropriate, I see more than one move per year , as h as been the case,  as needed to achieve the \nFOMC’s objectives .  \n \nConclusion  \nEconomic expansion over the past seven years has brought the labor market and inflation \nto levels consistent with the FOMC’s longer -run objectives . In this environment, p olicy rules  \npoint to higher rates, and there is reason to believe they are fairly signaling . To be sure, t he \noutlook for the economy does not call for tight policy by any means, but a gradual and deliberate \nmove to more normal rates is necessary  to limit the risk of creating imbalances and financial \nstability risks that could surface in undesirable ways."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNovember 18 , 2016  \nOil and the Economy: Adapting to a New Reality  \nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and Kansas City  \nHouston, Texas  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Feder al Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Thank you . I am pleased to join Rob Kaplan for this conference co-sponsored by the \nDallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve Banks.  The oil and gas sector features prominently in \nthe economies of our respective regions, making the focus of this conference “Adapting to a New \nReality” highly relevant to our work as policymakers . \nUnderstanding the dynamics of this market  is critical.  As such, we have long studied \ntrends in the sector  and how they affect economic and banking c ondition s.  As the shale boom \nintensified this decade , and the  oil and gas industry grew to its largest share of regional econom ic \nactivity since the early 1980s, we have devot ed more resources to understanding th is important \naspect of the regional , nation al and global economy .   Additionally, and importantly, we rely on \nbusiness contacts – nearly 80  percent of the energy companies in the Fortune 1000 are located in \nour two Federal Reserve Districts .  Some of these  companies are represented in our surveys, \nparticipate in roundtables and serve as directors on our boards  of directors .  This k ey input is \nessential to our understanding of the broader economy and an important contribution to our \npolicy deliberations.  \nIn my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about how regional insight feed s into policymakers ’ \nunderstanding of the national economy.  I’ll also offer my perspective on the outlook for the U .S. \neconomy and the current stance of monetary policy.   \nThese are my view s – not Rob’s , nor others within the Federal Reserve System .   \n \nInsights from Fed Regional Surveys  \nThe Federal Reserve ’s Beige Book provides  the public and Fed policymakers  with \nregional views on the economy eight times a year.  In addition,  as it pertains to energy,  the \nFederal Reserve Banks  of Dallas and Kansas City  conduct quarterly surveys of oil and gas firms  \n\n2 \n headquartered in our Districts .  The survey s gather  information on current business  activity, \ncapital spending plans , employment, price expectations , and other key indicators.   The most \nrecent results, for the third quarter of 2016, were somewhat encouraging , showing an expansion \nof business activity  and expectations for increased capital spending , but still slight reductions in \nemployment.  \nA particularly useful piece of information has been the price  of oil  that firms tell us they \nneed to be  profitable and also what prices they need to  substantially  increase drilling  activity .  \nWe’ve asked question s along these lines  in the Kansas City survey  since 2014.  At that time, the \naverage price needed to be profitable was $79/barrel.  Since then, with reductions in services \ncosts , as well as  advancements in technology and productivity , firms’ average profitab le price \nhas fallen by a third , to $53/barrel in third quarter  2016.  That price is still slightly higher than \nrecently prevailing prices, but not considerably so.  With the most recent range of profitable \nprices reported by firms ranging from $40 to $7 5/barrel , drilling is now profitable for some \ncompanies in some places, which is evident in the recent uptick in rig counts.   \nBut what will it take to substantially  increase drilling activity?  The most recent  \nresponse s to the Kansas City Fed survey noted  $64/barrel on average , and for the Dallas Fed \nsurvey it was $60/barrel, bo th well above recent oil prices , although  some firms reported needing \nonly $50/barrel to sizably increase drilling .  We also asked firms in the Kansas City District \nabout the prices needed to significantly increase natural gas drilling , and  the results were \nsimilar ly above current levels .  Firms on average needed $3. 65/mbtu, considerably  higher than \nrecent prices, although some firms did say they could significantly increase drilling for  as low as \n$3.00 /mbtu.  Taken together, these results suggest increased drilling activity  is likely to be \nrelatively moderate until prices reach a nd sustain a  higher level.  \n\n3 \n Another key source of information about the energy sector  comes from insights  provided \ndirectly by  oil and gas executives , as I mentioned earlier .   Both Reserve Banks have energy \nexecutives on our Boards of Directors , several of whom are with us today.  In addition to their \nbroad oversight of R eserve Bank operations, t heir specific knowledge of key aspects of the \nenergy sector , including  the real activity and the financial perspective , provides us with greater \ninsights than we are able to gather from our surveys.  We also regularly host individual meetings \nand roundtable discussions with oil and gas executives . Our ability to directly and immediately \ninteract with this important sector of the global economy is one example of the role regional \nFederal Reserve Banks play in monitoring current economic activity and understanding \nexpectations for future activity. This type of insight is an especially important contribution to the \nFederal Reserve’s policy deliberations and our understanding of the individual components that \ninfluence the broad  economy .  \n \nThe E nergy Sector and  Broader E conomic Activity  \nTurning to the broad economy,  even though oil prices have risen from the lows we saw \nearlier this year , they are still considerably  below their mid -2014 peak.  Not surprisingly, given \nthe important role of the energy sector  in this part of the country, the decline  in oil prices had a  \nnegative effect on economic activity  from a regional perspective .   \nWhat is surprising, though, is that the decline in oil prices did not provide a significant  \nboost to the national economy. Although declining oil prices  did support  consumer spending and \nsectors that are heavily reliant on energy , some researchers have concluded these  benefit s may \nhave been offset by a reduction in investment and employment in the energy sector .    \n\n4 \n In general, the positive and negative effects appear to be largely offsetting, which has \noften not been the case in years past. One obvious reason for the difference is that the size of the \nenergy sector has increased significantly, s o a decline in activity is large enough  today  to be \nnotable on a national scale. In early 2014, the U.S. mining sector, comprised primarily of oil and \ngas, accounted for 2. 8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), up from less than 1 percent \nin the l ate 1990s.  By early 2016, it had shrunk by about  half, to 1.2 percent of GDP . In terms of \nemployment, over 150,000  generally high -paying jobs have been lost in the U.S. oil and gas  \nsector since the fall of 2014, a decline of nearly 30  percent. There also have been thousands of \nassociated job losses in manufacturing, transportation, and other related sectors in energy -\nintensive areas of the country.  \nOn the demand side, it  is possible that  the benefits from lower oil prices are now  small er. \nFor example,  gasoline as a share of total consumption , has fa llen from about 4 percent in 1986 to \nabout 2 ¼ percent in 2015.  On net, today it does seem to be the case that the direct effects of oil \nprice swings are larger on the investment  and employm ent side, but  smaller on the consumer \nside. \nLooking forward, I continue to expect developments in the energy sector  to affect the \neconomic outlook.  If energy prices were to increase , then I would expect that new drilling \nactivities will expand, and the additional oil rigs will contribute to overall investment in \nstructures. While I now view business investment as being poised to make a modest contribution \nto growth over the medium -term, a potential retreat in energy prices  poses a downside risk. This \ncould occur if the OPEC deal expected at the end of the month does not materialize . \nIn terms of oil prices, I currently see the potential for new drilling activities within the \nU.S., as well as the potential to bring idle wells back online, which would alter the path of oil \n\n5 \n prices going forward. With a large amount of oil pr oduction ready to come online if prices were \nto advance through the mid -$50 range, I do not see as much room for price appreciation, \nespecially as global economic growth continues at a mode rate pace.   Among the anecdotes we’ve \nheard from directors and other executives this year is that there is a considerable amount of \n“money on the sidelines” looking to invest in oil and gas opportunities if prices continue to \nstabilize. This is despite som e of the profitability concerns that I noted  earlier , and may be \nreflective of a general “reach for yield” among investors, something we continue to monitor.  \n \nU.S. Economic Outlook  \nTurning to the national economic outlook , I continue to expect a moderate pace of \ngrowth, supported by consumer spending and stable business fixed investment. Consumers \ngenerally remain confident about the economy , and g oing forward, I expect continued job gains \nand increases in wages to support co nsumer spending . Overall, the labor market is near full \nemployment , and inflation is approaching the Federal Reserve’s 2  percent target . \nIndeed, over the past year we have seen a fast pace of growth in labor utilization that \nremoved a substantial amount of  labor market slack. For example, the U.S. economy added more \nthan 3 million people to the labor force since last September, which is the fastest pace of growth \nsince the year 2000. The additional workers joining the labor force in the past 12 months were \naccompanied by payroll growth that averaged 200,000 jobs per month, so that total employment \nhas grown by about 2.5 million jobs on net. With strong growth in the labor force accompanied \nby rapid employment, the jobless rate has remained at 4.9  percent , near my assessment of its \nnatural rate.  \n\n6 \n Although labor utilization has grown rapidly during the last year, the rising labor force \nparticipation rate does not suggest that a previously untapped group of workers has been pulled \nin from the sidelines. In fact,  since a year ago , the number of workers entering the labor force \neach month has remained flat, if not slightly  lower . Also , the number of people leaving the labor \nforce each month has fallen substantially. For example , the trend in the number of workers \nexiting the labor force each month fell from 6. 6 million to 6. 2 million  over the past year . These \ndevelopments indicate that workers are better attached to the labor force – that is, they appear \nless likely to get discour aged by spells of unemployment , and wage growth has encourage d them \nto remain active in the labor market.1  This attachment to the work force is a good sign . \nEven as labor markets have improved at a healthy pace, i nflation has been restrained , in \npart reflecting the downturn in oil prices.  Recently, these effects have begun to diminish.  As oil \nprices stabilized, inflation has increased from 0.2 percent to 1.3 percent over the past year .   \n \nMonetary Policy  \nConsidering  the rise in  the labor force participation  rate, increases in employment, and \nsigns of higher compensation, policymakers must judge what stance of monetary policy will \nsupport the substantial gains achieved in the last year  and keep the economy near its maximum \nsustainable employment level.  Interest rates have remained at historically low levels and the \nFederal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has signaled a gradual path toward more normal \nsettings.  At its most recent meeting,  the FOMC statement noted that the case for an increase in \nthe federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for \nsome further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.  \n                                                           \n1 Didem Tuzemen and Jon Willis , “What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor Force Participation? ” Macro \nBulletin , Nov. 14, 2016 . \n\n7 \n As a voting member of the Committ ee, I dissented in favor of a modest 25 -basis point  \nincrease.  My view is that monetary policy should avoid deliberately stoking the risks that come \nwith overheating the U.S. economy and instead, slowly raise the federal funds rate to promote \nmaximum emplo yment commensurate with the economy’s long -run potential to increase \nproduction.     \nSupporting conditions that bring more people into the workforce is certainly a desirable \nobjective.  However,  over the last 55 years, there have been occasions where the u nemployment \nrate has fallen below a  level that is consistent with the maximum  sustainable level  of \nemployment.  In these cases,  the U.S. economy soon after faced a period of substantial and \nprolonged increases in unemployment. The effect of allowing the eco nomy to overheat  in these \ncases  produced short -term gains, but ultimately with longer -term costs.   Consequently, I see \nmoving sooner, rather than later, as taking into account the long and variable lags with which \nmonetary policy operates, and reduces the potential for “go -stop” types of policies that create \nvolatility, rather than subdue it.  \n \nClosing  \nDecisions about monetary policy, of course, ultimately depend on how the U.S. and \nglobal economies unfold.  Understanding the effects of lower oil prices  is critical in this regard , \nand I look forward to the important insights and perspectives  to be explored at today’s \nconference."

I am pleased  to be with you today  to discuss the work of our \npayments coalition to improve the  speed, efficiency and security  of the U.S. payment  \nsystem .  \nWhen we began this work nearly two years ago, we understood it would be  \nchallenging . We set forth  ambitious outcomes that called for  a new and different \nenvironment  in which payments  could be made on mobile platforms, on any day , in real \ntime, and with the certainty that  the high est level of security would  protect both the \nsender and the recipient in the transaction . We also understood the  need to act \ndeliberately, but on  an aggressive schedule , because we saw countries around the world \nmoving swiftly  to develop their own  real-time payments infrastructure.  \nToday, I would like to spend  some time updating you on the progress of this \nwork . I’ll discuss the approach we have taken to facilitate this activity and provide some \ndetail about the work being done by both our Faste r Payments and Secure Payments Task \nForces . I’ll conclude with a few thoughts  on where their efforts are headed  and what to \nexpect in the year ahead , including some of the challenges we will face . \n \nThe Case  for Faster Payments in the United States   \nThe U.S. payment s ystem effectively supports the largest economy in the world, \nand has a long history of evolving to meet changing needs . In early 2015 , the Federal \nReserve issued a call to action in the form of a paper, titled Strategies  for Improving the \nU.S Payment System , that outlined the collective thinking of U.S. payment system \nstakeholders and the Federal Reserve on ways to  improv e the system.  \n\n \n2 \n The vision set out in the paper  framed specific strategies  designed to meet the \ngrowing demands of American consumers and businesses that continue to shift  their daily \ntransactions  toward e -commerce and Internet -enabled technologies . The strategies are \nbased on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following areas:  speed, security, \nefficiency, cross -border payments and industry collaboration . We also committed to \nmake improvements to the payment  services provided by the Federal Reserve .  \nAs the central bank of the U nited States, the Fed eral Reserve is  uniquely \npositioned to facilitate the stakeholder collabo ration needed to provide widespread access \nand the adoption of n ew payment system capabilities . For at least the last 50 years, \nmutual cooperation on payment issues between the Federal Reserve and the private sector \nhave contributed to a more resilient pay ment system , yielding significant benefits to the \npublic an d the economy as a whole.  \nTo be sure, t his approach has had its detractors , including those who thought that \nany attempt to produce significant change in our diverse payments landscape  would be \nhampered  by proprietary interests and a lack of cooperation . But that thinking \nunderestimated the interest and willingness of industry participants to cooperate and to \nproduce a result that none could achieve on their own .  \nOver the past two years , we have  brought together hundreds of interested parties \nand stakeholders in a broad and highly -motivated coalition that is working together to \nidentify both the promise and the challenges of making end-to-end payment system \nimprovements  a reality . \n \n \n\n \n3 \n Faster Paymen ts Task Force    \nCentral  banks around the world  have used government mandates  to provide the \ncontrol and direction needed to complete large -scale national initiatives  such as payment \nsystem  improvement . Here in the United States , the absence of a government  mandate \nand the recognition that significant  investments in legacy systems were in place , led to a \ndifferent approach .  \nThe Faster Payments Task Force now has more than 320 members comprising a \nvariety of interests:  technology providers; small, medium an d large financial institutions; \npayment networks; trade associations; business end users; and a small number of \ngovernment officials. Importantly, and in many respects u nique to such initiatives, the \nTask F orce also includes the representation of consumer groups .  \nThe Task F orce has made remarkable progress and I’d like to give you a sense of \nwhat has been accomplished . Early on, the Task F orce committed to a framework that \nwould ensure decision s and work products would have the broad support of its \nmembers hip, both within and across the various groups represented . With this \nunderstanding, they were able to define detailed criteria for judging the effectiveness \nneeded to deliver faster payments  and assess alternative approaches for faster payments \nsolutions .  \nIn January, the Task F orce created  a portal -based forum where solution providers, \nfrom  both the general public and within the Task F orce, c ould showcase their payment s \ncapabilities . In this w ay, firms intending to create  full end -to-end payment solu tions were \nable to view technologies and services that might help fill gaps in their proposals. To \ndate, more than 30 firms — from small startups to large payments and technology \n\n \n4 \n companies  — have submitted product descriptions or short videos to the online  forum, \noffering a range of expertise.  \nSoon after the creation of the capability showcase  forum , the Task F orce solicited \nproposa ls for faster payment solutions . Those making submissions  were asked to \nillustrate what their solution would do at each stage of the end -to-end payments process, \nfrom the initiation of a transaction through the completion of a payment and \nreconciliation of account balances. An outside consultant , McKinsey & Company , was \nchosen  to conduct an independent  assessment of each proposal against the criteria  \ndeveloped by the Task F orce.  \nIn total, 22  proposals have been reviewed  in the first phase of the assessment \nprocess that occurred from  May through September  of this year . Just last week , the \nproposals were released to both the Faster Payments Task Force and the Secure Payments \nTask Force , for review  and critical feedback . After receiving c omments , those who \nsubmitted the proposals will decide whether to remain in the process and release their \nproposal s to the general public. The proposals that remain will be included in  the Task \nForce’s Final Report  to be published in 2017 , along with t he assessment results and Task \nForce commentary.  \nBeyond the evaluatio n of individual proposals, the Task F orce review will \nconsider broadly the structural challenges that could affect the implementation of faster \npayments solutions . In a session later today, you’ll hear more about how the Task F orce \nis considering these issues , but let me share some of my views now  for the challenges to \nbe addressed .  \n\n \n5 \n Given the nature of market -driven solutions, interoperability will be a key \nconcern . This is  one of the current payments system gaps that led to establish ing the \nFaster Payments Task Force . Markets have produced a number of fragmented solutions \nthat deliver desired functionality, but have failed to deliver a ubiquitous and seamless \nexperience for end users .  \nInteroper ability requires a careful consideration of rules, standards and \ngovernance . We take for granted the ubiquity of our current infrastructure as represented \nin the use of debit and credit cards, ACH and check transactions . But, t he interoperability \nwe enjoy with these systems today didn’t happen ov ernight . In fact, it took years and in \nsome cases was cobbled together piece by piece across multiple providers . As we \ncontemplate faster p ayment capabilities for the United States , the industry has an \nopportunity to take a more proactive approach on these issues  and consider a path to \nadoption  so that all consumers and businesses may benefit from these capabilities .  \nProgress on bring ing faster payments to the U nited States  must  keep in focus the \nfundamental responsibility to ensure the overall  safet y and integrity of the payment \nsystem . Real-time payments present  some new risks in addition to those with which we \nare already familiar .  \nExperiences around the world and here in our own system prove that these risks \ncan be effectively managed and real -time payments can be safely and securely provided . \nHowever, the  challenges we face in successfully achieving our desired outcomes for \nfaster payments will require the same industry collaboration that has brought us to this \npoint . I commend the efforts of t he Task F orce to anticipate these challenges and \nopportunities , and I look forward to their recommendations in this regard.  \n\n \n6 \n Secure Payments  \nRegarding the issue of security, t here should be no doubt that d ynamic, persistent \nand escalating threats are  challe nging public confidence in the U.S. payment  system . The \ngrowing scale, sophistication, and global nature of cyber threats , along with the \nproliferation in points of vulnerability , has made security a key priority for fina ncial \ninstitutions, payments providers, central banks and regulators around the world . \nMore than 170 individuals joined t he Secure Payments Task Force  in 2015 to  \naddress the most pressing challenges in our existing payment systems and to defin e the \ncriteria for a safe and secure faster payments future . Let me hi ghlight two areas where \nthis Task F orce is focused today .  \nPreventing and managing fraud is a key challenge given certain inherent \nlimitations and weaknesses in existing payment systems  and processes . Today , there is no \nuniversally accepted way to establish and verify the identity of a payment system \nparticipant . The Task F orce has begun to address this problem . Their work will consider \nthe identification and adoption of payment identity management practices, as well as the \nopportunities to share fraud and cyber -threat information and how to analyze related  data.  \nThese efforts all promise to produce valuable information, tools and insight for \nthe industry . Driving widespread adoption of s ecurity improvements , however , remains a \nconsiderable challenge. Fortunately, U.S. payment  system security  is strong . And \nalthough we remain vigilant, we must keep pace with the rapidly -evolving and expanding \nrisks that threaten the payments ecosystem . I commend the work of the Secure Payments \nTask Force and the collaboration it brings to these important issues . \n \n\n \n7 \n Beyond Task Force Efforts  \nIn addition to the work of these Task Forces, the Federal Reserve itself is \ninvolved in improving efficiency in the p ayment system . Through its longstanding  \npartnership  with the Business Payments Coalition , real progress has been achieved in \nterms of educating small businesses on electronic payments, advancing the developme nt \nand adoption of standards, and understanding and addressing the barriers to straight -and -\nthrough processing. Of note this year is the establishment of the Business Payments \nDirectory Association, which is working to create a business -to-business directory to \nfacilitate easy, electronic origination o f business payments.  \nAnd in discussing our collective accomplishments in improving the payment \nsystem, the industry realized an important milestone last month  to enhance the speed of \nthe ACH network with implementation of the first phase of SameDay ACH . Within the \nFed, we’ve invested in speeding check clearing  and ACH payments, enhancing \nsettlement services, and enriching information services to better support risk and \ncompliance management needs. In partnership with the industry, we are working to alig n \nwire transfer and ACH systems to global message standards to meet user needs, pave the \nway for greater domestic and cross -border interoperability, and ensure a U.S. payment \nsystem that is relevant and competitive in the global market.   \n \nLooking Ahead  \nAfter almost two years, I am pleased at the progress we’ve mad e. We expect to \nmark some significant developments next year . In the first half of 2017, the Faster \nPayments Task Force is scheduled to issue its report in two parts . The first is expected to \n\n \n8 \n lay out the case for faster payments in the United States, and to describe the process \nundertaken to evaluate proposals for improvements . The second part of its report will \ninclude their review of the specific proposals  submitted . It will outline what an end -to-\nend faster payment system could look like in the U nited States  and discuss the possible \neffectiveness of different proposals , while highlighting strategic issues deemed important \nto the successful development of faster payments and actions needed to adva nce \nimplementation and adoption .  \nLikewise, the Secure Payments Task Force is likely to publish its views on the \nkey issues it has identified , including  payment identity management, information sharing, \ndata protection, and other payment system security is sues sometime next year .  \nThese reports will mark important milestones, but I believe o ur greatest challenge  \ngoing forward is maintai ning the momentum we have achieved  so far . It’s also likely that \nsome of our most difficult tasks lay ahead . Much of our collective work to date might be \ndescribed as identifying or designing solutions . We all know that in a market place as \ncomplex as our payment  system, the real work comes in driving successful \nimplementation and adoption all the way from the c entral infrastructures through the \nbanking and technology spaces to the hundreds of millions of consumers and business \nwho use these services .  \nAs some of these first steps in our payments improvement journey draw to a close \nor reach major milestones over the next year, we look forward to further collaborating to \ndivine the way forward toward our desired outcomes. The Fed’s priority in this important \ninitiative  has been  to advance and support improvements that are in the public interest \nand will contribute to long -term financial stability and economic growth . We remain \n\n \n9 \n committed to achieving those outcomes so that consumers and businesses have access to \nan efficient, real time and highly secure payment  network  in the Unite d States . \nThank you."

George  \nPresident  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \nbefore  the \nHouse  Subcommittee  on Monetary  Policy  and Trade  \nUnited  States  House  of Representatives  \n \nSept.  7, 2016  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  its \ngovernors,  officers  or representatives.  \n \n\n2 \n Chairman  Huizenga,  Ranking  Member  Moore  and members  of the subcommittee,  thank  \nyou for this opportunity  to share  my views  on the role of regional  Federal  Reserve  Banks  as part \nof the Federal  Reserve  System . \nBecause  the Federal  Reserve  is an institution  that makes  decisions  of consequence  to the \nbroad  public,  a discussion  of these  matters  is worthwhile.   If changes  are to be considered,  the \npublic  should  understand  not only the Congressional  intent  for its current  design,  but also the \nstrong  safeguards  that assure  its accountability.    \nCentral  banks  are unique  institutions.   They  have  impo rtant responsibilities  for a nation’s  \nfinancial  system  and economy.   Congress,  as it contemplated  a central  bank  for the United  States  \nmore  than 100 years  ago, took note of central  bank  models  from  other  countries,  while  keeping  \nin mind  two earlier  attempt s at central  banking  in the United  States.   Ultimately,  it opted  for a \ndifferent  approach:   one that recognized  the public’s  distrust  of concentrated  power  and greater  \nconfidence  in decentralized  institutions.   The Federal  Reserve’ s unique  public/private  structure  \nreflects  these  strongly -held views  and is designed  to provide  a system  of checks  and balances.   \nChallenges  to this public/private  design  have  surfaced  throughout  the Federal  Reserve’s  history,  \nnot unlike  they have  today.   But in the end, our country  has remained  most  confident  in this \ndecentralized  governance  structure.  \nCriticism  of the quasi -private  nature  of the regional  Reserve  Banks  was anticipated  from  \nthe start.   Indeed,  the Federal  Reserve  Act leaves  no unchecked  power  in Reserve  Banks.   The \npolitically -appointed  members  of the Board  of Governors  have  oversight  authority  of the most  \nimportant  governance  aspects  of Reserve  Banks.   For example,  they appoint  the Chair  and \nDeputy  Chair  of a Reserve  Bank’s  board;  they vote to approve  the selection  of the Bank’s  \npresident  as well as its chief operating  officer;  and they approve  the Reserve  Bank’s  budget  and \n\n3 \n salaries.    The Board  of Governors  also meets  with each Banks’  Chair  and Deputy  Chair  annually  \nto review  the Bank’s  performance  and that of its president.   Finally,  the Reserve  Bank’s  \noperations  are reviewed  by the Board  of Governors  and an outside  independent  auditor.  \nNotwithstanding  this strong  public  oversight,  some  question  the role of commercial  banks  \nwithin  the Fed structure.   Here  too, important  safeguards  exist.   The supervision  and regulation  \nof the Federal  Reserve’s  member  banks  is a statutory  responsibility  of the Congressionally - \nconfirmed  Board  of Governors.   Bankers  who serve  on Reserve  Bank  boards  are prohibited  by \nlaw from  participating  in the selection  of the Bank  president,  and no director  can participate  in \nbank  supervisory  matters.   Finally,  all directors  are required  to adhere  to high ethical  standards  of \nconduct  and avoid  actions  that might  impair  the effectiveness  of the Federal  Reserve’s  operations  \nor in any way discredit  the reputation  of the System.  \nThe capital stock supplied by these member banks serves as the foundation for the \ndecentralized structure allowing for separate corporate entities.   Through the regional Res erve \nBanks, private citizens from diverse backgrounds and from the largest to the smallest \ncommunities, have input into national economic policy; strong and varied independent \nperspectives more easily emerge to engage in difficult monetary policy discussio ns; and the \ncentral bank is provided insulation from short -term political pressures . \nAltering  this public/private  structure  in favor  of a fully  public  construct  diminishes  these  \ndefining  characteristics  in my view.   It also risks  putting  more  distance  betw een Main  Street  and \nthe nation’ s central  bank.    \nFormer  Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker  understood  this well.   He experienced  first-hand  how \npublic  pressure  can be exerted  on a central  bank  when  it must make  unpopular  decisions  that he \nand the FOMC  judged  to be in the long-run best interest  of the economy.   In a 1984  speech,  he \n\n4 \n noted  the important  role of the structure  of the Federal  Reserve  System  in supporting  the central  \nbank’s  decision  making  by saying , “It was all quite  deliberately  done  by men of political  \nimagination  -- designed  to assure  a certain  independence  of judgment,  a continuity  and \nprofessionalism  in staff,  a close  contact  with economic  developments  and opinion  throughout  our \ngreat  land and a large  degree  of insulation  from  partisan  or passing  political concerns.”1 \nTo that end, I extend  a personal  invitation  for any of you to visit the Federal  Reserve  \nBank  of Kansas  City to see what  a regional  Federal  Reserve  Bank  provides  in support  of the \ncentral  bank’s  objectives  for economic  stability.    Thank  you.  I look forward  to taking  your \nquestions.   \n \n                                                \n1 Paul A.

The Act also \nplaced a cap of $10 billion on the aggregate surpl us funds of the Federal Reserve  and directed \nthat any exces s be transferred to  the Treasury general fund. The potential policy implications of \nmodifying dividends to member banks, or more generally, the requirement for member banks to \npurchase stock in a regional Federal Reserve Bank , should be studied carefully before altering \nthis long -standing institutional design  of public and private interests serving the American \npublic .   \nIn designing the governance structure more than a century ago, Congress accepted a \ncompromise proposal from President Woodrow Wilson to create a central bank with a combined \npublic and private structure with those roles filled respectively by the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System and the regional Reserve Banks. In this design, the st ock ownership of \nthe regional Reserve banks is a key component in a central bank design that provides representation for both the public and private interests with each acting as a potential limit on the \ncontrol of the other.  \nThe debate regarding the role of Federal Reserve stock in the Federal Reserve System \nstructure  is not a new one : In 1938, Congressman Wright Patman proposed that the government \nshould take over the Reserve Bank stock, effectively turning the r egional Reserve Banks into full  \ngovernment entities. At the heart of this issue is whether changes that aim to alter the \nprivate/public status of the central bank and potentially nationalize  the 12 regional Federal \nReserve Banks  could undermine the barriers carefully constructed by Congress to protect against \npolitical pressures on Federal Reserve policies .   \nThis analysis  offers historical perspective on these issues, as well as an  assessment of the \neffectiveness of the current governance and structure of the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nA LOOK BACK ON CENTRAL  BANKING IN THE UNITE D STATES  \nA careful reading of Federal Reserve history will find that proposals for increased \ngovernment authority over the Federal Reserve are often raised most pointedly during periods \nwhen government debt is high. Pressure on the Federal Reserve to implement policy supportive \nof government spending dates back almost to the 1913 founding of the Federal Reserve and the \n\n2 \n subservient role the Federal Reserve soon assumed related to government financing demands in \nconnection with World War I. Similar pressure continued during and after World War II. \nEventually, the Federal Reserve’s resistance to continually supporting gover nment spending led \nto a formal accord with the Treasury in 1951.  \nThe list of events that have occurred in these environments is long and includes such \nhigh-profile instances as pressure from President Lyndon Johnson to hold rates low as a means \nof support ing his proposals during the Vietnam War to calls for Federal Reserve Chairman Paul \nVolcker’s resignation during the Federal Reserve System’s successful, but painful, battle against high inflation. Beyond these major events, numerous legislative initiative s have met varying \ndegrees of success over the years but have overa ll led to what Duke University economics \nprofessor Thomas Havrilesky termed the “deterioration of traditional constraints on the political \nmanipulation of monetary policy” since the modern F ederal O pen M arket Committee (FOMC)  \nwas created in 1935.\n1   \n \nThe Failure  of Earlier Central Bank Designs  \nAt the time of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the U nited States  had already witnessed \ntwo unsuccessful attempts at establishing a central bank . Neither was able to outlast their initial \n20-year charter.  \nThere was intense political debate around the creation of both the First Bank of the \nUnited States , in 1791, and its successor, the Second Bank of the United States, in 1816. While \nrecogniz ing the n eed for the stability that a central bank could provide, many Americans with \nvivid memories of the fight to win independence from England were understandably leery of \ncreating another powerful institution. As a result, both the First and Second Banks were the focus of significant public distrust.  Both were h ighly centralized institutions that many Americans \nviewed as too closely aligned with powerful political and financial interests of the Northeast.  In \nthe early 1900s, after a series of financial cris es, a third effort was launched to create a central \nbank with a structure that com bined both government and private interests .  \nCarter Glass, the House sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act and the legislation’s key \nauthor, explained the challenges in a report to the 63\nrd Congress:  \n                                                \n1 T. Havrilesky, “ The Politicization of Monetary Policy: The Vice Chairman as the Administration’s Point Man .” Cato Journal , \nVol. 13, No. 1 (Spring/Summer 1993) . Copyright Cato Institute.  \n\n3 \n “In the United States, with its immense area, numerous natural divisions, still \nmore competing divisions, and abundant outlets to foreign countries, there is no \nargument either of banking theory or expediency which dictates the creati on of a single \ncentral banking institution, no matter how skillfully managed, how carefully controlled or how patriotically conducted.”  \nAs Glass’s comment suggests, the concern about centralization was not something that \ncould be addressed solely by geogra phy or the number of bank facilities. Nor was it simply a \nquestion about adjusting the bank’s ownership structure. While both of those are elements of a \ndecentralized structure, arguably the most important issue —and the glaring weakness of both the \nFirst and Second Bank— was the centralization, or the perceived centralization, of control. \nIndeed, both the First and Second Banks  were geographically diverse with branch offices \nlocated in the important financial centers of their eras. Additionally, both had a combined public/private ownership;  however , the ownership structure utilized in each case was problematic \nfor two key reasons:  the need for profits, and the homogeneity of ownership and centralization of \ncontrol. \n \n• The Risks of a Structure that Requires Profits  \nAlthough the nation’s first two central banks had slight differences, particularly in \ntheir size, they were alike in many key structural ways. In both cases, private investors held \nan 80 percent ownership stake while the government held the remaining 20 percent. Investors \nacquired their shares th rough an initial public offering (IPO) process that was  similar to other \npublic stock offering s. In the case of both banks, the IPO involved the immediate sale of \nsubscriptions, or “scrips,” that were essentially a down payment for a later stock purchase. \nScrip and stock purchases for the First Bank, which required the combined use of specie \n(gold or silver) and U.S. debt securities to complete the transaction, created what is now \nconsidered the nation’s first financial crisis when scrip prices soared on hi gh demand, \ncausing debt markets to become distorted. While this  distortion and the resulting U.S. \nfinancial  crisis was an early indication of one of the many potential risks in a profit -seeking \ncentral bank structure, the era’s more prominent international  example involved the \nprivately -held French central bank , Banque de France, which took actions in the 1880s to \n\n4 \n protect and increase profits —moves that had a negative impact on its effectiveness as a \ncentral bank.     \n \n• The C onsequences of a Homogeneous Leade rship S tructure  \nShares for both the First and Second Banks  were prohibitively expensive for most \nAmericans. Stock in the First Bank, for example, was initially offered at $400 per share ( the \nequivalent of about $10,000 in 2016 after accounting for inflation ). Stock in the Second Bank \nwas still pricey at about a quarter of that cost. As a result, U.S. central bank ownership was \nvested primarily in the hands of wealthy and powerful individuals (including —perhaps \nunexpectedly —a number of foreign invest ors). Similarly, the majority of the directors of the \nFirst and Second Banks  were elected from the ranks of the politically and financially \npowerful, including some members of Congress, who lived in and did business in the \nnation’s power centers. The lack of diversity of central bank leadership was a major criticism, especially from those living outside of the East Coast.   \n \nThe C ombination of Public and Private Components: Checks and Balances  \nEconomic historians sometimes note that the fundamental issue about a U.S. central bank \ncorrelates with the fundamental issue dividing America’s two chief political ideologies: the role \nof government versus the role of the private sector.  \nAt the time of the Fed eral Reserve’s founding, most of the world’s other centr al banks \nwere privately held institutions. In the United States , the Federal Reserve ’s congressional \ncreators recognized that a private structure would not work and instead devised a structure with checks and balances between the private sector and the gov ernment.\n2 \nBalancing  government authority over the central bank was  not solely about placating \npolitical ideologies that preferred  limited government. The primary motivation was to avoid the \nuse of monetary policy and inflation as the means of financing government debt. Related to this  \nconcern , of course, wa s the risk of Federal Reserve policy manipulation for political gain.  \n                                                \n2 T. Todd, The Balance of Power: The Political Fight for an Independent Central Bank, 1790 -Present , Federal R eserve Bank of \nKansas City, 2009 . \n\n5 \n To address concerns about national debt funding, the Federal Reserve Act expressly \nprohibited the direct financing of the Treasury. However, since  the Fed eral Reserve’s founding, \npolitical pressure to ease monetary policy  has surfaced .3  \nTo mitigate this  political pressure, the Fed eral Reserve’s creators made the Reserve \nBanks private entities  under the supervision and control of a board of directors with authority to \nperform all duties usually pertaining to directors of a banking association. This includes the \nappointment of the president and first vice president (directors affiliated with supervised entities \nare no longer involved in this process) , appointment of officers, prescribing by -laws, and \ndesignat ing a representative for the FOMC. As initially designed, the Reserve Banks were far \nmore autonomous  than they are today . While the Fed eral Reserve System ’s government \ncomponent has always been responsible for Reserve Bank  oversight, the Federal Reserve ’s key \nfunctions, including monetary policy, were under the purview of the Reserve Banks during the System ’s early history. Over time, the monetary policy function has become balanced between \nthe private and public components  with the Board of Governors holding the majority votes.  T he \nFOMC co nsists of 12 members :  seven members of the Board of Governors  and five Reserve \nBank presidents .   \n \nPrivate Sector Involvement  \nWhile private sector involvement through a network of separate and distinct  Reserve \nBanks located across the country expanded  leadership diversity  and help ed balance government \nauthority, on the surface it present ed another problem: how to engage the private sector while \npreventing risks associated with a pure -profit motivation. This aspect was addressed by putting \nrestrictions  on Reserve Bank stock  and establishing the Board of Governors ’ authority for \noversight of  the Reserve Banks . \nWhile  law requires stock ownership in Federal Reserve Banks as a condition of a \ncommercial bank’s membership in the Federal Reserve System , this stock is not like stock \navailable on public markets . It may not be sold, traded or pledged as security for a loan. It does \npay a dividend rate that is established by statute and, as a result, cannot be manipulated through \nthe use of Fed eral Reserve policy tools or otherwise. This design provides the Fed eral Reserve \n                                                \n3 T. Todd, Under Pressure: Politics and The Federal Reserve During the 1990 -1991 Recession , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas \nCity, 2011 . \n\n6 \n System  with private ownership over the Reserve Banks, but without the profit motivation that \ncan distort policy.  \nStock ownership allows member banks to nominate and elect Class A and B directors  to a \nReserve Bank’s Board of Directors .  However, unlike traditional corporations which grant one \nvote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member bank \nreceives one vote as a member of one of three designated classes based on the t otal amount of \ncapital, surplus  and retained earnings of the member bank. There are further limitations on voting \nas each class elects only one Class A and one Class B director.    \nIn addition to these restrictions on Reserve Bank stock, the B oard of Governors plays an \nimportant oversight role , including its authority to:  \n• Examine at its discretion the account s, books  and affairs of each Reserve Bank ; \n• Suspend or remove any officer or director of a Reserve Bank ; \n• Order an annual independent audit of the financial statements of each Reserve \nBank ; \n• Approve compensation provided by Reserve Banks to dir ectors, officers, and \nemployees;  \n• Approve the president and first vice president appointed by the Reserve Bank \nClass B and C directors ; and  \n• Appoint three of the nine Reserve Bank directors, including the  Reserve Bank’s  \nchair and deputy chair . \n \nMEMBER BANKS  HELP RESERVE BANKS F ULFIL L THEIR MISSION  \nStockholders of the Federal Reserve System, also referred to as members, have some \nrights and obligations simila r to traditional corporate stockholders  in that they provide capital to \nthe Federal Reserve Banks , which are federally -chartered corporations . All national banks along \nwith state -chartered banks that choose the Federal Reserve as the bank’s primary federal \nregulator  are required to purchase Federal Reserve stock . By purchasing stock, members are \nentitled to a dividend fixed by statute as well as a role in Reserve Bank governance .4 Members \n                                                \n4 The dividend rate was set to 6 percent in the original 1913 Federal Reserve Act to provide a rate of return comparable  to \nalternative risky investments and to attract sta te-chartered banks as members. Investing in the Federal Reserve in 1913 was not \nrisk-free given that the previous two central banks in the United States had not survived and the short -term ability to pay a steady \ndividend was unclear. Today, however, Federal Reserve stock is essentially a risk -free perpetual bond as long as a bank chooses  \n\n7 \n are therefore  invested in the Reserve Banks’ and Federal Reserve System’s success and are \nintegral to the Federal Reserve’s mission. Member banks must buy stock in the Federal Reserve \nBank equal to 6 percent of the bank’s capital, 3 percent of which is held at the regional Reserve \nBanks . The other 3 percent is callable by the Bank in certain circumstances. Paid -in capital from \nmember banks was the initial funding mechanism for the Federal Reserve Banks, and the 3 percent on call remains available in the event it is needed by the Reserve Banks.  \n \nRole of M ember Banks  in Governance of Reserve Bank Activities  \nStockholding member banks elect  a portion of the Reserve Banks’ director seats,5 are \ncore to Reserve Bank corporate governance  and provide critical industry information and \nperspective on economic and banking conditions . At the same time, the structure includes shared \noversight with the politically appointed Board of Governors that prevents members from having undue influence on Federal Reserve System activities.  \nThe Federal Reserve Act states that every Reserve Bank “shall be conducted under the \nsupervision and control of a board of directors ,” and provides that t he nine director positions of \nthe Reserve Bank’s board of directors are filled through two met hods: election and appointment \n(12 U.S.C. 301). Only three of the nine directors on a Reserve Bank’ s board may be officers, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nto remain a member. While the dividend remained unchanged for over a century, analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center found \nit was similar to the average return on the 10 -year U.S. Treasury note over that period (A. Klein, K. Readling, O. Weiss, A. Woff; \n“Federal Reserve Dividends Should Not Be a Piggy Bank for Congress .” Bipartisan Policy Center, 2015). The Fixing America’s \nSurface Transportation Act, 129 Sat. 1312 (“FAST Act”), effective Jan . 1, 2016, changed the dividend for stockholder banks with \nmore tha n $10 billion in total con solidated assets from a fixed 6 percent rate to a di vidend equal to the lesser of 6 percent  or the \nrate equal to the high yield of the 10-year Treasury note auctioned at the last auction held prior to the payment of the dividend.  \nThe 10-year Treasury bond rate is seen by some as a reasonable alternative because it is the benchmark risk -free rate used for \nmost long -term , fixed -rate investments and has a long history of continual issuance. The 30-year Treasury rate might also be an \noption because it is the longest maturity Treasury rate, but there is a risk that the Treasury could decide to stop issuing i t at some \npoint as it did from late 2001 to early 2006.   \n If a market rate is used as a reference rate, it should not be capped at  6 percent as it currently is for member banks with more than \n$10 billion in assets . Using a market rate only when it is below a threshold is economically inconsistent with the notion of tying \nreturns to the market, and it is inequitable to penalize member  banks when r ates rise above the threshold. In addition, changing \nthe dividend has raised questions about the appearance of\n breaking an agreement with members. The American Bankers \nAssociation asserts that the FAST Act’s dividend rate change amounts to an unconstitutional taking of member banks’ property \nwithout compensation.  See Letter dated April 28, 2016 from Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers \nAssociation, to Robert de V. Frierson, secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Attachment B).  An \nalternative would be to allow current members to retain the 6 percent dividend or elect the 10 -year Treasury rate and issue a new \nclass of stock for new members with the dividend tied to the 10-year Treasury rate.  \n \n5 Class A and B  directors are nominated and elected by member banks within their respective Federal Reserve District. Unlike \ntraditional corporations , which grant one vote per share, the Federal Reserve Act provides for class voting wherein each member , \nregardless of shares,  receives one vote as a member of one of three classes . The classes are designated based on the t otal amount \nof capital, surplus  and retained earnings of the member bank  within the class . Not every class votes each year, and each group \nwithin the class elects one Class A and one Class B director.    \n\n8 \n direct ors or employees of a bank. Those directors (Class A) are cho sen to represent member \nbanks. The remaining six directors (Class B and Class C) cannot be bankers, and are chosen to \nrepresent the public with “due but not exclusi ve regard to agriculture, commerce, industry, \nservices, labor and consumers” ( 12 U.S.C. 302). While member banks nominate and elect the \nClass A and Class B directors, this Reserve Bank’s staff plays an important role in considering \nrepresentation from local and regional organizations to identify  qualified candidates. Likewise, \nClass C directors are identified b y Reserve Bank leadership with appoint ment  by the Board of \nGovernors. The chair and vice c hair of the Reserve Bank board of directors must be selecte d \nfrom the Board of Governor s-appointed Class C directors. Reserve Bank directors come from \ndiverse backgrounds in the region and across industries . They m ust comply with legal \nrequirements and rules related to their eligibility and conduct.  \n \nBenefits of Banker  Directors  \nReserve Bank s are nationally chartered banks that serve as the operating arms of the \ncentral bank.  They function much like a banker’s bank or a clearing house. As such, banker directors ’ knowledge  of the payments system  complements the Reserve Bank s’ operational role \nin providing financial services to the industry . Indeed, corporate best practices recognize that \n“the key to effective board composition is ensuring that the people gathered around the board \ntable can leverage their experience to contribute in meaningful ways, to understand the issues, \nask the right questions, demand the right information, and make the best possible decisions.”\n6  \nClass A directors bring informed views related to banking, as well as to the industries of their \ncustomers, and act as consolidators of information. For instance, a banker director can provide \ndetails about lending trends , stresses in the financial system,  and other banking metrics, in \naddition to sharing insights into farming, commercial real estate, h ousing  and the auto industry. \nTheir reports at Reserve Bank board meetings offer input to economic analysis used by Res erve \nBank presidents  for monetary policy . \n \nLimitations  to Banker Influence  \nWhile Reserve Bank directors have important oversight responsibilities for the operation \nof their respective Reserve Bank, they have no involvement in the Federal Reserve’s supervision \n                                                \n6 D. Nadler, B. Behan, and M. Nadler, Building Better Boards  (Jossey -Bass 2006).   \n\n9 \n of depository institutions . By law, the Board of Governors of the Feder al Reserve System is \nresponsible for the supervision and regulation of banks , and any information or discussion \nrelated to supervisory issues is conducted directly between a regional Reserve Bank’s staff and \nthe Board of Governors . In addition, any supervi sory matter regarding a Class A director’s bank \nis handled by  the Board of Governors.  \nReserve Banks may not provide confidential supervisory information to any director ( 12 \nC.F.R. 261.2). Moreover, Reserve Bank directors may not participate in bank supervisory matters and may not be consulted regarding bank examination ratings, potential enforcement \nactions, application/approval matters, or similar supervisory matters. In regard to the Reserve \nBanks’ lending activity involving financial institutions, direc tors receive only aggregate \ninformation about loans extended  to ensure adequate knowledge of the Reserve Bank’s balance \nsheet per their oversight responsibilities.  Finally, i f a banker director wants to convert his or her \nbank to Federal Reserve membership or take any other actions that would involve Federal Reserve regulatory approval, the Board of Governors in Washington must act on the application \nwithout  Reserve Bank  invol vement .  \n \nStatutory and Policy Restraints  \nThe directors representing member banks are subject to other  restraints by statute and \nthrough System policy. As noted above , only Class B and Class C directors appoint, subject to \napproval by the Board of Governors, the Reserve Bank president and first vice pr esident. Class A \ndirectors are excluded from that process to eliminate the perception that they have a rol e in \nchoosing their regulator. Class A directors also are prohibited from participatin g in the selection, \nappointment  or compensation of Reserve Bank officers whose primary duties involve \nsupervision of banks for the same reason.   \nAll directors  are subject to the Guide to Conduct for Directors of Federal Reserve Banks \nand Branches , a policy implemented to ensure adherence to high ethical standards of conduct, \nand avoid actions that might impair the effectiveness of Federal Reserve System operations or in \nany way discredit  the reputation of the System. The policy details procedures when directors are \ninvolved in procurements as a means to avoid any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.  Further, while the policy allows for w aivers, it indicates waivers  are both highly unlikely and \n\n10 \n strongly discouraged except under the most exigent and extraordinary circumstances. This \nReserve Bank has never sought a waiver for a director.  \n CONCLUSION \nAltering the current structure and c haracter of the Federal Reserve System risks \ndiminishing the effectiveness of its o perations . \nFor more than a century, the structural design of the Federal Reserve System has \nfunctioned well in carrying out its mandates from Congress. It is possible that Reserve Banks \ncould operate as separate corporate entities without stock ownership, but altering the central banks ’ current design creates the potential to diminish its effectiveness.   \n• The private nature of the Reserve Banks through stock issuance to member banks \nprovides balance to the public  nature of the Board of Governors.  The public’s trust \nand confidence is enhanced by this “balance of power .”  \n• Requiring stock purchases through capital investment creates incentives for member \nbanks to s upport  success ful outcomes for the Reserve Banks .   \n• Rather than a Washington -centric voice for the Federal Reserve System, the \nstructure of 12 separate Reserve Banks encourages strong and varied perspectives \nfrom across the country as the System fulfill s its mission.   \n• The structure of the Reserve Banks as separate corporate entities allows private \ncitizens  from communities across the country to have input into national economic \npolicy.   \n• The current decentralized structure insulates the Federal Reserve System from certain political p ressures, as the Reserve Bank presidents are not political \nappointments, but instead chosen by Class B and Class C directors, with appr oval \nby the Board of Governors. \n \nNationalizing the Reserve Banks, and thereby making them essentially field offices of the \nBoard of Governors , would dramatically alter these defining characteristics."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 12, 2016  \nBusiness and Community Leaders Luncheon  \nAlbuquerque, N.M.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n I’m pleased to be in Albuquerque  with our Kansas City and Denver office boards \nof directors.   \n As a regional Federal Reserve Bank president, I gain important insights about the \nregional and national economy from visits like this one , where I have the opportunity to \nmeet with b usiness and community leaders. Their perspectives and concerns, combined \nwith economic data and analysis, help shape my own views on monetary policy.   \n In my remarks today, I’ll talk about the economic issues we see  in New Mexico \nand the nation. I’ll also note the current stance of interest rate policy, and why, as a \nvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee  this year, I have argued that \ninterest rates should gradually return to more normal levels.  Before I continue, however, I \nwant to note that these are my own views and are not necessarily representative of others \nin the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe New Mexico Economy  \nNew Mexico has stru ggled to recover from the  recession  that ended nearly seven \nyears ago . Although employment has increased , the gains have been modest and  held \nback by several factors . First, the cons truction sector was slow to bounce back after the \nsevere downturn in the housing sector. The crisis left the state with high inventory  levels  \nand sharply lower prices. Then, austerity measures at the federal government level led to \ncutbacks that were sharp ly felt here . As neighboring states recovered  more quickly , New \nMexico saw workers move out of the state , exacerbating its challenges.  \nOver the past year, new concerns have emerged and growth has slowed once \nagain. Parts of the state that had been doing quite well are now facing sharp declines in \n\n2 \n activity due to weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors. Employment in the energy \nsector has declined 26 percent in New Mexico over the past year, and weakness is \nstarting to spread to related industries, with the transportation and wholesale trade sectors \nalso reporting employment losses. The drop in energy activity is also starting to wei gh on \nstate and local finances, which can lead to government spending cuts that can further \nweigh on  employment.  \nAt the same time, there are other sectors and areas of the state that are doing \nbetter . Employment growth in Albuquerque recently reached its fastest pace since mid -\n2013, and outside of energy and agriculture -dependent areas, it appears that the recovery \nis accelerating. Home inventor y levels have dropped significantly in the metro area, home \nprices have stabilized, and residential construction activity is finally picking up. The \nhealthcare sector  also continues to expand and tourism activity has picked up over the \npast couple of years. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to visit the Sandia Peak Tramway \nand the Anderson Abruzzo International Balloo n Museum with our Kansas City and \nDenver Branch Board s of Directors. We heard about the robustness of the tourism \nindustry in the state and the wonderful Balloon Fiesta that takes place here each fall. \nThen, this morning , we heard about another growing sec tor in the New Mexico economy \n—entrepreneurship.  \nOverall, h ealthcare, tourism, construction and entrepreneurship are po ised to drive \ngrowth in the Albuquerque area, though softness in  the energy, agriculture, and state and \nlocal government sectors  will li kely remain for some time .   \n \n \n\n3 \n The U .S. Economic Outlook  \n You may ask how the economic developments facing New Mexico fit into the \nlarger regional , as well as  national , picture. Throughout the Tenth  Federal Reserve \nDistrict, which covers  seven states, the fall in commodity prices ha s been a major \neconomic shock. While t he rece nt increase in the price of some  commodities offers a bit \nof relief, there is little doubt that lower prices will require some major adjustments. For \nexample, energy production will li kely continue to decline and workers in the sector will \nneed to look to other industries that are doing better, such as construction. In addition, the \nmanufacturing and export sectors have been contracting, reflecting both the decline in \nenergy activity an d the strong dollar.  \nEven as these sectors of our economy  face strains, other aspects of the regional \nand national economy show more robust growth. In fact, t he U.S. economy has proven \nitself to be quite resilient in recent years , and I expect the moderat e pace of growth \nexperienced during this recovery will continue. Granted, the economy is subject to some \nshort -term ups and downs . We saw GDP growth was rather weak during the first quarter, \nbut the growth rate over the past year is near 2 percent —a pace that is close to the \naverage during this recovery. More importantly, employment growth has remained \nstrong . The economy has added close  to 200,000 jobs on average each month  this year.  \nThe longer -term pace of job growth has also been quite robust . As a result, the \nunemployment rate currently stands at about 5  percent , compared to 10  percent  after the \nfinancial crisis in 2009 .  Of course, t he unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of the \nlabor market, so I also pay close attention to other data. For example, o ne development I \nfind promising is that many individuals who had dropped out of the workforce are finding \n\n4 \n jobs. After the crisis, the percentage of people participating in the labor market fell \nsharply. Some of this is because our population is aging, so people naturally work less as \nthey get older. However, some of the decline in labor force participation was due to \nworkers being discouraged about their job prospects. More recently , however, we have \nseen an upswing in people finding jobs who had previously stopped looking for one. For \nexample, close to 2 million workers return ed to the labor force over the past six months . \nThis pace of re -entry is close to the fastest pace in more th an 15 years.  \nDespite these positive developments,  wage growth has remained sluggish  and \nmany people still feel like they have limited options in the labor market.  That being the \ncase, let me spend some time on the labor market.  \n \nLabor Market Trends From Tw o Perspectives  \n As I travel around my region to meet with business, community, and labor \nleaders, I often hear the m describe the job market from two very different perspectives. \nOne perspective is of a booming labor market, rising wages and an abundance of \nopportunity. The other perspective is of stagnant wage growth, limited upward mobility \nand job insecurity.  \n How can these different views be reconciled? Looking at  general labor market \ndata, we have seen a steady improvement in employment over the past seven  years. In \nfact, 14 million net new jobs ha ve been created since the crisis . Along with an \nunemployment rate that is cur rently near normal , the economy appears to be close to full \nemployment. As a result , many business leaders  often discuss the challenge of  hiring \nworkers with the right skill s and say that numerous job openings remain unfilled. In fact , \n\n5 \n there are currently around 5. 8 million job openings in the U nited States,  which is near the \nhighest level on record. I often hear about the need to raise wages rapidly to retain these \nworkers, and as a result, the national data showing slow wage growth doesn’t ring true to \nmany business leaders.  But while this aspect of job growth looks  pretty good, there are \nunderlying trends that suggest that the recovery has not been evenly spread across all \ntypes of workers.  \nThe other perspective on labor market developments reflects a trend that has been \npresent over the past three decades. In particular,  the share of workers in middle -skill jobs \nhas fallen sharply. For decades, these jobs were the bedrock professions of the middle \nclass . If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle -skill jobs that were much more \nprevalent than today include assembly -line manufacturing jobs , clerical and \nadministrative position s.  \nThe steady d ecline in these types of jobs is not a new story. However, demand for \nboth higher -skilled and lower -skilled workers is growing  faster  relative  to middle -skilled \nworkers . This employment phenomenon is called “job polarization.”  In 1983 , nearly 60 \npercent of all jobs wer e in middle -skill occupations. By 2016, that sha re has declined to \n44 percent. By current employ ment levels, this would be equivalent to a shift of 22 \nmillion jobs away from middle -skill occupations toward both high - and low -skill \noccupations.     \nThe decline in middle -skill jobs is the result of  a number of sweeping changes \naffecting the economy. With the adoption of computers and advanced technologies, \nbusinesses have fundamentally changed the way they operate and the types of workers \n\n6 \n that they require. At the same time , the rapid increase in globalization has provided new \nopportunities for some c ompanies , while increasing competition for others .  \nManufacturing , for instance , is a sector that has historically demanded a large \nnumber of middle -skilled jobs . However , both global forces and technological advances  \nhave had a profound effect on manufact uring employment . Today , fewer than 10 percent \nof workers in the U nited States  are employed in the manufacturing sector  compared to \nmore than 20 percent in 1980.  These trends are unlikely to reverse , and continued \ntechnological innovations will likely broaden their reach into both higher - and lower -\nskilled jobs.  \nThe dramatic shifts tied to job polarization offer some expla nation as to  why \nmany people feel that their economic prospects haven’t improved . On average, salaries \nfor middle -skill jobs are close to the m edian income for all workers.  As opportunities for \nworking in a middle -skill job, and thus a middle -class lifestyle, have dwindled, workers \nhave increasingly been faced with a choi ce between two distinct paths. For workers who \nacquire  the education and training required for high -skill jobs, they have the opportunity \nto pursue employment in jobs that typically pay 50 percen t more than the median salary. \nBut for those workers who do n ot have the needed training and skills, their options are \nincreasingly shifting toward low -skill jobs that typically pay 50 percent below the median \nsalary.  \nUnderstanding t hese trends helps to reconcile the two versions of the la bor market \nI described earl ier. Busine ss leaders trying to develop  new businesses and technologies \nrequire high -skilled workers, which remain in short supply . Alternatively, the m illions of \n\n7 \n other workers in traditional middle -skill occupations  may not have the option of spending \nmonths, or years, to update their skills . These workers  face insecurity  about their career .  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy  \n As the Federal Reserve considers these and other economic trends , it must weigh \na number of crosscurrents  to determine the appropriate interest rate policy . In the short -\nrun, I continue to monitor how the energy, agricultural and manufacturing sectors are \nadjusting relative to the national economy. And o ver the longer -run, I evaluate what \ntrends like job pola rization mean for monetary policy. These are challenging questions \nwith no easy answers.  For the most part,  monetary policy is limited in the support it can \noffer any particular sector. It is also limited in its ability to affect trends like job \npolarizati on.  \nInstead, monetary policy has the broad goals of promoting stable prices, full \nemployment, and moderate long -term interest rates . Since the crisis, conditions have \nimproved sufficiently that the  FOMC  deemed it appropriate to raise the  target range for \nthe federal funds rate by 25 basis points  last December. This was a significant step, as it \nwas the first increase in short -term interest rates sinc e the middle of 2006. No further \nadjustments have occurred this year, as the FOMC  weighs e conomic developments and \nmonitors risks to the outlook . The current setting for the federal funds rate is well below \nwhat the FOMC  expects will prevail in the longer  term. T he plan is to move gradually \nand in a way that is responsive to economic developmen ts.  \nI support a gradual adjust ment  of short -term interest rates toward a more normal \nlevel , but I view the current level as too low for today’s economic conditions.  The \n\n8 \n economy is at or near full employment and inflation is close to  the FOMC’s target of 2  \npercent , yet short -term interest rates remain near historic lows. Just as raising rates too \nquickly can slow the economy and push inflation to undesirably low levels, keeping rates \ntoo low can also create risks. Interest -sensitive sectors can take on too much debt in \nresponse to low rates and grow quickly, then unwind in ways that are disruptive. We \nwitnessed this during both the housing crisis and the current adjustments in the energy \nsector.  Because monetary policy has a  powerful effect on financial conditions, it can give \nrise to imbalances  or capital misallocation  that negatively affect s longer -run growth . \nAccordingly , I favor taking additional steps in the normalization process.  \nMoving rates to a more -normal level and at a gradual pace  is necessary to \nminimize distortions in the economy that can build over many years when rates are held \nso low. With gradual adjustments, the F ederal Reserve  is more likely in my view  to \nachieve its long -run goals and by doing so, foster conditions for steady growth that \nbenefit both New Mexico and the nation."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 7, 2016  \nEconomic Forum  \nYork, Neb.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n 1 “It seems rather striking that one of the ideas now firmly imbedded in our articles \nof material faith, the concept of governmental responsibility for m oderating economic \ngyrations, is almost entirely a product of our own Twentieth Century.  \n “This concept, which is steadily being brought into sharper focus, has evolved \nfrom general reaction to a succession of material crises heavy in human hardship.  It \ngrew from mass desperation and demand for protection from economic disasters beyond \nindividual control.  \n “The Federal Reserve System, which I have the honor to represent, was our \nearliest institutional response to such a demand.  It emerged out of the urgen t need to \nprevent recurrences of such disasters as the money panic of 1907, and out of the thought \nthat the Government had a definite responsibility to prevent financial crises and should \nutilize all its powers to do so.  \n “Accordingly , … Congress entrusted  to the Federal Reserve System responsibility \nfor managing the money supply.  This was a historic and revolutionary step.  In framing \nthe Federal Reserve Act great care was taken to safeguard this money management from \nimproper interference by either priva te or political interests.  That is why we talk about \nthe overriding importance of maintaining our independence.  Hence we have our system \nof regional banks headed up by a coordinating Board in Washington intended to have \nonly that degree of centralized au thority required to discharge effectively a national \npolicy.  This constitutes, as those of you in this audience recognize, a blending of public \ninterest and private enterprise uniquely American in character.  Too few of us adequately \nrecognize or adequate ly salute the genius of the framers of our central banking system in \nproviding this organizational bulwark of private banking and business.  \n\n 2  “Since the Federal Reserve System came into being, the problems of inelasticity \nof currency and immobility of bank reserves -- which so often showed up as shortages of \ncurrency or credit in times of critical need -- have been eliminated, and money panics \nhave largely disappeared.  \n “In this specialized respect there can be no doubt that the System has made \nnotable progr ess, but in the more fundamental role of stabilizing the economy the record \nis not so clear.  All of us in the System are bending our best efforts to capitalize on the \nexperience of the past, and our current knowledge of money, so as to make as large a \ncontribution as possible in this direction.  But a note should be made here that, while \nmoney policy can do a great deal, it is by no means all powerful.  In other words, we \nshould not place too heavy a burden on monetary policy.  It must be accompanied by \nappropriate fiscal and budgetary measures if we are to achieve our aim of stable \nprogress.  If we ask too much of monetary policy we will not only fail but we will also \ndiscredit this useful, and indeed indispensable, tool for shaping our economic \ndevelopmen t.”1 \n I’ll pause here to give credit to former Federal Reserve Chairman William \nMcChesney Martin , who delivered these remarks on October 19, 1955.   His remarks \nmore than six decades ago remain relevant today and in particular echo my own concern \nthat the public has come to expect that monetary policy can solve for every problem that \nails the U .S. economy.  \nI am here in York, Nebraska , with members of our Omaha Branch office board of \ndirectors , who serve as important windows on the current economic landscape.  Those \n                                                        \n1 Addresss of William McChesney Martin , before the New York Group of the Investment Bankers \nAssociation of America, Waldorf A storia Hotel, New York City, Oct. 19, 1955  \n\n 3 insights are enormously valuable to me as I make my own assessments of the economy \nand form my policy views as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) .  \nThis evening, I’ ll offer you my thoughts on the state of the economy and current \nstance of monetary policy.  As you may know, I did not agree with the Committee’s \ndecision to hold rates steady at the most recent policy meeting last month.  I’ll explain \nmy views about poli cy, noting these are my own views and are not necessarily \nrepresentative of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe Economic Outlook  \nHere in Nebraska, a state with a significant agricultural profile, the economy has \nsoftened , as Nathan noted earlier in his remarks.  Across much of our region, the \ndowndraft in commodity prices, combined with a strong dollar, has had a chilling effect \non the regional economy.   \nFarm income is expected to weaken modestly in 2016, which would mark  a third \nconsecutive year in the current downturn. As lower income reduces cash flows, demand \nfor credit among farmers has continued to rise. At this stage, the delinquency rate on \nagricultural production loans remains well below levels from five years ago , and \nfarmland values, which are a significant contributor to the health of farm balance sheets, \nhave remained relatively stable. Should these values erode further, we might expect to \nsee further stresses on the agricultural sector.  \nLikewise, the dramatic  fall in oil and gas prices over the past 18 months has \nnegatively affected the region. The number of active oil and gas rigs in the U nited States  \nhas fallen by three -quarters, from almost 2,000 rigs at the peak to less than 500 today. \n\n 4 Weakness in energy -related investment has spread to upstream suppliers in \nmanufacturing sectors, resulting in broader signs of slowing capital investment  across the \nnation .  \nCredit conditions have tightened for energy -related companies , and s trains on the \nearnings are leading  to substantial job losses, particularly within our region, which \nincludes Oklahoma and Wyoming. The challenges facing those affected are substantial , \nalthough we do see that some of these workers are finding employment more easily than \nthey did during the  last oil price shock.2  \nBeyond these sectors, the U.S. economy as a whole has continued to expand , and \nit has been quite a long economic expansion by historical standards. Indeed, the FOMC \nviewed the economy a s sufficiently sound last December to warrant increasing short -term \ninterest rates.   \nSince the December meeting, economic data have largely confirmed an outlook \nfor further growth. We have received four strong labor reports as well as data showing \nthat inflation is moving higher.   \nUnfortu nately, however, the initiation of raising interest rates coincided with what \nappears to be a more vulnerable global economy, and a domestic economy that appears to \nbe slowing in the first quarter and is threatened by markets that are anxious, uncertain, \nand volatile. Faced with these dynamics, the Federal Reserve’s decisions to continue to \nnormalize its policy settings have become more difficult.   \nIn the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, the FOMC is guided by a focus on \nlonger -run objectives —those o bjectives outlined by Congress in the Federal Reserve Act \n                                                        \n2 Brown, Jason and Andres Kodaka , “The Reallocation of Energy -Sector Workers after Oil Price Boo ms \nand Busts ,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro  Bulletin, March 3, 2016.  \n\n 5 and expressed by the FOMC in its annual Longer Run Goals and Monetary Policy \nStrategy :  “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open \nMarket Committee shall maintain lon g run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates \ncommensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to \npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long -\nterm interest rates.”3 \nAlthough  financial markets were off to a volatile start this year, economic \nfundamentals remain relatively strong, particularly conditions in the labor market. More \njobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any other year since the late 1990s .  This  \ntrend has conti nued  with the economy add ing an average of more than 200,000  net new \njobs per month  in 2016 . The ongoing  strength in job gains is well above the trend rate \nneeded to absorb new entrants into the labor force. As a result, we have seen people  who \nhad been on the sidelines and not working over the past five years  start to re -enter the \nlabor force. And even as people have returned to the labor market, job growth has been \nstrong enough so that the unemployment rate continued to fall  over the last  year. At 5.0 \npercent , the unemployment rate is quite close to the longer -run estimate of normal.  \nIn addi tion to a healthy labor market,  consumer spending has been supported by \nstronger household  balance sheet s. There are , of course , exceptions, but overall , \nhousehold budgets generally look far less extended today than they did in the mid -2000s. \nThe debt service ratio, which measures the burden of debt payments relative to income, is \nalso lower than at any other time since the Federal Reserve started collecting data on this \nmeasure in 1980.  \n                                                        \n3 Section 2A  of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977.  \n\n 6 Household balance sheets also have benefited from housing prices . On a national \nbasis, prices are close to where they were prior to the crisis. The supply of homes remains \nquite limited , relative to the total number  of households, and is the lowest it’s been for \nmore than  40 years.4 This combination of limited inventory , robust job growth and low \ninterest rates  will likely support continued home price appreciation. Those positive \nconditions will remain tempered by other factors weighing on housing. Credit conditions \nremain tighter than before the crisis, and bankers tell me new mortgage application \nprocedures pose some challenges in moving borrowers through the finan cing process.  \nOverall, I view the health of household balance sheets and robust job growth as \nproviding a foundation for consumer spending to continue making steady contributions to \neconomic growth. This should allow G DP growth to continue near 2 percent,  which I \nview as  consistent with the economy’s  long-run potential.   \nWith an unemployment rate of 5.0 percent, the economy is near full employment. \nMeasures of inflation appear to reflect stable prices with upward movement in c ore PCE \ninflation year -over-year (from 1.3  percent  to 1.7  percent  over the past three  months) .  In \nthe interest of objectives to promote long -run sustainable growth with healthy \nemployment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these \ndevelopments by slowly removing accommodation.  \n \nThe Current Stance of Monetary Policy   \nToday, monetary policy can be viewed as  highly accommodative for three \nreasons. First, the current federal funds target range of between 0.25  percent to 0.5 \n                                                        \n4 Rappaport, Jordan, “ The Limited Supply of Homes,”  Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, The Macro  \nBulletin, March 23, 2016.  \n\n 7 percent  is quite far from the fed funds’ long -run level, which the FOMC views at around \n3.25% . Second, the FOMC has signaled that the fed funds rate will be raised only \ngradual ly. And third, the Fed continues to hold a $4.2 trillion balance sheet , which has \nthe effect of keeping longer -term interest rates low.  \nYears of experience, evidence and rese arch remind us that monetary policy is \nmost effective when used as a counter -cyclical tool . That means providing policy \naccommodation when deteriorating economic conditions threaten price stability and \nemployment. Conversely, it means unwind ing accommodati on as we see economic \nconditions improve . In other words, the Fed should cut rates when the economy stumbles \nor contracts, and raise rates as the economy recovers and grows .  \n \nThe Limits of Monetary Policy  \nWhile monetary policy can be an effective counter -cyclical tool, it is by no means \na counter -structural  tool. That is, monetary policy can work to smooth out some of the \nups and downs in economic activity, but can do little to push the trend rate of growth \nhigher. Any persistent attempts to do so will likely prove futile, as longer -run growth is \ndriven by real factors like population growth, productivity and the accumulation of \ncapital, both human capital from educational attainment and physical capital from \nbusiness investment .  \nThe FOMC  has ackno wledged that economic conditions will likely warrant a \ngradual pace of policy adjustments. I support that approach. A gradual path allows us to \ntake into account various headwinds and risks faced by the economy , and to proceed in a \n\n 8 manner that maintains po licy settings that are —and will continue to be for some time —\nvery accommodative.   \nWhile I view the gradual approach as appropriate, p ostponing the removal of \naccommodation  when the economy is near full employment and inflation is rising toward \nthe 2  percent  target could promote alternative risks that would decrease the likelihood of \nachieving our longer -run objectives. In the long run, a failure to keep interest rate policy \nin line with improving fundamentals can distort the allocation of capital tow ard less \nfruitful —or perhaps excessively risky —endeavors. Within the last two decades we have \nfaced episodes of accelerating equity prices, housing prices and, most recently, \ncommodity prices. Currently, commercial real estate markets, where prices have \ncontinued to drift higher , bear watching . When these types of imbalances tip, the entire \neconomy can face the consequences of their fallout, with some sectors and populations \nmore impacted than others.  My concern for some time has been that extending monetar y \npolicy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic and \npolitical distortions.  \nIn the current environment, w aiting to make additional adjustments to monetary \npolicy may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressur es. Some argue that we \nhave the ability to make more rapid adjustments later if inflation moves higher than \ncurrently projected.  From a technical standpoint, it is true that the Fed has the ability to \nsteer short -term rates and could raise them quickly if needed. But such actions are likely \nto be costly, induc ing financial market volatility and slowing economic activity. \nHistorically, rapid increases in interest rates end poorly, resulting in economic recessions.  \n \n\n 9 Conclusion  \nStaying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted in my \nview. Removing accommodation i n small doses is consistent with the economy’s \nfundamentals, keeps policy accommodative  while global and domestic risks play out , and \ndoes not preclude pausing or respond ing if downside risks materialize."

Outlook and Monetary Policy  \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 2, 2016  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, M o. \n \n\n \n1 \n  \nThank you.  It’s a pleasure to be here at the Central Exchange. The Kansas City Fed has \nhad a long and productive relationship with the Central Exchange  and I always enjoy the \nopportunity to join you .  \nLast week, I participated in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  meeting where \nthe Committee decided to hold steady its target interest rate . I supported this decision and , in my \nremarks this afternoon , I will share my views on the economic outlook and monetary policy .  \nBefore we continue, I need to tell you that these comments represent my views and are \nnot necessarily reflective of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe U .S. Outlook  \nSince the end of the financial crisis, the U.S. economy has grow n annually by about  2 \npercent and labor markets have made large strides toward healing. As a longer -term comparison, \nwe are now in the fifth -longest expansion in recorded U .S. history. Inflation has also remained \nlow and stable. While  there are always uncertainties about how the economy will perform in the \nfuture, it’s worth reflecting on the past and acknowledging the progress that has been made. \nRight now, I view the economy as being in a good spot, but I will also discuss some risks I am \nkeeping in m ind.   \nTurning first to recent data , economic growth slowed a bit  toward the end of last year , \nthough overall growth in 2015 was not too different than the past few years. Some of the softness \nreflected fewer exports and a modest step -down in the level of business investment in new \nstructures and equipment. Other factors, like inventory adjustments , also lowered the growth \nestimate.  \n\n \n2 \n While a single quarter of slower growth is important to watch, I take reassurance that the \neconomy remains on track due to strong job gains. In fact, j ob gains actually picked up  toward \nthe end of last year.  Looking at longer trends, employment growth has been quite strong over the \npast few years. More jobs were added in both 2014 and 2015 than in any year since the late \n1990s .  \nAt the same time, demographic changes are affect ing the labor market  outlook. For \nexample, U .S. population growth is slowing, which indicates not as many jobs need to be created \nas in the past to absorb new entrants into the labor force . As a result, I expect to see employment \ngrowth slow from its recent  pace and would not interpret a modest slowdown as a sign of trouble \nin the economy.   \nOverall, I see job gains as underpinning stronger consumer demand for goods and \nservices.  Low gasoline prices and signs of faster wage growth should  also add to consumers ’ \nability to increase spending.  And although financial markets have been volatile, household \nwealth remains at  a high level , and house prices have been rising over the past four years.  \nCertainly, the gains in jobs, wages and wealth have not been equally shared across households \nduring the recovery, but overall , the general health  of households’ financial situation s is much \nimproved since  the financial crisis.  \nEven as households  and consumers are doing better, some sectors of the economy are \nfacing headwinds. I mentioned earlier l ow gasoline prices, which o f course reflect low oil prices. \nBecause the energy sector is such an important part of the Kansas City Fed’s region al economy, \nwe monitor these developments closely. We know l ower oil prices benefit consumers, but also \nweigh on oil producers. We have certainly seen energy -intensive states affected. For example, \n\n \n3 \n we are seeing more  people every week filing claims for unemployment insurance in Oklahoma \nthan was the case a few years ago.  \nJust as d evelopments in the energy sector bear watching, so do challenges facing the \nmanufacturing sector. The rise in the foreign exchange value of the U .S. dollar, for example, has \nresulted in lower orders from abroad for many of our exporters. In addition, foreign growth in \nsome parts of the world has been uneven and slowing, which has  affected foreign demand for \nsome U .S. goods. Despite these headwinds , the U.S. economy has proven itself to be resilient to \na wide range of shocks in recent years, including sluggish growth abroad . \nFinally, i nflation has remained muted as a result of l ower oil prices and the strong U.S. \ndollar . Recent movements in each of thes e have been quite large by historical standards. Yet , \ndespite these headwinds, core measures of inflation have recently risen on a year -over-year basis.  \nAnd although inflation rates over the past few years have hovered below  the Fed’s goal of 2  \npercent , they have been positive and broadly consistent with price stability.  \n \nRisks to the Outlook  \nOutlooks are subject to change, and forecasts are imperfect predictions of the future.  As \na result, those , like me , who rely on forecasts,  must think about what could go wrong  and how \nincoming data might affect the outlook for the economy .  Gauging whether a temporary \nslowdown in growth, financial market volatility or foreign developments  is a harbinger of \nweaker growth or a reflection of temporary factors , can be  difficult and often require s assessing \nbroader trends and risks.   \nRight now, I view the U .S. economy as in a generally  good position. However, a few \ndevelopments bear watching. I mentioned the energy sector. We are certainly paying attention to \n\n \n4 \n any spillovers that energy job losses may have on the broader economy. Elevated inventories in \nsome sectors also  pose a risk  to the extent that manufacturing production slow s further to  better \nalign current inventory levels with final sales and shipments o f goods.  Finally, g lobal growth is \ncommonly pointed to as a risk. While I wouldn’t discount recent developments abroad, I also \nnote that many forecasts point to a modestly stronger foreign outlook this year than in 2015.  Still, \nsome emerging markets carry substantial debt, so a crisis in one area can transmit to others. But \ndespite these concerns , the fundamentals of the U.S. economy currently appear strong enough to \nsustain positive growth going forward.  \n \nThe Path for Monetary Policy  \nTurning to monetary po licy, for seven years, the FOMC maintained near-zero interest \nrates and undertook a  series of  large -scale asset purchase program s — a policy stance re sponding \nto a historic financial and economic emergency  in 2008 .  Accordingly, the FOMC’s decision to \nalter that policy stance in December garnered a great deal of attention when the benchmark \ninterest rate was increased by 25 basis point s.  I supported this decision , although I viewed it as a \nlate start to what is likely to be  a gradual  path toward  normalizing interest rates .   \nAfter such a prolonged period of low rates, the FOMC is understandably cautious.  \nMoving rates gradually may avoid unnecessarily jolting the economy or causing excessive \nfinancial market volatility. Even looking at developments so far this year, financial markets have \nbeen quite volatile. While taking a signal from such volatility is warranted, monetary policy \ncannot respond  to every blip in financial markets . Instead, a focus on economic fundamentals, \nsuch as labor markets and inflation, can help guard against monetary policy over - or under -\nreacting to swings in financial conditions . To a great extent , the recent  bout of  volatility is not all \n\n \n5 \n that unexpected, nor necessarily worrisome, given that the Fed’s low interest rate and bond -\nbuying policies focused on boosting asset prices as a means of stimulating the real economy.  As \nasset prices adjust to the shift in monetary policy , it is to be expected that the pricing of risk will \nrealign to this different rate environment . \nOverall, it is important to remember  that e ven after th is first rate hike, monetary policy \nremains  highly accommodative .  Real interest rates continue to be negative and the Federal \nReserve ’s large portfolio of Treasury and mortgage -backed securities  keep s downward pressure \non longer -term rates .  \nIn communicating its intentions for further rate increases, t he Committee has noted that it \nexpects economic conditions will warrant only  gradual increases in the fed funds rate , although \nadjustments ultimately depend on the incoming data .  My own view is that a pickup in economic \ngrowth, steady job gains and modestly higher core rates of inflation will warrant further \nincreases .   \nThe exact timing of each move, however, is subject to the economic environment.   \nBecause  monetary  policy affects the economy with lags , decisions must necessarily rely on \nforeca sts and their associated risks — not waiting until desired objectives are realized.   \nIf we wait for the data to provide complete confirmation before making a policy decision, \nwe may well have waited too long.  Likewise, policy may be faced with altering its trajectory if \nthe economy’s p rogress points to a different outlook.  But in the absence of any substantial shift \nin the outlook, my view is that the Committee should continue the gradual adjustment of moving \nrates higher to keep them aligned with economic activity and inflation. These actions are often \ndifficult, but also necessary to keep growth in line with the economy’s long -run potential and to \nfoster price stability.   \n\n \n6 \n  \nInstitutional Challenges  \nAs the Federal Reserve contemplates the appropriate path of normalizing its monetary \npolicy, it naturally does so with considerable public attention.  One source of this attention \ncomes from Congress itself.  Calls for legislative reforms of the Federal Re serve have persisted \nover the past five years, ranging from its structure and governance to its monetary policy \napproach and decision making.  Additionally, Congress has shown its willingness to tap the \nFederal Reserve to fund fiscal activities ranging fro m new government agencies to highway \nconstruction.   \nI understand that Fed actions during the crisis have raised a number of questions about \nthe institution and its scope. When Congress established the Federal Reserve more than a century \nago, it designed t he institution to be apolitical but with accountability to Congress. This construct \nwas designed to protect the stewards of the nation’s money supply from the vulnerabilities \nassociated with short -term political agendas.  It includes important checks and b alances that are \noften misunderstood, but nonetheless critical to the functioning of the institution.   \nDuring my 33 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the primary focus of \nthousands of dedicated Federal Reserve employees has been the health  of the economy, \nsupported by an efficient and accessible banking and payments system. To the extent that there is \nany doubt in the minds of Congress or the public about this, it is incumbent on the Federal \nReserve to work with Congress in a direct and tra nsparent way until we satisfy any remaining \nquestions about the execution of our mission.  Such dialogue would provide the highest \nprobability for outcomes that best serve the public interest.  \n In that spirit, I look forward to 2016 and the promise it hol ds."

It is my pleasure to be here to offer my observations on what may \nbe one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of our national  payment \nsystem —the public -private engagement that is taking shape to improve the system’s \nspeed, efficiency  and security . This engagement is designed to meet the growing \ndemand s of American consumers and business es that continue to shift toward  e-\ncommerce and Internet -enabled technologies  in their da ily transactions .  \nTo some, it may seem like an unusual approach that we’ve taken , but it is not a \nnew one at its core . Based on a history of mutual cooperation on payments  issues  \nbetween the Federal Reserve and the private sector , we have seen public -private \nengagement s yield important gains for the country . Such collaboration in the past \nproduced outcomes that contributed to a more resilient payments system and provided \nsignificant benefits  to the public, such as  the development of routing numb ers, the growth \nof the automated clearing house network, and the crafting of Check 21 legislation.1 \nI’m encouraged by the recent progress that we’ve made  with the current effort , \nand it is my own conviction that the prospects for achieving the goals we’ve set out are \nbest realized by working together.  The organizers of this conference used the right word \nin naming it.  It is imperative  that we modernize the  payment s system, and also that the \nFederal Reserve and the industry join together  in this effort.  \nIn my remarks this morning, I will preface my observations about the status of our \nwork by reflecting on the nature of the challenge s we face  and the strategies that have \nbeen framed to address them . These strategies, as you know, are the product of the \nFederal Reserve ’s deliberate and broad consultation with a multitude of stakeholders \n                                                 \n1 See: Medley, Bill. Highways of Commerce: Central  Banking and the U.S. Payments System . Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City. 2014.  \n\n \n2 \n involved in  payment s system modernization . That input importantly shaped the paper \nissued in January of this year by the Federal Reserve Board and the Re serve Banks , titled \nStrategies for  Improving the U.S. Payment System .  \n \nThe challenge  \n  Since e -commerce took hold  in the United States more than  20 years ago , it has \ngrown rapidly in volume, speed and capability and has transformed retail and business -\nto-business commer ce. Among the most profound and pervasive changes has been t he \nrising  expectation of consumers and business es for continuous improvement s in speed \nand efficiency.  People who have come to expect regular upgrades in computers and \ncommunications  technology  have also come to expect more functionality from their \ncomputers , tablets  and smart phones to help them buy things.  And so, same -day delivery \nof almost anything , for example, has become a way of life  that most of us could not have \nimagined  even a few years ago.  \n It was also some  20 years ago  that online banking became common ly available , \nand here , too, there has been significant growth in speed, volume and the range of \nservices  that banks provide . Simply put, Americans who demand fast and dependable \ndelivery of wh at they buy and sell want their payments to keep up.  An analysis \ncommissioned by the Fed eral Reserve  found that each year there are 29 billion payments \nfor which real -time or near -real-time delivery would be desirable to end users.  One-third \nof consumers a nd fully three -fourths  of businesses want real -time payments , and they are \nnow willing to pay  for them . \n\n \n3 \n   The growth of e -commerce and advances in communication  have spurred \ninnovation  and new business opportunities in the United States.  Some o f the most  \nvaluable, innovative and admired  businesses in the world are technology companies  that \nwere founded here and remain here.  But the sizable and widespread economic gains from \nthese advances require a payment system that meets the demands of consumers and \nbusinesses.  We have seen a  number of other countries mov e forward with faster and \nmore -efficient payment systems to better serve their citizens and compete with the United \nStates for new and expanding business . With this advanced capability, however, has \ncome a significant and evolving threat to the s ecurity of banking and commerce . The \nneed to stay ahead of this threat alone is a compelling reason to modernize the payment \nsystem.  \n \nDesired outcomes  \nThese challenge s prompted the Federal Reserve to undertake careful study several \nyears ago and to seek extensive public input  about the need to improve the U.S. payment \nsystem.  By 2013, the Federal Reserve identified certain desired outcomes , based on its \nown analysis and private sector input .  \nLet me describe tho se desired outcomes as a way to remind  you of where we are \nheaded . First and foremost is the development of a  safe and  faster electronic solution for \nmaking a variety of business and personal payments  that is both ubiquitous and available \non demand.  Such a  system would be  supported by a flexible and cost -effective means for \npayment clearing and settlement that would be  rapid and final.   \n\n \n4 \n Our second  desired outcome is a payment  system that remains safe and resilient . \nAny enhancements to  speed and efficiency m ust maintain both the privacy and integrity \nof our system and allow for continuous improvements to security as threats emerge and \nevolve.  Specifically, w e anticipate  potential improvements to the Federal Reserve’s \npublicly  available payment fraud data as well as  additional payment security research.  \nWe also look forward to sharing our results with payment stakeholders because we \nbelieve they will help inform future industry actions and policy decisions.  \nEfficiency is a third desired outcome . A reliable alternative to th e 18 billion paper \nchecks  written each year  could reduce th e average end -to-end cost of payment \ntransactions  and allow innovative payment services to  deliver better  value to consumers \nand businesses alike.  \n Our fourth desired outcome focuses on access  and efficiency  in cross -border \npayments.  A new payment system should offer better choices for U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses to send and receive convenient, cost -effective and timely cross -border \npayments.  We hea rd widespread support for  this goal among stakeholders.  Although \nthere is a range  of views about the priority for such payments , few dispute that the cost \nand convenience of cross -border payments have not kept pace with the impact o f \nglobalization.   \nOur fi fth desired outcome is simple : We need to work together . The Federal \nReserve cannot implement meaningful payments improvement on its own , and the \ncompetitive forces driving industry inn ovation mean the private sector’s ability to meet \nthe public’s needs would benefit from the kind of coordination and collaboration that the \nFederal Reserve  is uniquely positioned to provide.  Working together, w e believe the \n\n \n5 \n private sector can and should be able to provide the innovat ion necessary to address the \nneeds of the market .  \n \nMaking progress toward these g oals  \nFollowing our review of public comments and lengthy consult ation with \nstakeholders, the Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks issued in January of this \nyear a paper that outlined strategies  for improving the payment system .  \nThese strategies represent  the first steps in a roadmap for payments \nmodernization , and they define the appro ach for how the Fed eral Reserve  will work with \nthe private sector.  We expect and encourage private industry to advanc e these goals by \noffering its own ideas and plans . But we also expect to see cooperation and, at some \npoint, visible evidence of both commitment and progress from all stakeholders.  \n Since the strategies paper was published  early this year , active engagement has \ntaken shape  with the creation of two task forces . One is focused on faster payments and \nthe other on the security  of payments .  \nOne way of describing the breadth of this effort is that many in this audience  \nalready are  members themselves or part of organizations represented on one or both task \nforces . At last count, the faster payments task force has more than 320 members and the \nsecure payments task force more than 170.  There are represen tatives of technology \nproviders;  small, medium a nd large financial institutions; payments networks; t rade \nassociations; business end users and consumers;  and a small number of government \nofficials.  Each task force  has chosen a steering committee , and w ork streams are \nunderway .  \n\n \n6 \n The Faster Payments Task Force, with its large and diverse membership, began \nwork  on criteria that will describe the standards for effectiveness in delivering faster \npayments . Members of the Secure Payments Task Force and a work group of legal  \nsubject matter experts are providing specialized input to that work . When finalized, these  \ncriteria will serve as both a description of stakeholder needs that the market can use to \nguide  faster payments innovation and a tool for the task f orce itself to assess alternative \napproaches for faster payments  solutions . \n The task force also has developed  and approved  a decision -making framework . \nThis framework ensures  that its decisions and work  products have broad support of the \ntask force membership, including support within and across the different stakeholder \ngroups represented.  Just yesterday, the Faster Payments Task force posted to the \nFedPaymentsImprovement .org website the latest draft of the criteria along with a survey \nto gather even broader public input . This effort to finalize the faster payments  \neffectiveness criteria  in the coming months  remains on track .   \nTo prepare for the evaluation of different approaches to payment modernization, \nthe Faster Payments Task Force is currently working to carefully define a process for \nencouraging the best ideas to come forward and assessing them against the effectiveness \ncriteria . In addition to identifying effective solutions for faster payments, the task force \nwill note the foundational aspects of a faster payment system that no single  solution \nprovider can deliver independently, and when implemented , will enable those providers \nto interoperate and deliver to end users a consistent, accessible and universal faster \npayments experience.  Finally, the task f orce will highlight strategic issues and gaps that it \n\n \n7 \n believes must be addressed to pave the way for successful implementation and \nwidespread ado ption of these solutions.   \nTurning to t he Secure Payments Task F orce, its work has begun with a focus on \nthe security needed for faster payments solutions , including a high priority on identity \nmanagement and authentication and finding more effective ways to protect sensitive \ninformation that travels through the payment system.  Importantly, however, the work of \nthe Secure Payments Task Force extends beyond the security needed for new faster \npayments.  It is also focused on curren t payment networks and channels . As threats \nchange , they are considering better ways to share fraud and cyber -threat information and \nto analyze such data.  Finally, t he Secure Payments Task Force will advise the Fed eral \nReserve  on priorities related to paym ents security standards , research  and education in \norder to promote enhanced safety of payments systems old and new.  \nAs the task forces continue their work, the Federal Reserve  will do its part to \nensure  that the process is progressing smoothly toward the desired outcomes I noted \nearlier . Task force m embership will continue to be representative of diverse stakeholder \nperspectives and interests, and we will recruit when appropriate to fulfill that goal . We \nwant active task force participation that contributes to and takes ownership of work \nproducts and decisions.  We will facilitate interaction and ensure processes and tools are \nin place to support the development of high -quality work produc ts that achieve task force \nobjectives.  In all of this, we wa nt to promote a process that carefully considers the \ninterests of all stakeholders, objectively evaluates different proposals, and arrives at an \napproach that will have broad support.  The hallmark of this process will be transparency \nand good communication , which are essential to reaching consensus.    \n\n \n8 \n Let me conclude by emphasizing  that the progress achieved so far has been \nimpressive and encouraging.  I remain confident t hat this collaborative approach to \npayment  system reform maximizes  our chances for succ ess. I am also realistic.  The task \nforces have made s ubstantive progress, but there is some distance to go before realizing \nour goals.  I fully expect that we will face challenges along the way.  But I am convinced \nthe end is worth the journey , and the Federal Reserve is  committed to working with \nindustry stakeholders to get there for the public’s sake ."

George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 9, 2015  \nOklahoma  Economic  Forum  \nStillwater,  Oklahoma  \nThe views  expressed  by the author  are her own and do not necessarily  reflect  those  of the Federal  Reserve  System,  \nits governors,  officers  or representatives.   \n\n1 \n Seven  years  ago, our economy  was dealt  a tremendous  blow.  The financial  crisis  and \ndeep  recession  required  massive  bailouts  and aggress ive, unconventional  monetary  policy  \nactions  to restore  financial  stability  and economic  growth.  And yet, seven  years  later,  uncertainty  \nlingers  about  the durability  and strength  of financial  reforms  and of the economy  itself.  Clearly , \nthe financial  crisis  of 2008  cast a long shadow.  \nIn my remarks  today,  I will offer  my own observations  about  the current  state of the \neconomy  and why I believe  the Federal  Reserve  should  start the process  of interest  rate \nnormalization  sooner  rather  than later.  I’ll close  with some  perspectives  on the state of key \nregulatory  reforms  affecting  the banking  industry  and, in particular , the nation’s community  \nbanks.   \nThese  are my own views  and not those  of the Federal  Open  Market  Committee  or the \nFederal  Reserve  System.  \n \nThe economic  outlook  \nIn 2013,  during  my first voting  rotation  on the Federal  Open  Market  Committee,  I did not \nsupport  additional  stimulus  in the form  of a third  round  of asset  purchases.  By then,  the \nimmediate  crisis  had passed,  the economy  was slowly  expandin g for its third  consecutive  year,  \nand monetary  policy  settings  remained  extraordinarily  accommodative.  At the end of my voting  \ncycle,  I fully  anticipated  that a return  to more -normal  interest  rates  would  require  a lengthy  and \ngradual  adjustment  process.  But, I did not imagine  that in 2015  we might  still have  the same  \npolicy  stance.  \nDuring  the past five years,  the U.S. economy  has grown  at a moderate  pace each year,  \nlabor  markets  have  healed—albeit  with scars  from  the recession—and inflation  has remained  \n\n2 \n low. This year,  the economy  had a slower -than-expected  start.  The soft GDP  report  for the first \nquarter  reflected  some  temporar y factors  that held down  growth  but are unlikely  to persist  going  \nforward.  Looking  ahead,  I expect  the economy  to resume  its expa nsion  at an above -trend  growth  \nrate through  the end of the year and labor  market  conditions  to continue  improving.   \nConsumer  spending,  the largest  part of our economy,  will likely  grow  at a healthy  rate in \nthe quarters  ahead  due to an improving  labor  marke t, rising  wealth  and lower  gasoline  prices  \nrelative  to where  they were  last year.  Moreover,  as the economy  continues  to heal and domestic  \ndemand  continues  to strengthen,  businesses  should  have  more  incentives  to increase  capital  \nexpenditures.  I also expect  housing  construction  to provide  a tailwind  to growth  as more  adults  \npack  up and move  out of their parents’ home  or away  from  living  with roommates  to start their \nown households.  Construction  of multi family  units,  in particular,  has been  strong  due to rising  \ndemand  from  younger  workers  and the decisions  of some  baby  boomers  to downsize .  \nIn terms  of the labor  market,  the economy  added  3 million  jobs over the past year. For \nperspective,  consider  that the economy  did not even  add this many  new jobs over a one-year \nperiod  at any point  during  the housing  bubble  years.  You would  need  to go back  to the late 1990s  \ntech-bubble  era to find a period  when  jobs were  being  added  at a similar  pace.  In addition  to the \nnumber  of jobs,  we are seeing  better  jobs.  For example,  work ers today  are flowing  into more -\nstable  employment  relationships , and workers  with a high-school  diploma  or some  college  are \nfinding  employment  in higher -skilled  occupations,  something  that was not occurring  in the years  \nfollowing  the crisis.1 \nTaken  together,  the economic  data generally  point  to an economy  that is moving  in the \nright  direction  and has consistently  sustained  growth  over the past five years.  This is not to say \n                                                 \n1 See “Opportunity  Knocks:  Improved  Matching  of Jobs and Workers” by Didem  Tuzemen  and Jonathan  Willis.  The \nMacro  Bulletin , Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City,  May 13, 2015.  \n\n3 \n the economy  is issue -free. There  are pockets  of the labor  market  that continue  to struggle.  \nResearch  shows  that workers  who enter  the labor  force  during  the lean years  of a recession  and \nrecovery  experience  long-lasting  scarring  effects  on their earning  potential.2 Millions  of workers  \nhad difficulty  finding  employment  and missed  some  experience  needed  to jump -start their \ncareers,  resulting  in fewer  skills,  underdeveloped  resumes  and lower  earnings.  In addition,  \nproductivity  growth,  which  ultimately  drives  living  standards  higher,  has been  notably  soft in \nrecent  years.  And, global  economic  concerns  can pose unpredictable  risks  to our economy.  \nUnfortunately,  although  we might  wish  it so, monetary  policy  is not the proper  tool to \naddress  all of these  issues.  The aggressive  monetary  actions  over the past few years  were  \nintended  to support  economic  activity,  help labor  markets  heal and move  inflation  toward  the \nFed’s target.  I view  the considerable  progress  in labor  markets  and the relatively  steady inflation  \nrate as encouraging.  However,  keeping  interest  rates  near zero to achieve  still further  progress  \ntoward  labor  market  improvement  and higher  inflation  is risky  in my view.   \nIn a protracted  period  of exceptionally  low rates,  investors  seeking  out higher  returns  are \nwilling  to take on more  risk or seek out more  creative  financing  approaches.  When  the economy  \nis expanding  and rates  remain  low, adverse  events  may appear  less likely  or far into the future,  \npotentially  resulting  in the mispricing  of risk and financial  assets.  Waiting  too long to adjust  \nrates,  as we’ve seen in the past, can leave  policymakers  with few and possibly  poor options .  \n \nSeparating  the signal  from  the noise  \nThe FOMC  has been  talking  about  its exit strategy  since  2011.  And since  March  of this \nyear,  the Committee  has been  emphasizing  that a decision  to raise  interest  rates  would  be data \n                                                 \n2 See “Long -Term  Nonemployment  and Job Displacement ” by Jae Song  and Till von Wachter,  presented  at the \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City’s  2014  Jackson  Hole  Economic  Policy  Symposium.  \n\n4 \n dependent.  In other  words,  economic  data that confirms  further  gains  in the economy’s \nperformance  will drive  the timing  of the Committee ’s action s.  \nSo, why hasn’t the FOMC  yet raised  rates?  There  are of course  different  views  on the \neconom ic data we receive  and analyze  that lead to legitimate,  differing  views  about  what  is best \nfor the economy.  The Federal  Reserve  is charged  with objectives  that take into account  \nemployment  and inflation  in order  to foster  stable  long-term growth  in the economy.  The FOMC  \nis committed  to pursuing  those  objectives , but policymakers  may differ  on the appropriate  path \nto achiev e these long-run goals.  \nOf course,  the economic  data we rely on can, and often  does in the short  run, send \nconflicting  signals,  and it is quite  challenging  to measure  economic  activity  in an $18 trillion,  \ndynamic  economy.  As a result, policymakers  are faced  with an unclear  path for moving  interest  \nrates.  Those  choices  are all the more  difficult  as we must  rely on backward -looking  data to frame  \na forecast  that takes  into account  the long lags of interest  rate changes.   \nUnder  such circumstances , the Federal Reserve  must  be especially  careful  to avoid  \nreacting  to the last data point  to determine  policy.  Instead,  it should  focus  on longer -run trends  as \nit seeks  to understand  the economy’ s future  course  and to map the best policy  to assure  it \nremains  on course.  The real challenge  when  the data disappoints  is discerning  whether  it is due \nto temporary  factors  or an early  signal  that underlying  momentum  in the economy  is changing.   \nTake  the first quarter  of this year as an example.  The current  estimate  is that the economy  \ncontracted  in the first quarter  after three  quarters  of relatively  strong  growth.  While  this headline  \nnumber  raises  caution  for policymakers,  other  factors,  as I mentioned  earlier,  suggest  the slowing  \nis likely  to be temporary.  Severe  winter  weather  and labor  negotiations  concerning  dock  workers  \nlikely  took a short -lived  toll on growth.  At the same  time,  however,  the economy  added  nearly  \n\n5 \n 600,000  new jobs in the first three  months  of this year.  So even  though  the economy  appeared  to \nslow  a bit in the first quarter,  businesses  kept hiring , and the data for the second  quarter  suggest  \nthe economy  is again  expanding.  Thus,  in the face of consistent  positive  trends,  delaying  actions  \nfor more  positive  data can be unwise.   \nConside r as another  example  measures  of inflation , which  have  been  running  below  the \nFed’s  stated  inflation  goal. Since  2012,  the Federal  Reserve  has defined  2 percent  inflation  as \n“most  consistent  over the longer  run with the Federal  Reserve’s statutory  mandate”  of price  \nstability.  Does  inflation  below  2 percent  justif y waiting  longer  to raise  rates?  The answer  \nrequires  a deeper  look at the data.  Much  of the decline  in inflation  comes  from  a dramatic  fall in \nenergy  prices  throughout  the second  half of 2014  and low import  prices  from  a strong  dollar.  The \nswings  in energy  and food prices  certainly  matter  for households  and are an important  \ncomponent  of the inflation  measure,  but sometimes  it’s also sensible  to look at price  changes  that \nexclude  these  volatile  goods.  Along  these  lines,  the core measure  of inflation  is running  at 1.2 \npercent  over the past year and has moved  up to a 1.7 percent  pace over the past three  months . \nThis data suggest  to me that we understand  why inflation  has been  low, and as some  temporary  \nfactors  fade,  it will likely  move  back  toward  the Fed’s  goal.  \nPart of our job is to look through  the noise  and act in the economy’s long-run best \ninterest.  Separating  the signal  from  the noise  is always  difficult  and is usually  clear  only with \nhindsight.  Because  monetary  policy  decisions  are made  in real time,  waiting  for more  data before  \ntaking  an action  can be a trap. More  data is always  on its way,  and waiting  for clarity  too often  \ncause s decisions  to be persistently  postponed.  \n \n \n\n6 \n Timing  is everything  \nThe continued  improvement  in the labor  market , combined  with low and stable  inflation , \nconvince  me that modestly  higher  short -term interest  rates  are appropriate.  Current  guideposts,  or \n“policy  rules,”  often  used to inform  monetary  policy  decisions  also have been  signaling  that \ninterest  rates  should  be higher.  \nI recognize  that a rate increase,  however,  would  be the first one in nearly  a decade.  So I \nam not suggesting  rates  should  be normalized  quickly  or that policy  should  be tight.  Although  \nthe economy  has improved,  economic  fundamentals  could  well mean  an accommodative  stance  \nof policy  is appropriate  for some  time.  I would  like to avoid  the cost of waiting  for more  \nevidence  and further  postponing  liftoff,  drawing  on a valuable  lesson  from  monetary  policy  \ndecisions  in 2003.   \nAt that time,  the federal  funds  rate was held at a very low level—1 percent—because  \npolicymakers  were  concerned  about  low inflation  and had postponed  initiating  the tightening  \ncycle  in response.  Inflation  excluding  food and energy  in late 2003  was running  at about  1.3 \npercent,  not dissimilar  from  today.  The unemployment  rate was slightly  below  6 percent , again,  \nnot dissimilar  from  today.   \nBy the middle  of 2004,  core inflation  increased  to 2 percent  as the unemployment  rate \ncontinued  to decline.  A gradual  tightening  cycle  began  in June of 2004.  Core  inflation  then \nmoved  persistently  above  2 percent,  and the labor  market  began  to overheat  amid  one of the most  \nhistoric  credit  bubbles  in U.S. history.    \nOf course,  many  would  argue  that we do not face a similar  buildup  of leverage  today  and \nthat the recov ery remains  fragile.  Perhaps  so, and perhaps  this time it's different.  However,  \n\n7 \n economic  trends  and experience  suggest  otherwise.  And we would  be wise to act modestly  but \nact now.   \n  \nProgress  on regulatory  reforms  \n In addition  to the lessons  for monetary  policy,  the recent  crisis  taught  us of the expanding  \nchallenges  following  from  an increasingly  concentrated  and fragile  financial  system.  While  the \nlargest  financial  institutions  are meant  to be engines  of growth,  they also pose outsized  risk to the \neconomy.  With  that in mind,  I take note that this month  marks  the fifth anniver sary of the \nsigning  of the Dodd -Frank  Act, the law that aimed  to remedy  problems  associated  with the 2008  \nfinancial  crisis and, in particular , sought  to end the status  of “too big to fail.” While  regulators  \nhave  worked  diligently  over the past five years  to implement  new rules,  debate  about  the law’s  \nvarious  provisions  continue s.  \nImplementing  rules  focused  on limiting  certain  risky  activities  has proved  difficult.  For \nexample,  the law prohibits  banks  from  conducting  proprietary  trading  and from  investing  in \nhedge  and private  equity  funds.  Regulators  have  struggled  with complexity  in writing  this rule, \nand banks  have  lobbied heavily  against  it. The final rule was not approved  until late 2013  and did \nnot go into effect  until April  of last year. The deadline  for fully  complying  with the rule could  \nextend  into 2017.    \nAnother  provision  aimed  at limiting  risky  activities  has already  been  repealed.  The so- \ncalled  push -out rule was designed  to move  trading  of credit  default,  commodity  and equity  swaps  \nout of federally -insured  depositories  to non-insured  operating  affiliates.  Congress  reversed  this \npart of the law last December , allowing  the nation’s largest  banks  to continue  their swaps  trading  \nwith the benefit  of public  safety  nets.   \n\n8 \n Also  core to the objectives  of the Dodd -Frank  reforms  was preventing  future  government  \nrescues  of big banks.  Last week,  another  round  of resolutio n plans,  referred  to as living  wills,  \nwas submitted  to the regulators.  It remains  open,  if not doubtful,  whether  a credible  resolution  \nprocess  can be codified  so as to eliminate—or even  minimize —the pressure  to rescue  a large  \ninsolvent  bank  with taxpayer  money.   \nOf course  many  point  to the progress  made  in strengthening  capital  levels  of the largest  \nbanks.  Today,  the 10 largest  banks  hold $8 of tangible  equity  for every  $100 of assets , far more  \nthan the $3 held in 2008 . However,  if the full value  of derivatives  is include d in assets,  as \nrequired  under  international  standards,  the ratio of capital -to-assets  is only 5 ½ percent. \nCompared  to more  than 10 percent  held by the nation’s community  banks , further  progress  is \nneeded.    \nFinally,  a large  segment  of the banking  industry  composed  of thousands  of community  \nbanks  faces a regulatory  overlay  intended  for those  engaged  in global  markets  and riskier  \nactivities.  Multiple  bills to provide  relief  from  certain  provisions  of the Dodd -Frank  Act have  \nbeen  proposed.  Most  practical  and promising  is a proposal  by FDIC  Vice  Chairman  Tom  Hoenig  \nthat focuses  on calibrating  regulation  according  to a bank’s activities  and complexity  rather  than \nsize. I hope  it is receiving  serious  consideration  in the interest  of a stronger  and more -stable  \nfinancial  system.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe U.S. economy  and its financial  system  have  made  notable  progress  over the past five \nyears.  Regulatory  reforms  and monetary  policy  have  been  necessary  ingredients  in achieving  this \nprogress.  But it is time to recalibrate  these  measures.   \n\n9 \n Our regulatory  efforts  must  remain  centered  on ending  too big to fail without  \nundermining  the health  and diversity  of the financial  system.  Likewise,  monetary  policy  must  \nstep back  and allow  market  forces  to resume  their critical  role of pricing  risk and allocating  \ncapital  to its best use. Although  an accommodative  stance  of policy  may be needed  for some  \ntime during  this transition,  monetary  policy  cannot  solve  every  economic  challenge  we face.  \nStarting  now to move  rates up slowly  and deliberately  will allow  the economy  to adjust  to a \nmore -normal  and, in my view,  appropriate  stance  of monetary  policy  that will lead to long-term \ngrowth."

The conference has highl ighted \nencouraging areas of progress , including  technology, information sharing and  collaborative \nefforts  among financ ial institutions , networks, consumers and regulators. It also has served as a \nreminder that sizeable challenges remain . \nThe Federal Reserve has a keen interest in promoting the safety and the security of the \nnation’ s payments system , given its impact on the broader economy and public trust . As both an \noperator and an overseer within the payments system, the Federal Reserve is prepared to \nleverage its central bank roles to bring about critical improvements for payments security . \nAlthou gh the Federal Reserve is relatively unique among c entral banks in terms of its \nretail payments operator role, public authorities around the world have become more active in \nraising concerns about  retail payments security. Some authorities play explicit ro les with public \nmandates, while others rely on leadership to induce volu ntary changes in the industry. In the \nUnited States , the central bank has chosen to serve as a leader for a collaborative approach , \ninvolving a wide range of payments participants  as the path toward improving the system.  \nThis is not a new role  for the Federal Reserve . Since its founding, the public has looked \nto the Federal Reserve to provide leadership on advancing the safety, efficiency and accessibility \nof the nation’s payment system. Congress initially designed the Fed to serve as a payments \nsystem operator through the regional Reserve Banks and as an overseer of the system through its \nsupervision of financial institutions. These roles give  the Fed relevant insights as we work with \nothers to address the security challenges we face today.  \n For its own part as an operator, the Fed must consider and ensure the security of its  own \nclearing and settlement activities , and thi s directly influence s a large segment of U.S. retail \n\n2 \n payments. The Fed’s financial services business also  provides resources to support development \nof payment standards, including those related to security.  And, there are  plans un derway to work \nwith the Fed’s financial  services  customers  to identify demand for enhanced risk -management \nproducts that complement the Federal Reserve’s suite of wire, automated clearinghouse  and \ncheck service offerings.  \nAs a payments system o verseer , the Federal Reserve and other agencies  ensure banks \nprotect their systems from unauthorized access to online banking systems and safeguard sensitive \npersonal or account information.  In the case of retail payment fraud, consumers have been \nprotected from significant losses by r egulations.  \nThese roles h ave informed the central bank and enhanced its credibility where it plays a \nless formal but equally important role —that of leader and  catalyst for change. The improvements \nwe seek for greater  security in the U .S. payments system do not stem from a specific  mandate \nfrom Congress , but rather from an interest in ensuring stability  and confidence in the payments \nsystem .   \nIn this role, t he Federal Reserve seeks to drive improvement in the payments system \nthrough a collaborative approach , which in the past has led to payments innovations that we take \nfor granted today. R outing numbers on paper checks, the development of the ACH , and the \nimplementation of Check 21 are all examples of diverse interests coming together to find a \nsolution to co mmon challenges.  \nIt is in this spirit that we recently established two task forces  to take on today’s \nchallenge s. These groups are comprised of diverse and committed membership, which will \nensure a broad range of perspectives are considered as we move forw ard. \n\n3 \n One task force will focus on identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a \nsafe, ubiquitous and faster payments capability in the United States. The other task force will \nprovide input on security aspects of a faster payments capability, an d serve as a forum to advise \nthe Federal Reserve on how to address security matters and to identify and promote actions that \ncan be taken by payment system participants collectively or by the Federal Reserve System.  \n An important question is: H ow will we judge success  of these efforts ? Each task force \nwill be asked to identify the criteria by which they will measure success. In the near-term, we \nwill look to the secure payments task force to articulate key priorities . We will also be looking \nfor evidence o f commitment from payments system participants to take action on these priorities.  \nLong er-term, we hope to see this collaboration among industry participants continue,  \nresulting in progress on the development and adoption of effective security standards. We would \nalso hope to see robust r esearch and implementation of processes that result in better data and the \nability to closely monitor fraud and identify adverse trends, develop more effective responses, \nand track policy initiatives.  Success will mean p ayments modernization in the U nited States  is \nwell on its way , with adoption that reflects the public’s strong confidence in new capabilities.  \nTime will tell whether this collaborative approach  can be successful or whether the Fed \nneeds to take a different approach to foster a modern payments system that serves the needs of a \ndynamic economy .  \nIt was t en years ago , in 2005, that the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosted  its \nfirst payments confe rence titled, “Interchange Fees in Credit and Debit Card Markets.”  During \nthe two da ys of presentations, discussion  and debate among leading economists, industry leaders \nand policymakers, the need for intervention in the credit and debit markets was hotly contested. \nBy 2010, Congress intervened with regulation.   \n\n4 \n As we conclude this conference on payments security, I sense a greater degree of \nconsensus around the security challenges we face. As the Federal Reserve begins the work of \nconven ing and engag ing with stakeholders  to achieve a faster, more secure  and widely available \npayments system , the pieces of the puzzle li e before us. Putting them together in a way that \nmaintains the public’s confidence is both our challenge and our opportunity."

I appreciate the opportunity to be here at the Central Exchange . The \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has enjoyed a long and productive relationship with this \norganization, and I applaud the Central Exchange’s important contributions to supporting women \nin our community as it celebrates its 35th anniversary  this year.  \nAs the national economy continues to expand, the Federal Reserve has turned its attention \nto the issues associated with normalizing monetary policy after years o f unprecedented \naccommodation. Preparing for the next phase of monetary policy has involved consider ation of  \nthe mechanics for raising rates, clear principles supporting the normalization process, and  now,  \nthe discussion about the appropriate timing of the first rate increase. In my remarks today, I’ll \noffer my views on the economy’s pro gress and the appropriate stance of  monetary policy. I will \nclose by offering some observations about recent calls for further transparency and \naccountability for the Federal Reserve .   \nThese are my own views and not those of the Feder al Open Market Commit tee or the \nFederal Reserve System.  \n \nThe e conomic outlook  \nThe U.S. economy is expand ing at an above -trend growth rate , which I expect to continue \nthrough the end of the year. A strong dollar and certain aspects of the  foreign ou tlook pose some \nrisks, but the economy appears  well positione d to withstand such headwinds.  \nThe economic outlook is positive for both consumers and businesses. Consumer \nconfidence strengthened markedly in the second half of last year as gas oline  prices declined and \nthe labor market improved, and we have seen an increased willingness to spend on discretionary \ngoods and services , such as restaurants and recreational activitie s. Household balance sheets \n\n2 \n continue to strengthen, which should support c onsumer spending. Meanwhile, businesses \nare reporting that it’s a good time to expand, with industrial capacity utilization hitting its \npre-recession rate and spending on research and development accelerating.   \nImportantly, this improved outlook for consu mers and businesses suggest s that \nmomentum in the labor market will likely continue going forward. The economy added \nmore than 3 million jobs in 2014, the highest level since 1999 , and the rapid pace of job \ncreation has continued into the beginning of 2015 .  \nAlong with this  strong employment growth , we’ve seen  significant improvement \nin the unemployment rate , which has fallen from 6.7 percent in December 2013 to 5.7 \npercent in January of this year. The current level is less than one-half percentage point \naway from what many vi ew as the long -run normal rate. With more than 5 million job \nopenings currently posted, there are now fewer  than two unemployed people per job \nopening, down from nearly seven per job opening during the depths of the financial \ncrisis.  Evidence from the last business cycle indicates that as this balance tilts toward a \ntighter labor market, wage pressures are likely to increase.  \nAlready, the rates at which people voluntary leave their jobs are  increasing a s \nemployers look to recruit workers  from other firms and workers look to increase their \nwages. For example, research by my staff shows that in the second half of 2014, \nindividuals who switched jobs saw their wages increase more than 5 percent compared to \nwhat they earned in the prior quarte r—a notable rise compared to a few years earlier. As \nmore workers quit their jobs and seek out higher -paying employment, wage pressures are \nlikely to broaden and further increase.  \n\n3 \n Of course,  while  these positive indicators are encouraging , the labor market is not \ncompletely back to normal. For example, the share of “long -term” unemployed and the number \nnumber of individuals working part -time for economic reasons remains elevated . These aspects \nof our labor market are concerning . As the economy con tinues to expand and the labor market \ntightens further, job opportunities should become more available for those who have had \ndifficulty securing full -time employment.    \nTo evaluate the health of the labor market  in a way that takes into account  both strong \nemployment growth and job-finding challenges for many others , my staff developed an index of \nlabor market conditions that includes  a range of variables —something like a stock market index \nfor the labor market. Th is approach  show s that momentum  in the  labor market is near its highest \nrate in two decades.  If momentum continues at this pace , the labor market will return to its \naverage level of activity later this year.  This does not mean that all labor markets indicators will \nbe back to pre -crisis levels or even their historical average, but on a broad basis, the labor market \nwill be close to what can be considered normal.  \nTypically , a growing economy and tightening labor market would be accompanied by \nrising inflation . That has not been the case recently. In terms of consumer price inflation, the \nFed’s preferred measure is running at 0. 25 percent year -over-year—down from the 1.5 percent \npace at the middle of last year. The recent sharp declines in oil prices are positive for economic \ngrowth, but lower energy prices are dampening headline measures of inflation. However, the \nimpact of these transitory factors should fade later this year, particularly as oil prices stabiliz e.  \nLooking beyond these temporary factors, other important components of inflation are \nmoving higher. Rental prices for housing  have been strong , for example, and are likely to \ncontinue rising. The strength in the labor market  I just mentioned  is also likely to lead to more \n\n4 \n rapid wage  gains . So while inflation is somewhat below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, I am \nnot overly concerned with this shortfall . Instead, I see current and forecast ed inflation as \ngenerally consistent with price stability.  \nAgainst a b ackdrop of the ongoing economic expansion, a strengthening labor \nmarket and low but firming inflation, it is reasonable to contemplate a shift in the stance \nof monetary policy.  Moving to the next phase of policy entails judgment  on both the \ntiming of the first rate increase and then the pace of future increases —issues  that the \nFederal Open Market Committee will deliberate carefully.  \n \nThe liftoff decision  \nThe labor market, as I’ve highlighted, has experienced substantial improvement \nover the past year.  But in earlier stages of the recovery, much of the emphasis was on a \nweak labor market as the d river of accommodative policy. For example, we implemented \na number of bond -buying programs, commonly referred to as “QE 1, 2, and 3,”  held the \nfederal funds rate near  zero since the end of 2008, and relied on various iterations of \n“forward guidance” to signal our intentions that short -term rates would remain \naccommodative. Until March of last year, forward guidance for keeping short -term rates \nnear zero  hinged on a 6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold. In addition, the last \nlarge -scale asset purchase program was tied to achieving substantial improvement in the \noutlook for the labor market. This past October, we took the first steps towards \nnorma lization by ending the bond -buying program s.  \nNow with the economy approaching full employment , attention has turned to \nmoving inflation back towards the 2 percent goal. Rather than focusing solely on either \n\n5 \n employment or inflation,  policy needs to take a balanced approach, as is clearly codified in the \nFed’s Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. The balanced approach \nsuggests that temporary deviations of unemployment and inflation  from their longer -run values  \ndo not necessarily warran t an extreme policy  setting . Instead, the stance of policy needs to take \ninto account the magnitudes of any deviations, as well as how long any deviation is expected to \nlast. Currently, unemployment is not far from its longer -run level , and the lower rate of headline \ninflation is expected to be temporary. And as I’ve mentioned, monetary policy should look \nthrough temporary factors, such as the oil price decline, as long as there is reasonable confidence \nthat inflation will be moving towards 2 percent within  the forecast horizon and that longer -term \ninflation expectations remain stable.  \nThis balanced approach framework supports  taking steps to remov e the extraordinary \namount of monetary accommodation currently in place . The next phase in this process is to move \nthe federal funds rate off its near -zero setting . While the FOMC has made no decisions about the \ntiming of this action , I continue to support liftoff  towards the middle of this year due to \nimprovement in the labor market, expectations of firmer inflat ion, and the balance of risks over  \nthe medium and longer run.  \nLiftoff in the middle of this year , in my view , would be fully consistent with the FOMC’s \nStatement on Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which reminds the public that “monetary \npolicy actions  tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. ” This means some time \nwill pass before we can see the effects of interest rate decisions, so mo netary policy must be \nforward -looking  and act  before the economy reaches full employment and 2 percen t inflation . \nWaiting until economic conditions are nearly  back to normal before raising rates  may put policy \nbehind the curve and require rates to rise rapidly in the future.  \n\n6 \n Another factor supporting liftoff in the near future is that many  of the benchmarks \npolicymakers use to assess the appropriate level of short -term rates  indicate  rates should \nbe above zero.  These benchmarks signal liftoff even after accounting for some possible \nchanges in the economy, such as a slower trend rate of grow th stemming from \ndemographic change and a more modest pace of productivity growth.   \n \nAfter l iftoff  \nAlthough considerable attention is now centered on the timing of raising rates, \nthis step is only one of many in the policy normalization process . Every interest rate  \ndecision depends on how the economy unfolds , so simply deciding to make the first \ninterest rate move b y no means puts interest rate decisions on autopilot.  At the same time, \npolicymakers can’t perpetually wait for just “one more dat a point,” so actions often must \nbe taken in anticipation of how economic conditions are expected to develop.  \nThe FOMC will need to be forward -looking in determining the pace of  remov ing \naccommodation. Unique to the extraordinary amount of monetary stimulus that exists \ntoday, it is important to emphasize these steps are a “removal of accommodation” and not \n“tightening .” I see r aising the federal funds rate off zero in the middle of this year as a \nstep to normalize financial conditions  alongside a strengthenin g economy , rather than an \nattempt to slow an overheating economy. The alternative of m oving rates off zero much \nlater, but raising them at a faster pace, risks disrupting financial market  and sharply  \nslowing economic activity . For that reason, I see more balanced risks under an approach \nthat raises rates sooner , such as in the middle  of this year, but  at a gradual pace. \n \n\n7 \n Conclusion  \nAs the Federal Reserve  contemplates its path to normalizing monetary policy, it does so \nat a time of tremendou s public scrutiny. There are c alls for more transparency and accountability \nrelated to its monetary policy  and its supervision and regulation of large financial institutions.  \nAs a result, changes to Fed structure and governance are being contemplated by C ongress.   \nTo be sure, accountability and the public’s scrutiny of the Federal Reserve are to be \nexpected and appropriate.  It is well understood that securing the public’s trust and confidence \ndepends on the  central bank’ s ability to meet its mandates from Congress. But contemplated \nchanges should be focused in a way that does not compromise the Federal Reserve’s key \nstrengths , including an independent FOMC and a decentralized structure. Broad-based \nrepresentation, public oversight and the ability of policymakers to bring independent views to the \ntable  have been enduring features of the system and have proven to be a source of strength for \nthe nation ’s central bank . It would be a mistake to alter that b alance without thoughtful and \ncaref ul consideration ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Stability Institute/Bank for International Settlements  \nAsia-Pacific High -Level Meeting  \nManila, Philippines  \nFebruary 10, 2015  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits gov ernors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n \n1 \n Today’s program focuses on various aspects of reforms since the global financial crisis \nthat aim to address the risks posed to financial and economic stability.  Central banks have long \nrecognized that financial stabili ty considerations play a key role in achieving monetary policy \nobjectives.  Yet, there remains considerable debate about the role that monetary policy itself \ncontributes to financial stability and what steps a central bank should take with its policy regime .  \nIn my remarks today, I will review considerations on the interaction between financial \nstability and mone tary policy , as well as the post -crisis enthusiasm for the use of \nmacroprudential regulatory approaches  in addition to supervision of individual banking firms . I \nwill conclude with my own views on the role of monetary policy in assuring economic objectives \nare achieved in the context of financial stability.  \n \nThe relationship between monetary policy and financial s tability  \nPrior to the recent global financial crisis, a common view held that monetary policy \nshould not lean against apparent financial market imbalances —except to the extent they affected \nthe ou tlook for growth and inflation —but, instead , clean up after a bubble bursts . This line of \nthinking rested on t hree assumptions .  \nThe first is that spotting asset price bubbles or financial imbalances in real -time is \nnotoriously difficult —something that is just as true today as in the past. Knowing a t what point \nand how aggressively to intervene using monetary policy also poses a number of practical \nchallenges. A second assumption  is that monetary policy can be effective at limiting the damage \nto the broader economy after the bursting of an asset -price bubble . The pre -crisis consensus \nviewed  a collapse of asset prices as having the potential to inflict  sustained damage to the \nbroader economy, but also held that monetary policy could mitigate the fallout.  A third \n\n \n2 \n assumption  supporting the pre -crisis  consensus  is what  I will call “the separation principle,” in \nwhich regulators concern themselves with oversight of the financial sector  while monetary \npolicy makers  focus on macroeconomic objectives, such as inflation and , in some cases, \nemployment.  The goal of price stability was seen as largely complementary with that of financial \nstability, given a well -designed regulatory structure that monitored the risk exposure s of the \nfinancial sector.    \nGiven these assumptions, b roader discussions on the role of central banks in fostering \nfinancial stability were rare.  The bursting of the dot -com bubble of the 1990s , followed by the \nrelatively mild recession in 2001 only reinforced these views.  After many years of financial \nmarket stability  in advanced economies , policymakers seemed to have reason to view monetary \npolicy as appropriately focused on macroeconomic objectives —that is, until the onset of the \nglobal financial crisis that began in 2007 . \nThe collapse of the housing market in the United States a nd the global economic events  \nthat followed have posed fundamental challenge s to the thinking about the role of monetary \npolicy in maintain ing financial stability. And w ithout doubt, financial instability inflicted \ndamage that pulled many central banks far from their objectives  for a prolonged period . \n \nA macropr udential approach  \nToday , central banks are digesting a growing body of research on the appropriate roles  of \nmonetary and regulatory  policy  in fostering financial stability . The influence  of this research  on \nactual monetary policy decis ions has been only modest , although financial  stability concerns are \nbecoming more frequently discussed in the context of monetary policy. For example, the Federal \nReserve has adopted a Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy , which \n\n \n3 \n convey s to the public the objectives of monetary policy. The statement says  that “risks to the \nfinancial system” that threaten to impede attainment of the Committee’ s longer -run goals may \nwarrant a monetary poli cy response. No adjustment to policy has yet been made due to risks \nfrom the financial sector.  \nHowever, s ome countries over the past few years have raised financial stability concerns \nto a level sufficient to warrant a policy response. In most  cases, monetary policy was not altered. \nInstead, macroprudential tools were deployed to address overheating property markets or rising \nhousehold indebtedness.  Monetary policy has largely remained focused on inflation and \nemployment , leaving financial stability to  regulators and their macroprudential approaches ; in \nother words , the separation principle remains largely intact.  \nIn fact, the deployment of macroprudential tools  may be perceived as further removing \nthe need for monetary policy to be concerned with financial stability . For example, \ncountercyclical capital policy can be used to reduce the banking sector’s leverage and expand its \nloss-absorbing capacity  during an ex pansion. Calibrating t he appropriate timing and degree for \nusing this tool , however, poses  some  practical challenges  that are similar to those associated with \nmonetary policy . The Federal Reserve plans to  use a framework incorporating countercyclical  \ncapital adjustments , though details, such as when and by how much to releas e the buffer , will \nneed to be more fully developed.  \nIn addition to countercyclical capital, policymakers and regulators  have embraced \nmacroprudential approaches to liquidity requir ements . These steps are designed to guard against \nexcess ive maturity transformation , which in the past has led to asset fire sales and large swings \nin asset valuations.  With the new rules, banks must hold a minimum amount of highly liquid \n\n \n4 \n assets  under stre ssed conditions to ensure adequate funding and prevent fire sale losses and \nrelated externalities.    \nTo evaluate whether the capital and liquidity  positions of individual institutions aggregate \nto a stable banking system, s tress-testing has been used . In the United States, s tress-testing has \nlong been a microprudential tool aimed at ensuring the safety and soundness of individual \ninstitutions  and understanding , for example,  a bank’s interest rate risk exposure.  Since the crisis, \nit has also become an impor tant macroprudential tool that provides a  horizontal view of \nsystemically  important firms and their vulnerabilities to a wide variety of shocks to economic \nand financial conditions.  While stress -testing has proven to be a valuable tool, the results can be \nquite sensitive to a number of factors , such as model specifications and estimation periods.  For \nthese reasons, regulators should be cautious about taking too much reassurance from the tests.   \nRegulators also must remain focused on traditional microprudent ial, or firm -specific,  \nsupervision and regulation.  Sound execution of macroprudential regulation depends on sound \nmicroprudential regulation.  Ensuring that individual banking organizations are operating in a \nsafe and sound manner  is a prerequisite  to their ability to withstand the economic and financial \nshocks that can lead to financial instability.  In the U nited States , perhaps the most notable \nexamples were the declines in residential and commercial mortgage underwriting standards that \nemerged in the  years leading up to the crisis.  For commercial real estate, in particular, growing \nconcentrations led the banking agencies to issue supervisory guidance in 2006.  However, \nhighlighting such issues is of little value unless it is timely and accompanied by t argeted actions  \nto limit the risk exposure . From this standpoint, I see extremely strong complements between \nmicro - and macroprudential regulation.  \n \n\n \n5 \n Financial stability and monetary policy i nteractions  \nJust a s micro - and macroprudential polic ies play central role s in safeguarding financial \nstability, so does  monetary policy . I often hear t he view  that macroprudential policy should be \nthe “first line of defense” for maintaining financial st ability . Unfortunately , this approach  expect s \ntoo much of tools for which our understanding is imperfect . In addition,  a growing body of \nresearch shows monetary policy plays a key role in affecting risk appetite and risk premiums . \nAsking regulators to ensure  risk-taking is not endangering  financial stability places a large \nburden on our regulatory infrastructure , especially in an environment of highly accommodative \nmonetary policy . \n Indeed, central banks have used zero interest rates and large -scale asset purchases or \nquantitative easing as a type of monetary easing  that would affect  risk-taking , asset valuations \nand economic growth. While accommodative monetary policy can affect  economic activity via \nthis channel, it can also create financial market vulnerabilities , especially if  sustained  for a \nprolonged period. If financial imbalances in one sector turn out to have systemic consequences, \nthen a reliance on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity \ncould prove more detrimental than beneficial over the longer run  for achieving stable inflation \nand employment .  \nIn particular, a  monetary policy that f ails to take into account building systemic or tail \nrisks exposes the economy to potential large setbacks in the future. Investors fluctuate between \nbeing more or less conc erned about  these  unlikely —but severe —economic  outcomes. These \nconcerns are often incorporated  in risk premiums , which  reflect investor concerns about the \ndegree and likelihood of severe events . For example,  a rise in risk premiums can indicate a \nrecession may be on the horizon, even when macro economic data may be providing no such \n\n \n6 \n signal.  Alternatively, u nusually low risk premiums, such as were experienced in 2003 -2005, \nreflected investors who were underestimating the severity and likelihood of a downturn in the \nhousing market.  \nResearch points to the effect monetary policy has on several aspec ts of risk -taking. For \nexample, after t aking into account economic conditions, low policy rates are correlated with \noverall easier financial conditions, as we see banks increase the share of risky assets they hold,  \ncredit quality  decline , risk premium s on syndicated  loans  fall, lending standards  soften , and \nfinancial institutions move towards shorter -term funding and higher  leverage.1 Many of these \nfactors manifest themselves in elevated asset valuations and rising credit growth. Once asset \nvalues or credit growth has risen to a level warranting concern, it is likely too late for monetary \npolicy to smoothly  unwind these imbalanc es without  triggering a sharp reversal that ultimately  \ninflict s damage on the real economy.  \nA focus on risk-taking and risk premiums in the context of monetary policy leads to two \nquestions. The first is whether risk premiums are useful for predicting economic activity. \nResearch from  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  suggests they are, but they offer more \nof a signal about  the future when they are rising than when they are falling.2 That is, rising risk \npremiums signal poor economic performance in  the future, while declining risk premiums are not \nnecessarily a good indicator  of strong economic performance. Low risk premiums, however, may \nsow the seeds for future financial instability. The second question is whether monetary policy \ncan affect risk p remiums. This same line of r esearch also suggests monetary policy  does alter \nrisk premiums. As policy eases, risk premiums have a tendency to decline , suggest ing that \n                                                           \n1 See, for example, Rajan (2005); Jimenez et al (2012);  Santos (2012) ; Maddaloni and Peydo (2011) ; Stein (2012, \n2013); Adrian and Shin (2010);  Adrian, Moench and Shin (2009). Adrian and Laing (2014) provide a \ncomprehensive overview.  \n2 See Cao, Doh and Molling, “Should Monetary Policy Look at Risk Premiums in Financial Market s?” forthcoming \nin the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review .  \n\n \n7 \n attempt s to lower  already low risk premiums will likely do little in te rms of future econ omic \nactivity  but may foster conditions that pose risks to  financial stability.  \nThis line of thinking suggests to me that modestly tighter policy earlier in the business \ncycle expansion could moderate risk -taking and the potential for destabilizing financial \nimbalances to build.  In reviewing financial stability reports for several countries prior to the \nglobal financial crisis, my staff found some countries effectively identified a number of  risks  that \nplayed  important roles in the crisis but underes timated their severity .3 Identifying “excess” risk -\ntaking always carries challenges, particularly in finding the right benc hmark with which to assess \nrisk-taking. Still, a number of these reports highlighted risks,  but late in the business cycle when \nthere was little monetary policy could do except wait to clean up. In addition,  using monetary \npolicy to prick bubbles  after they have developed , to slow elevated levels of credit growth, or to \nencourage firms to scale back on high levels of leverage are likely to end poorly.  \nThe bottom line is that it is difficult  to address stability concerns in particular sectors \nafter they have developed. Instead, it may be appropriate to adjust policy to address suppressed \nrisk premiums early in the expansion  rather than late. Once valuation pressures emerge, or \nunderwriting standards have been stretched, then it is often too late.  As a result, interest rate \npolicy used earlier in the cycle can foster a more stable financial land scape as a business cycle \nmatures.  \n \n \n \nRevisiting the pre -crisis c onsensus  \n                                                           \n3 Christensson, Spong, and Wilkenson, “Financial Stability Reports: How Useful During a Financial Crisis?” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Economic Review , 2010.  \n\n \n8 \n  The lessons of the financial crisis are many and warrant careful assessment of \nassumptions that have guide d the thinking about the proper relationship between monetary policy \nand financial stability. It remains true that w e can’t identify bubbles in real time, or at least don’t \nknow the proper time and manner to intervene to stem their rise. Following the collapse o f a \nbubble, monetary policy can be judiciously used to limit the damage inflict ed on the real \neconomy. However, monetary policy runs the risk of  remaining overly accommodative  following \na downturn , and lead to  future  instability . Importantly, policymakers should reassess the \nassumption that monetary policy and macroprudential regimes can be used independently.  This \n“separation principle” remains widely accepted  and continues to argue that macroprudential tools  \noffer the “first line of defense” against risks  to financial stability .  \nOur recent experience, combined with empirical evidence , suggests this view should be \nchallenged.  A comprehensive approach that views m onetary  and macroprudential policy as a \ncomplements, reinforced by sound microprudential underp innings , is the best approach to \nachiev e a stable financial system and the long -run objectives of central banks for sustainable \neconomic growth ."

George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommunity  Banking  in the 21st Century  \nConference  hosted  by the Federal  Reserve  System  and the Conference  of State  Bank  Supervisors  \nSt. Louis,  Mo. \nSept.  23, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n It is a pleasure  to be invited  to participate  in today’s  conference.  The Kansas  City Fed’s  \nseven -state district  is home  to some  900 banks  with less than $1 billion  of assets,  which  is 17 \npercent  of the nation’s  small  banks.  With  combined  assets  of about  $150  billion,  these  banks \nrepresent  just 1 percent  of total industry  assets.  However,  size comparisons  understate  their \nimport ant contribution  to the region al and nation al economy.   \nCommunity  banks  in our region  help finance  farmers  who contribute  to 12 percent  of the \nnation’s  agricultural  output  as well as oil and gas businesses  that account  for 16 percent  of \ndomestic  energy  output.  These  banks  also are particularly  critical  for home owners  and business  \noperators  in rural  areas  because  of their willingness  to meet  the demand  for tailored,  nonstandard  \nmortgages  and for small  business  loans.   \nThere  are more  than 5,000  such banks  in the United  States.  As the national  economy  \nstrengthens,  community  banks  are prepared  to resume  their important  role in their communities  \nand the broader  economy.   However,  they argue  that the regulatory  environment  has thrown  sand \nin the gears  of efficiently  and competitively  meeting  the credit  needs  of their communities.   \nFour  years  ago, the regulatory  reform  known  as the Dodd -Frank  Act (DFA)  was passed.  \nWith  its aim squarely  focused  on addressing  the supervision  and regulation  of the largest  \nfinancial  institutions,  the law and its architects  acknowledged  that small  banks  were  neither  the \ncause  of the crisis  nor the target  of reforms.  And to that end, the DFA  expressly  exempted  small  \nbanks  from  its reach.  So, why since  then have  community  banks  increasingly  become  concerned  \nand vocal  about  regulatory  burden  as a threat  to their ability  to serve  the credit  needs  of their \ncommunities  and, ultimately,  to their viability?   \nThis growing  chorus  of concern  and frustration  about  regulatory  burden  has gotten  the \nattention  of policymakers  and regulators.  Federal  banking  regulators  all agree  that calibrating  \n\n2 \n supervision  for community  banks  is appropriate  and important,  and they express  genuine  \nsympathy  for the need  to apply  the right  balance  to the supervision  and regulation  of small  \nbanks.   \nYet, in spite  of legislators’  and regulators’  best intentions,  customers  and communities  \nthat rely on smaller  banks  for access  to credit  are feeling  the weight  of regulatory  burden,  and \nbankers  are pleading  for relief.  Industry  advocates  have  identified  a number  of specific  remedies,  \nand efforts  are underway  to consider  how they might  be implemented.  For its part, the Federal  \nReserve  has likewise  expressed  its commitment  to a deeper  understanding  of these  issues,  \nincluding  its partnership  with the Conference  of State  Bank  Supervisors  in this forum  today.  I \ncommend  such efforts  and look forward  to the research  insights  and other  learning  from  this \nprogram.   \nIn my remarks  today,  I will offer  my own views  on the regulatory  burden  dilemma  facing  \nsmall  banks,  their regulators  and legislators,  and why it is proving  to be so difficult  to address  in \na meaningful  way.  I will also offer  my perspective  on a way forward  to ensure  that regulation  \nretains  its objectives  for public  interest  and the safety  of the banking  system.  Before  going  \nfurther,  I need  to note that my comments  today  are my views  only and not those  of the Federal  \nReserve  System  or its Board  of Governors,  which  is charged  with bank  regulation  \nresponsibilities.  \n \nThe aim of regulation  \nThe aim of bank  regulation  in the United  States  is both to protect  the public  and foster  an \nefficient  competitive  banking  system.  Similar  to the backdrop  for the DFA,  much  of the U.S. \nregulatory  system  developed  in response  to financial  crises  and other  events.   \n\n3 \n Generally  speaking,  bank  regulation  is designed  to protect  depositors,  ensure  monetary  \nand financial  stability,  provide  for an efficient  and competitive  financial  system  and protect  \nconsumers.  It is not intended  to keep  banks  from  failing  or to hinder  banks  from  taking  risks  in \nmeeting  the needs  of their customers  and efficiently  allocating  credit.1   \nStriking  an appropriate  balance  between  regulation,  banking  and policy  has always  been  \na struggle.   In that regard,  today’s  environment  is no different.  Tension  has long existed  between  \nallowing  banks  suffic ient flexibility  to adapt  to a rapidly  changing  environment  while  \nmaintaining  a regulatory  framework  that ensures  financial  stability  and adequate  consumer  \nprotection.   \nGetting  that balance  right  is critical.  History  offers  any number  of examples  of well-\nintended  regulation  resulting  in unintended  outcomes.  For example,  the 1999  Gramm -Leach -\nBliley  Act that allowed  banking  organizations  to expand  into nonbank  financial  activities  aimed  \nto allow  banks  to diversify  and reduce  risk. Instead,  as we learned  from  the financial  crisis,  \nsubstantial  increases  in risk-taking,  leverage  and business -model  complexity  increased  financial  \nfragility.   \nLikewise,  the Basel  capital  requirements  allowed  the largest  banks  to use internal  models  \nto calculate  their own risk weights  for risk-based  capital  requirements,  in part, “to build  upon  and \nfurther  encourage  investments  banks  are already  making  in their internal  risk management  \nsystems.”2 While  the intent  was to improve  risk management  and better  align  capital  ratios  with \nportf olio risk, the result  was regulatory  arbitrage  and leverage  ratios  that proved  inadequate  \nrelative  to the risks  that many  of the largest  banks  took leading  into the crisis.    \n                                                 \n1 For an in-depth  review  of the purposes  of bank  regulation  as well as what  bank  regulation  is not intended  to do, see \nKenneth  Spong,  Banking  Regulation:  Its Purposes,  Implementation,  and Effects , Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  \nCity,  2000.  \n2 See William  J. McDonough,  “Implementing  the New  Basel  Accord,” remarks  to the Global  Association  of Risk \nProfessionals,  Feb. 11, 2003.  \n\n4 \n Getting  the right  balance  for banking  regulation  is not easy.  Legislators  and regulators  \nface the growing  challenge  of regulating  an industry  that over the past three  decades  has become  \nhighly  concentrated  and engaged  in activities  that range  from  traditional  lending  to complex  \nfinance.  While  commercial  banks  of all sizes  benefit  from  public  safety  nets, the operating  \nmodels,  activities,  and risk profiles  they employ  vary widely.  Indeed,  community  banks  are not \nsmaller  versions  of the country’s  largest  banks.  If our regulatory  apparatus  is going  to effectively  \nmeet  its aims,  policymaker s must  understand  how these  commercial  banking  business  models  \noperate  and why a locally -owned  community  bank  is not the same  as a branch  of a systemically  \nimportant  financial  institution  in meeting  the credit  needs  of the local  community.   \n \nUnderstanding  relationship  banking  \nThe community  bank  business  model  is often  described  as relationship  banking.  \nCommunity  bankers  typically  have  long-term,  direct  relationships  with their customers  that \nprovide  the detailed  knowledge  about  their character,  reputation  and history.  This is necessary  to \nmake  informed,  qualitative  assessments  about  credit  quality.  These  relationships  allow  \ncommunity  banks  to tailor  loans  and other  services  to their customers.   \n Many  community  banks  also are closely  held institutions  with the top management  and \nboard  members  having  significant  ownership  positions.  These  ownership  incentives  shape  the \nbank’s  culture  and help to ensure  that its key policymakers  are focused  on achieving  good  \nperformance,  avoiding  excessive  risk-taking,  and suppo rting  the health  of their communities.  \nStudies  by staff at our Reserve  Bank  on ownership  and management  structure  find that the \n\n5 \n better -performing  and safer  community  banks  are those  where  the major  decision  makers  have  \nmuch  to lose if they do not make  the right  decisions.3   \nI often  hear that such a business  model  is becoming  less economical  in a world  that is fast \npaced  and increasingly  transactions -based.  However,  research  from  our Reserve  Bank  presented  \nhere at last year’s  conference  shows  there  is real value  in relationship  lending  and in the soft \npersonal  information  on customers  that community  bankers  typically  have.4 This business  model  \nis one in which  the incentives  of banks  are aligned  with outcomes  that benefit  their customers  \nand the economy.  When  incentives  are aligned  in this way,  the need  for an “ability  to repay”  \nrule, for example,  seems  unnecessary.   \nAnother  defining  feature  of community  banking  is its business  model  transparency.  \nTraditional  bank  lending  is inherently  opaque  because  it is based on the inside,  non-public  \ninformation  that bankers  gain from  their relationships  with borrowers,  but the business  model  \nneed  not be opaque.  In contrast  to the largest  banks,  community  bank  shareholders,  creditors,  \ncustomers  and regulators  find it relati vely easy to monitor  and verify  risks.  Management  \noversight  and market  discipline  are much  more  effective  with such a transparent  business  model.  \nEmployees  know  what  is expected;  regulators  are better  able to thoroughly  examine  the bank,  \nidentify  risks  and recommend  appropriate  corrective  actions  as needed.  \nFinally,  to understand  the community  bank  business  model  is to understand  that failure  is \nan option  when  risks  are poorly  managed.  This feature  offers  a powerful  incentive  to manage  \nrisk. To be sure,  community  banks  don’t  always  get it right,  and history  points  to their failures,  \n                                                 \n3 Robert  DeYoung,  Kenneth  Spong,  Richard  J.

Fortunately,  an efficient  resolution  process  is \navailable  to minimize  the cost to their communities  and customers,  maintain  essential  banking  \nservices  and retain  public  confidence.  \n \nThe reality  of the current  regulatory  environment  \nThe business  model  of community  banks  no longer  dominates  the commercial  banking  \nindustry.  Regulation  has expanded  to address  the size, concentration  and complexity  of the \nlargest  banks.  Unfortunately,  it also has impinged  on thousands  of community  and regional  \nbanks.    \nThe issue  is whether  we can effectively  achieve  desired  outcomes  for all commercial  \nbanks  under  the current  regulatory  framework,  or whether  we will try to further  bifurcate  the \nsystem  with separate  rules  for the largest  banks  and community  banks.  We face a decision  about  \nthe path forward.  Based  on my own experience,  I would  offer  three  observations  about  the nature  \nof today’s  regulatory  environment  that weigh  most  heavily  on community  banks  in the interest  of \nframing  potential  remedies.    \nMy first observation  is that the rules  are increasingly  prescriptive  and complex.  In a \nglobal  market  for finance  and commerce,  regulators  have  responded  to a larger,  more  \nconcentrated  and complex  banking  industry  with more  complicated  rules.  However,  the value  of \nthis complexity  is questionable.  In the case of capital  rules—a key component  of regulation  and \nbank  safety—recent  empirical  and theoretical  research  shows  that simpler  capital  rules  are better.  \nFor example,  researchers  at the Bank  of England  and Organisation  for Economic  Cooperation  \nand Development  have  shown  that simple  leverage  ratios  are better  than risk-based  ratios  in \n\n7 \n predicting  default.5 Researchers  at the Bank  of England  also have  shown  that theoretically  \ncomplicated  rules  can lead to worse  results  when  granular  measures  of asset  risk do not account  \nfor correlations  among  a bank’s  asset  portfolio  or when  models  attempt  to estimate  risk \nparameters  for risks  that are unknowable.6 \nLong  before  Basel  III was adopted,  community  banks  were  considered  well capitalized  \nand their risks  well understood.  They  remain  so today.  For example,  banks  with less than $1 \nbillion  of assets  had a Tier 1 leverage  ratio of 9.5 percent  in 1996,  and today  it is 10.5 percent.  \nEven  so, community  banks  must  adopt  the more  complicated  capital  rules  with finer  degrees  of \nrisk weights  and capital  buffers.  The risk-weighted  asset  schedule  of the call report  has 57 rows  \nand 89 pages  of instructions  yet no additional  capital  was required  for the majority  of community  \nbanks.  \nIn addition  to the higher  compliance  costs  associated  with these  capital  rules,  community  \nbanks  continue  to hold higher  levels  of capital  than the largest  banks. Unless  and until the largest  \nbanks  achieve  commensurate  levels  of capital  (inclusive  of their off-balance -sheet  assets),  they \nretain  a capital -ratio advantage  over community  and regional  banks  that is far more  powerful  \nthan the funding  cost subsidy  confirmed  in a recent  Government  Accountability  Office  study.   \nMy second  observation  is that regulation  and supervisory  frameworks  have  evolved  with \nfar less reliance  on examiner  experience  and supervisory  judgment  and more  emphasis  on data-\ndriven,  econometr ic models  and measurement  to produce  a more  systematic,  objective  and \n                                                 \n5 See Andrew  Haldane,  “Constraining  Discretion  in Bank  Regulation ,” Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Atlanta  Conference  \non “Maintaining  Financial  Stability:  Holding  a Tiger  by the Tail(s),”  April  9, 2013 ; and Adrian  Blundell -Wignall,  \nPaul Atkinson,  and Caroline  Roulet,  “Bank  Business  Models  and the Basel  System : Complexity  and \nInterconnectedness ,” OECD  Journal:  Financial  Market  Trends , Vol. 2014  – Issue  2. \n6 See Andrew  Haldane  in note 5 and David  Aikman,  Mirta  Galesic,  Gerd  Gigerenzer,  Sujit  Kapadia,  \nKonstantinos  Katsikopoulos,  Amit  Kothiyal,  Emma  Murphy,  and Tobias  Neumann,  “Taking  Uncertainty  Seriously:  \nSimplicity  Versus  Complexity  in Financial  Regulation ,” Financial  Stability  Paper  No. 28, Bank  of England,  May \n2014.   \n \n\n8 \n standardized  approach  to supervision.  For the enhanced  supervision  of the country’s  largest  \nbanks,  this approach  has been  considered  highly  successful,  for example,  in making  assessments  \nabout  capital  adequacy  under  stress  test scenarios.  However,  for community  bank  supervision,  \nthe substitution  of rigid  rules  for examiner  judgment  has altered  the supervisory  process  without  \nadding  value  and has instead  created  higher  costs  of compliance.   \nAppraisal  requirements  have  been  cited  as an example  in this regard.  Over  the last two \ndecades,  the required  use of appraisals  has expanded  in response  to the 1990s  savings  and loans  \ncrisis  and the 2008  financial  crisis.  For real estate  in larger  metropo litan areas,  market  values  can \nbe readily  determined.  For real estate  in smaller  communities,  especially  rural  communities,  \nthere  may in fact be no “objective”  market  price.  Despite  this difference,  appraisal  regulation  is \nrigid  and restricts  the kind of judgment -based  lending  that facilitates  lending  to small  businesses  \nand individuals  in rural  and other  small  community  markets.  \nMy third  observation  is related  to the nature  of consumer  compliance  regulation,  and here \nI worry  the pendulum  has swung  too far.  To be sure,  regulation  has an important  role to play in \nconsumer  protection  and fair access  to credit.  Those  protections  should  not be diluted,  especially  \nfor banks  that rely on model -based  consumer  lending.  However,  for banks  that depend  on \nrelationship  lending  with customized  terms  and conditions,  the regulations  and the focus  on \nidentifying  specific  undesirable  products  seems  to run counter  to the requisite  subjectivity  that \nunderlies  the strengths  of community  bank  lending.  Mortgage  lending,  UDAAP  (Unfair, \nDeceptive,  or Abusive  Acts or Practices) , CRA  (Community  Reinvestment  Act) and fair lending  \nmust  not only protect  consumers  from  bad actors,  but allow  consumers  to be served  where  \nsubjectivity  is required.  Unfortunately,  I frequently  hear community  bankers  expressing  concern  \nthat compliance  reviews  have  taken  a more  prosecutorial  tone.  As one banker  noted,  these  \n\n9 \n reviews  have  forced  bank  customers  to prove  they aren’t  crooks  and bankers  to prove  to \nregulators  that they aren’t  deceptive  and unfair.     \n \nMoving  forward  \nIn making  these  observations,  I share  the desire  on the part of both bankers  and regulators  \nto find meaningful  solutions.  Community  banks  have  become  entangled  in a web of reforms  \nintended  to address  the risks  in the largest  banks.  These  reforms  respond  to a business  model  \nemployed  by a few large,  globally  active  banks,  but have  created  spillovers  for community  \nbanks.  Although  it is enticing  to contemplate  the construction  of separate  rules  and frameworks  \nthat reflect  these  different  business  models  and risks,  commercial  banks  of all sizes  remain  \nbeneficiaries  of a public  safety  net. For that reason,  I believe  community  banks  have  a vested  \ninterest  in seeing  that regulatory  reforms  move  ahead  to ensure  that the largest  banks  are well \ncapitaliz ed, well supervised,  well managed  and subject  to failure.  Achieving  that end will serve  \nthe public  well.  While  that work  is underway,  regulators  must  also allow  examiner  judgment  and \ncommon  sense  to play a greater  role in their supervisory  regimes  for comm unity  banks.  \nI’m often  told that the world  has become  more  complicated,  that we have  too many  banks  \nin the U.S. and that we cannot  go back  to less-complex  and more -straightforward  regulation  and \nrules  and greater  supervisory  judgment.   I’m not convinced.   One of the best responses  to that \nassertion  was from  Sir Mervyn  King,  the former  governor  of the Bank  of England.  Although  his \nreference  was made  in the context  of finding  a solution  to the issue  of too big to fail, the same  \nmight  be said for addressing  the regulatory  environment  more  generally.  He said, “There  are \nthose  who claim  that such proposals  are impractical.  It is hard to see why.  … What  does seem  \nimpractical,  however,  are the current  arrangements.”"

It is an honor to address such a \ndistinguished group on an important topic. Given the events of the past several years, this \nconference’s focus on “Frameworks for Cen tral Banking in the Next Century” is certainly  fitting.  \nCentral banks are grappling to apply the lessons of history in the context of today’s economic \nrealities, and I expect this forum will contribute importantly to that essential evolution.   \nOne issue that the crisis has pushed to the forefront is the relationship between \nmacroeconomics and finance, and how we think about the footings of financial stability . My \ncomments this evening will focus briefly on this intersection of monetary policy an d supervisory \nand regulatory issues. I am convinced that promoting financial stability requires a comprehensive  \napproach that uses both macroprudential tools and the examination of individual firms, relying \non the judgment of experienced examiners. In addi tion, I am skeptical of a clean “separation \nprinciple” that places financial stability squarely in the purview of the supervisors. Instead, I \nthink monetary policymakers also need to maintain a careful eye on the financial system and \nhow interest rate poli cy affects incentives for financial markets and institutions.  \nAs usual, my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe path of policy and incentives  \nA primary  mission of financial regulators and supervisors is to foster financial stability \nby monitoring the health of individual financial institutions.  Broader financial conditions also \nplay an important role in achieving these objectives.  In some respects, financial institutions are \nstronger today than prior to the crisis, but I remain concerned about how the stance of monetary \npolicy is affecting the ir incentives and attitudes toward risk.  As a result of near-zero interest rates \n\n \n2 \n for five years , the profitab ility of traditional banking activities is strained  and incentives to reach \nfor yield are tempting . Net interest margins continue to trend lower and are at their lowest level \nin 30 years . Banks are responding as we should expect , which is to say they are engaging in \nriskier activities. For example, an all -time high of  $600 billion of  leveraged loans were issue d in \n2013. This lending is often characterized by weaker underwriting standards, including higher \ndebt ratios and fewer covenant provisions.  \nThe incentives to reach for yield extend to smaller financial institutions  as well . \nCommercial banks with assets of less than $50 billion have increased exposure to interest rate \nrisk, due in part to the guidance the FOMC has provided regarding future interest rates. Today, \n53 percent  of the securities and loans held by these banks have maturities of more than three \nyears, compared to about 37  percent  back in 2005. If longer -term interest rates we re to suddenly \nmove higher, the se institutions could face heavy losses.  These conditions create a challenging \nclimate for supervisors. Not only are they implement ing many new rules associated with \nregulatory reform , but they also are monitor ing these and other areas of increased risk -taking.    \nHaving just painted a picture where the extended, low-rate environment adversely affects \ntraditional banking activities,  the question is , What steps might be taken to address it and its \neffects?  \nFirst,  I would like to  see short -term interest rates move higher in response to improving \neconomic conditions  shortly after completion of the “taper.”  Many of the rules offering policy \nguidance on the federal funds rate —such as the “Taylor rule”  and its variants —are already or \nclose to prescribing a po licy rate higher than the current funds rate.  Second, the path toward the \nlonger -term neutral funds  should be gradual.  Given the lengthy period of unconventional policy \nand low rates, the necessary adjustment by financial markets to less central bank intervention and \n\n \n3 \n influence could be volatile.  In this environment, the pressure to quickly back away from a rising \nrate pol icy will be significant ; such pressures will need to be resisted. If not, we risk moving into \na confusing stop -and-go policy environment.  \nIn terms of the path after liftoff, the FOMC has signaled that it will take a gradual \napproach toward  the longer -run funds rate . For example,  the median of the latest FOMC \nSummary of Economic Projections  shows the economy reach ing full employment an d inflation \nat the 2 percent  target at the end of 2016. Such conditions, under more normal circumstances, \nwould imply the federal funds rate should be at, or at least near, its longer -run level.  However, \nthe federal funds rate is expected to be 2¼ percent by year -end 2016, compared to a median of 4 \npercent in the longer run. So, the funds rate could reach its lo nger-run level well after the \neconomic recovery is complete and inflation has returned to the 2 percent  goal.  \nThese signals suggest to banks  that they will  continue to contend with a low interest rate \nenvironment for a few years, even as economic conditions are lik ely to improve. I see this as a \nset of conditions ripe for greater risk -taking  as firms reach for yield and the imbalances related to \nsuch incentives  grow .  \nGradualism can promote financial stability, as it reduces the incidence of unexpe cted \nshifts in interest rates.  Even so, t he degree of inertia suggested in the median path of the federal \nfunds rate in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections goes beyond what is required to \nachieve  a smooth exit.  In my view,  it will likely be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate at a \nsomewhat faster pace than the median of committee members’ projections. Low rates into late \n2016 will likely continue to provide incentives for financial markets and investors to reach for \nyield in an economy operating at full capacity and risks achieving our objectives  over the longer \nrun. \n\n \n4 \n  \nA comprehensive approach to supervision  \n Given this landscape, how can bank supervisors respond? I will begin here by noting that  \nsubstantial effort s have been devoted to enhanced macroprudential supervision and requirements \naimed at strengthening bank balance sheets. Higher leverage ratios, liquidity requirements, stress \ntests and enhanced supervision of systemically important financial institutions  are designed to \ncontribute to a more stable financial system in the future.  However, our experience with these \ntools and the model -driven approaches when  evaluating the balance sheet s of large financial \ninstitution s is limited . For example, c ounter -cyclical capital buffers lack a type of “Taylor rule” \nthat would help guide us on when to make adjustments.  Absent a rule  for guidance , knowing the \nright time to adjust the buffers and by how much pose considerable challenges.   \n I would also note that a number of central banks did engage in a form of macroprudential \nsupervision before the crisis through their Financial Stability Reports.  Overall, these reports \nshow that potential risks were identified before the crisis, but it was far more dif ficult for central \nbanks to judge whether these risks would be fully realized and to then pursue corrective \nsupervisory action in an effective and timely manner.   \n Until we better understand how to utilize such tools, macroprudential supervision and the \nidentification of systemic risk can be most effective when it serves as a complement to a rigorous \nmicroprudential regime. Assessing risk-management policies and governance offer s a window \ninto the incentives that drive decision -making and risk appetite  at the level of an individual firm, \nproviding important context for macro views of the system.  \nEnhanced supervision over the past few years has focused more heavily on the role of \nquantitative models  rather than experienced bank examiners.  These contributions surely have \n\n \n5 \n been important complements to the supervisory regime.  But they are  not a substitute  for the \nperspectives of bank examiners . Macroprudential tools take a different approach to the \nsupervisory process than a commissioned bank examin er in two ways:  The credentialing  process \nfor examiners involves hands -on experience and assigns accountability to the findings of an \nexamination.  Early training includes classroom time in addition to work on bank analysis and \ntransaction testing.  Once an examiner is credentialed , that person can be the Examiner -in-Charge \n(EIC) . As the EIC, you sign the exam ination  report. And when you sign the examination report , \nyou are  accountable for the judgments and assessments contained in the report . \nI take a similar approach to monetary policy. Economic analysis from my staff provides a \nuseful high -level overview of economic trends and issue s relevant  to monetary policy. I feel \nmost confident when their analysis is consistent with anecdotes from my contacts , who are  \noperating businesses and making real -time hiring and pricing decisions. The macro view \ncomplements the micro information, and vice vers a. In the same way, this dynamic applies to \nfinancial supervision . \nThus, an effective supervisory framework blends the new quantitative macrosupervisory \napproaches with the qualitative judgments that supervisors  bring from examining individual \nfirms. So , as we experiment with macroprudential tools, we also must c ontinue t o devote \nresources to and emphasize microprudential supervision.  In addition, strengthening bank capital \nwith sturdier and higher leverage ratios is a n essential and prudent course of action. Recent \nchanges along these lines are encouraging. For example, I  see the enhanced supplementary \nleverage ratio as a positive step that avoids relying on risk -based capital standards, which can be \nexploited.  \n \n\n \n6 \n  \nConclusion  \nCertainly , the frameworks for central banking in the future are evolving and include all of \nthe topics being discussed during this conference.  They also will require a healthy dose of \nthinking —and humility —about the interaction between regulatory and interest rate p olicy if \nsustainable economic growth is to be achieved.  Interest rate policy needs to adjust to achieve \nprice stability and sustainable growth, both now and in the future. However, we have seen how \nasset bubbles can derail these goals . Finding the intersec tion of supervisory and interest rate \npolicy to achieve financial stability will be an important contribution to central banking in the \nnext century."

It was a reminder  that democracy  demands  accountability  from  \nits most  powerful  institutions  to its citizens.  The Federal  Reserve  is no exception.  \nIn my role as president  of a regional  Reserve  Bank, I am well aware  of the range  of views  \non the topic  of Federal  Reserve  accountability.  I’d like to share  with you some  comments  I read \nrecently.  For example,  one commentator  wrote  that even  if the central  bank’s “power  would  \nremain  in the hands  of the wisest,  the most  honorable,  and the most  disinterested”  leaders,  “it \nwould  not be possible  to satisfy  the people  throughout  the country  that the vast resources  and \npowers  of the bank  were  used only for the best interests  of all the people  and without  partiality  or \nfavor  to any section  of the country,  or to any class  or set of people....”1 When  it comes  to the \nnation’ s financial  matters,  someone  else noted  that authority  should  not be “concentrated  in one \ncity where  a small  clique  could  control  the system.”2  \n Yet another  comment  stated  that, “The business  resources  of the United  States...cannot  be \ncentralized . ...By  reason  of the great  expanse  of the country  and the diversity  of business  \nconditions  in the different  sections  of the country,  the details  of the business  of a central  bank  \ncould  not be managed  at a central  office.”3 Finally,  the desire  for local  control  was highlighted  in \nthis comment:  “No centralized  power  could  dominate  an organism  whose  life is drawn  from  \nfunctions  local to each community.”4  \n The sentiments  behind  these  words—concerns  about  power  and the conc entration  of \nfinancial  resources —ring true, but they are not in fact comments  on the recent  financial  crisis.  \nThis commentary  offers  a flavor  of the robust  and contentious  public  debate  that preceded  the \n                                                 \n1 Victor  Morawetz,  The Banking  and Currency  Problem  in the United  States . 1909  \n2 Robert  Owen.  The Federal  Reserve  Act. 1919.  \n3 “Doubts  Money  Plan.” The New York  Times . December  3, 1911.  \n4 Pamphlet  produced  by the Nationa l Citizens  League,  circa  1912 . \n\n2 \n signing  of the Federal  Reserve  Act in 1913.  It is striking  to me how familiar  those  words  are \ntoday.  It was this public sentiment  about  the country’ s economic  future  under  a central  bank  that \ninfluenced  Congress  to shape  the institution  in a way that would  garner  the trust and confidence  \nof the American  public. The result  was a decentralized  structure  that exists  today  with locations  \nacross  the country  operating  under  a rigorous  system  of checks  and balances.  \n  As a career  Federal  Reserve  employee,  bank  supervisor  and lifelong  Missourian,  I \nunderstand  the importance  of having  a central  bank  that is accountable  to the public.  In fact, as \nan official  with input  to national  policy  who lives  and works  in the center  of the United  States,  \nmy role is not happenstance , but rather  it is a deliberate  choice  on the part of the Federal  \nReserve’ s congressional  founders  that reflects  their intentions  for the structure  of the nation’s \ncentral  bank.  It is my view  that the Federal  Reserve’ s ability  to achieve  its broad  objectives  over \nthe past century  has been  possible  because  of its decentralized  structure.  The key role that the \nFederal  Reserve’ s structure  plays  in achieving  its mandates  is the focus  of my comments  today.  \n \nStructure  enhances  public  trust  \nThe Federal  Reserve  Act established  a framework  for the nation’s central  bank  that \ndeparted  materially  from  that of the First and Second  Banks  of the United  States.  Congress  \nrightly  understood  that the monolithic  structure  of these  first two centr al banks  was ill-suited  to \nrepresent  and serve  the diverse  interests,  geographies  and industries  that make  up the U.S. \neconomy.  The central  bank’s founders  understood  that the long-term success  and credibility  of \nthe institution  would  rely on its ability  to gain support  outside  the Washington -New  York  \ncorridor  of political  and financial  interests.   \n\n3 \n  To ensure  public  accountability,  the Federal  Reserve  Act called  for a government  \nagency—the Board  of Governors  in Washington,  D.C.—comp osed of individuals  who are \nnominated  by the president  and confirmed  by the Senate  to serve  14-year terms.  The Board  of \nGovernors  plays  an important  public  oversight  role for the entire  system,  without  which  a \nmeaningful  role for the quasi -governmental  regional  Reserve  Banks  would  not likely  be \nacceptable  to the public.  However,  to ensure  there  was appropriate  balance  and representation,  \nthe Act also called  for between  eight  and 12 Reserve  Banks  to be located  across the country.  A \ncommittee  of cabinet  members  took several  months  to arrive  at its decision  to name  the 12 \nFederal  Reserve  cities  that would  serve  as the regional  arms  of the nation’s central  bank.   \nOne hundred  years  ago this week,  on May 18, 1914,  a delegation  signed  paperwork  to \nincorporate  the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City.  Similar  meetings  were  held that spring  in \n11 other  cities,  and the Fede ral Reserve  System  began  operations  on Nov.  16, 1914.   \n Each  Reserve  Bank  is overseen  by a local  Board  of Directors  composed  of community  \nand business  leaders  from  diverse  sectors  across  each of the 12 regions.  These  directors  share  \ngovernance  responsibili ty for Reserve  Bank  operations  along  with the Board  of Governors.  \n In addition  to Reserve  Bank  boards,  individuals  serve  as directors  on the boards  at 24 \nFederal  Reserve  branch  offices.  All told, some  270 individuals  across  the country  serve  as \nFederal  Reserve directors,  providing  real-time economic  information  for the Federal  Reserve  to \nconsider  in its policy  formulation.  In addition,  through  their experiences  as leaders  in business,  \nand in the labor,  consumer,  banking  and agriculture  sectors , directors  offer an independent  \nperspective  on Reserve  Bank  operations,  budgetary  issues  and other  strategic  challenges.   \n  \n \n\n4 \n Structure  improves  operational  effectiveness  \n Over  the past century,  the Federal  Reserve’s local  connections  have  proven  to be valuable  \nin carrying  out its responsibilities.  Whether  responding  to a crisis,  delivering  financial  services,  \nor supervising  banks,  the deep  understanding  of regional  interests  has facilitated  effective  \noperational  performance.   \n Importantly,  the Reserve  Banks  are designed  to understand  credit  availability  issues  at the \nlocal  level.  You need  not go back  to 1913  to find an example  that underscores  this. As financial  \nmarkets  seized  up during  the most  recent  crisis,  the Board  of Governors  and the Federal  Reserve  \nBank  of New York  focused  their efforts  and resources  on designing  liquidity  facilities  to ease \nfinancial  conditions.  Even  as resources  were  dedicated  to pulling  Wall  Street  out of the depths  of \nthe financial  panic,  problems  developed  in other  parts  of the country  that needed  to be addressed,  \nincluding  in the Kansas  City Fed’s region.  \nAmong  the roles  served  by the regional  reserve  banks  is the statutory  responsibility  to act \nas a “lender  of last resort”  to depository  institutions  in the region.  Specifically,  the Fede ral \nReserve  is charged  with lending  against  collateral  to solvent  institutions,  making  its role as a \nbank  supervisor  complementary  to the ability  to confirm  eligibility  to borrow  on short  notice.  In \nthe case of the Kansas  City Fed, serving  as a lender  of last resort  across  its seven -state region  \nmeans  leveraging  relationships  and access  to information  on thousands  of institutions.  This \ninformation  is a particularly  critical  resource  during  crisis  situations.  During  the crisis  of 2008,  \nthe monthly  volume  of discount  window  borrowing  from  the Federal  Reserve  spiked  from  less \nthan $1 billion  pre-crisis  to a high of more  than $400  billion.5  \n                                                 \n5 See http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DISCBORR .  \n\n5 \n As funding  from  Wall  Street  dried  up in 2009,  the effects  rippled  across  the country.  In \nmy district,  a sizable  and health y financial  services  firm lost access  to its line of credit  from  a \nlarge  Wall  Street  bank.  While  this regional  institution  would  not be considered  systemically  \nimportant  by today’s regulatory  definition,  it certainly  played  an important  role in the economy  \nof its own Midwestern  community.  \nStaff at the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City worked  closely  with the Board  of \nGovernors ’ staff to consider  the firm’ s qualifications  to gain timely  access  to funding  and avoid  \nfailure.  The firm survived  the crisis  because the local  Reserve  Bank  was familiar  with the \ninstitution  and was able to connect  it with programs  that allowed  this otherwise  viable  firm to \ncontinue  its vital operations.  \nLikewise,  the regional  Reserve  Bank  is able to gauge  the local  effects  of financial  market  \nconditions  and economic  drivers  through  its role in supervising  banks.  Although  considerable  \nattention  is focused  today  on systemic  risk and systemically  important  financial  institutions,  the \nFederal  Reserve’s regional  connections  to more  than 6,000  community  banks  and 50 state \nbanking  departments  provide  essential  information  about  the economic  health  of small  business,  \nregional  economies,  credit  conditions  and the impact  of broader  regulatory  issues.   \nThrough  the Reserve  Banks’ presence  in their respective  communities,  regional  issues  \ncan be addressed  with the expertise  and knowledge  that a regional  Reserve  Bank  is equipped  to \nprovide.  Having  been  so recently  reminded  that access  to credit  is critical  to the economic  \nsuccess  for communitie s large  and small,  I think  it is quite  feasible  that if Congress  were  to \ndesign  the Federal  Reserve  System  today,  it might  well choose  to have  50 Reserve  Banks  rather  \nthan just 12. \n \n\n6 \n Structure  fosters  independent  thinking  \nThe system,  by design,  is intended  to include  a diverse  range  of perspectives,  and the \nReserve  Banks  contribute  importantly  to this diversity.  Many  have  criticized  this feature  by \nsuggesting  that the cacophony  of voices  sends  mixed  signals.  Yet, other  public  institutions  reflect  \nsimilar  democratic  processes  where  a mosaic  of perspectives  and input  is sometimes  messy.  \nEssential  to sound  outcomes  are leadership  and governing  processes  to bring  these  voices  \ntogether  for the purpose  of decision  making.  The same  is true for the Federal  Open  Marke t \nCommittee  (FOMC).  \n The FOMC  has a long-established  process  that provides  for discussion  and debate  of \npolicy  options.  But, the decision -making  process  is quite  clear:  12 participants —seven  from  the \nBoard  of Governors  and five from  the Reserve  Banks—cast votes  at each meeting  and the \nmajority  defines  the policy  action  with a statement  articulating  its rationale.  A $17 trillion  \neconomy  with complex  dynamics  is well-served  by this process,  which  includes  a range  of \nviewpoints  and inputs.  \n This structure  also, by design,  allows  for dissenting  views.  This feature  recognizes  the \nvalue  Americans  place  on independent  thinking.  Some  have  argued:  Why  not keep  differing  \nviews  internal  and present  a united  or consensus  view  to the public?  Woul dn’t solidarity  give \nmore  confidence  and clarity  to the public?  I believe  that masking  differing  policy  views  is \ninconsistent  with central  bank  communication  and transparency.  Making  differing  views  \navailable  to the public  serves  to clarify  issues.  It is the public  duty of each participant  of the \nFOMC  to express  their views.  To suggest  that FOMC  members  should  appear  to be unanimous  \nin voting  records  is to suggest  that diverse  perspectives  are not valued  and underestimates  the \npublic’s ability  to discern  intellectual  honesty.  \n\n7 \n Final ly, independent,  stable  and informed  leadership  is especially  important  to the \nFederal  Reserve’s policymaking  process.  Policy  decisions  have  broad  impact  and benefit  from  \nthe institution ’s research,  thoughtful  analysis and public  input.  Experience  and informed  \njudgment  are as important  to good  policy  as academic  and theoretical  frameworks.  \nThe Federal  Reserve  Act calls for members  of the Board  of Governors  to serve  14-year \nterms,  yet according  to one recent  report,  the average  tenure  of Federal  Reserve  gove rnors  since  \n1936  has been  7.3 years.  Since  1986,  the average  tenure  has fallen  to five years,  and the last 10 \ngovernors  to serve  have  held their seats  on average  for four years.6 Furthermore,  whether  \nmonetary  policy,  banking  regulation  or payments,  the public depends  on those  who serve  to \nbring  diversity  of experience  to the Federal  Reserve’s most  challenging  issues . This means  \nhonoring  the Federal  Reserve  Act’s requirement  for diversity  of background  and geography  \namong  the Governors.  Consistent  with this, I agree  that the Federal  Reserve  Board  would  be \nstrengthened  by having  someone  with community  banking  or community  bank  supervision  \nexperience  to fill one of its current  openings.   \n \nConclusion  \n The financial  crisis  is behind  us, thankfully,  but not far behind.  The image  in the rearview  \nmirror  is still large—and perhaps  closer—than it appears.  The Federal  Reserve’s history  is \nimportant , but it is only helpful  to the extent  that it positions  us to consider  how we might  \naddress  the considerable  challenges  that await  the central  bank  in the years  to come.  Those  \nchallenges  include  normalizing  monetary  policy,  effectively  supervising  the largest  financial  \ninstitutions,  and ensuring  a safe, efficient  and accessible  payments  system.   \n                                                 \n6 The New York  Times . “Tenures Becoming  Shor ter at a Short -Handed  Fed.” May 12, 2014.   \n\n8 \n Today's debate  is not about  second -guessing  those  who made  difficult  choices  in the \ninterest  of the country  during  the depths  of the financial  crisis.  However,  it is not enough  to \ndefend  the steps  taken  during  the crisis  by saying , “It could  have  been  worse.”  Instead,  the \nexperience  of the financial  crisis  should  lead policymakers  to the unequivocal  conviction  that \nthey will not rest until the foundations  of our financial  system  are shored  up to avoid  similar  \noutcomes  next time.  That is the pledge  policymakers  made  to the Ame rican  public. Through  the \nbroad -based  input  provided  by the decentralized  Federal  Reserve,  we can deliver  on this pledge.  \nThose  demonstrating  on Main  Street  in Kansas  City and other  parts  of the country  deserve  this. \nThe Federal  Reserve’s  centennial  provides  an oppo rtunity  to engage  the public  and to \nreflect  on the values  that have  allowed  the institution  to serve  the country.7 Its defining  \ncharacteristics,  if embraced,  can continue  to serve  as a source  of strength  for the nation  in the \nfuture.  As former  Senator  Robe rt Owen  noted  in an Octo ber 1913  speech  on the role of Reserve  \nBanks within  the Federal  Reserve  System,  “Their  function  must  be to protect  the commerce  of \nthe nation,  to stabilize  the interest  rate and to give permanency  to the prosperity  which  this \ncountr y ought  to enjoy  continuously.”   \nThat sentiment  is as true today  as it was 100 years  ago. \n                                                 \n7For more  on the Federal  Reserve’s centennial,  visit the System’s historical  gateway  at \nhttp://www.federalreservehistory.org/ ."

This meeting provides an excellent opportunity to \nhear what others are doing to strengthen their supervisory systems , including those here in \nAfrica . It also provides a n important venue for turning our attention to the long -run implications \nof polic ies and w hat we can do to create a more -resilient financial system.   \nFinancial supervisors and regulators are clearly facing unique challenges in the aftermath \nof the financial crisis.  In the Unite d States , financial institutions are stronger , although they still \nhave not recovered fully from the problems they experienced during the crisis. Demand for credit \nhas been relatively anemic during the domestic and global econom ic recover y, hindering efforts \nby these institutions to restore their lending busine ss and other activities to more -normal levels.  \nAs supervisors, we face the additional challenge of implementing the many new laws and \nreforms that our countries have instituted in response to the  crisis and to enhance  financial \nstability.   \nThere is another challenge  that threatens to undermine our best supervisory efforts and \ncould set the stage for instability  if it is not addressed appropriately and in a timely manner . This \nchallenge comes from the continued reliance on highly accommodative and unconventional \nmonetary policies and the incentives such policies provide to pursue riskier banking and \ninvestment strategies.  These policies have the effect of dampening the profitability of traditional \nbanking activities, thus encouraging ban kers and other market participants to look for greater \nreturns in other, riskier  areas . \nToday, I will focus my remarks on  the risks that current U.S. monetary policy poses to \nfinancial stability  and the challenges it  creates for supervisors . Then I will explore what steps \nsupervisors  might take to address these threats.  \n \n\n2 \n Current Monetary Policy and the Financial Implications  \nIn response to the financi al crisis, the Federal Reserve and other central banking \nauthorities significantly lowered their policy rates during the financial crisis and have continued \nto hold these rates near zero. In some countries, these highly accommodative monetary policies \nhave been supplemented by quantitat ive easing programs, expanded  central bank lending \nauthority  and forward guidance statements committing central banks to hold rates low well into \nthe future.  \nIn the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee has held the federal funds rate \nin a 0 to ¼ percent range since December 2008. Furthermore, the Committee’s forward guidance  \nstates that it anticipate s maintaining these rates “well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndrops below 6 1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to r un below the \nCommittee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”    \nTo provide additional monetary stimulus, the Federal Reserve has also implemented three \nquantitative easing programs, involving extensive  purchases of long -term U. S. Treasury \nsecurities and mortgage -backed securities issued by go vernment sponsored enterprises.  These \nefforts began in late 2008. Since September 2012, the Fed has been buying $40 billion in \nmortgage -backed securities every month and about $45 billion in long -term Treasuries —a policy \nthat the FOMC announced last month would be tapered back by $5 billion less in each category \nper month. This week the FOMC committed to another $5 billion reduction in each of these \ncategories. As shown in Chart 1, t hese quantitative easing programs have led to substantial  \nexpan sion in  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet —from around $800 billion in late 2008 to more \nthan $4 trillion currently —and much of its traditional asset holdings have been replaced with \nlonger-term Treasury and mortgage -backed securities . \n\n3 \n The FOMC continue s to support  current levels of monetary accommodation as desirable \nand necessary as long as the growth in GDP and employment is slow and inflation remains low.  \nAlthough the benefits of the current policy settings are presumed to outweigh potential costs, this \ntradeoff is not well understood . Accordingly , I remai n concerned that continuation of these \npolicies could have significant long -term costs.  \nThe costs of accommodative policies , moreover, may not be confined to just the countri es \nwith expansive policies. Such  policies can influence other countries by distorting their exchange \nrates and balance of payment positions, capital flows and rates of credit expansion.  \nAs a former bank supervisor, I also am concerned about the effects of  current monetary \naccommodation on the banking industry and financial stability. Simply put, hold ing the price of \ncredit at near zero rates for years can negatively impact  institutions whose primary business is \nmaking loans. As central banks undertake unprecedented actions to alter rates and prices in \nfinancial markets , we should not be surprised to find unintended , negative  side effects.  \nZero interest rate and quantitative easing policies clearly limit the returns that bankers \ncan achieve in their traditional lending and investment activ ities, thus affecting the profitability \nof what we would view as essential banking activities. Beyond this, the forward guidance of \ncentral banks provides little assurance to bankers that this lending environment will improve —an \noutcome that is further com pounded by modest economic growth and a more -limited pool of \ncreditworthy borrowers for banks.  \nIn addition, bankers face a great deal of uncertainty. Monetary policy has taken us far \nfrom a normal financial environment, and the influence that accommodative policy and \nquantitative easing will ultimately have on longer -term rates and inflation expectations is \nunclear. Similar ly, some bankers are uncertain about how much of the surge in deposits produced \n\n4 \n by accommodative monetary policies can be retained by their banks  once interest rates and the \ncompetition for funds increase  (See Chart 2) .      \nAs supervisors, we can conclude  that this uncertainty and reduced p rofitability in \ntraditional banking activities can provide a nearly irresistible incentive to expand into \nnontraditional and higher -risk activities. Bankers are also likely to  “chase yields” by increasing \ntheir credit an d interest rate exposures and by increasing their own leverage.  There are signs that \nsuggest we are already on this path —a path that is likely  to become even more popular and \nenticing as financial competition increase s and memories from the fears and threa ts of the \nfinancial crisis  continue to fade . \nBank net interest margins are already near historic lows  as loan rates remain compressed \nand traditional banking activities no longer generate the profits they once did  (See Chart 3) . As a \nresult, low interest rate policies may have the adverse effect of impeding  traditional bank lending  \nchannels  and reducing the availability of funds for business expansion . It should be no surprise \nthat bankers supply less credit when the returns are so low —an outcome that keep s the economy \nwell below its potential and , hence,  more vulnerable to possible shocks.   \nSeveral measures point to the banking industry taking on added risk in an attempt to \nrestore profitability. While overall lending growth has been slow, the gr eatest growth appears to \nbe taking place in higher -risk categories, including oil and gas lending and leveraged lending  \n(See Chart 4) . Much of the recent growth in leveraged lending, moreover, is characterized by \nweaker underwriting standards, including hi gher debt ratios and fewer covenant protections.  This \ndeterioration in credit standards may not yet be a serious concern, but it is reasonable to assume \nthat lenders will be even more aggressive in  relax ing their terms as they seek more business  and \nattemp t to counter a prolonged low rate environment . \n\n5 \n In addition, m ore interest rate risk may be building up in the banking industry as bankers \nrespond to incentives  to move out along the yield curve to generate earnings. In this regard, there \nare signs that a rising number of banks are increasing their holdings of longer -term securities and \nloans —all at a time when long -term rates may rise as economic growth strength ens (See Chart \n5).     \nA final outcome of unconventional monetary policy and the incentives created by low \nrates could be a repeat of some of the liquidity and asset bubble problems experienced during \nthis crisis. For instance, “borrow short and lend long”  strategies are likely to be an outgrowth of \nthe current environment and could eventually lead to another round of liquidity problems. Also, \nwhile it is hard to identify asset bubbles with much certainty or timeliness , we have already seen \nrapid increases in farmland prices and stock prices in the United States  (See Chart 6) .  \n \nWhat Can Supervisors Do?  \nEven as we see improvements in our financial markets, the se concerns suggest \nsupervisors still face key challenges and must  give serious thought to how such challenges  might \nbe addressed . Relative to the highly accommodative and unconventional mone tary policy \nsettings in the United States , initial steps have been taken to slow the pace of asset purchases. I \nview this as a modest but positive step, allowing financial markets to better price risk and \nallocate credit  and to provide the proper incentives for conducting traditional banking services. \nHowever, until policy normalizes , supervisors must deal with whatever risks might arise.   \nSome would argue  that rece nt financial reforms have left supervisors with a better set of \ntools to address  the type of liquidity, capital  and asset bubble problems recently encountered.   \nConsiderable effort has been made to create  a new system of macroprudential supervision, \n\n6 \n countercyclical capital standards, liquidity requirements, stress tests  and enhanced supervision of \nsystemically important institutions. These approaches require careful quantification and \nmeasurements of risk, massive data se ts, forward -looking assessment s and more model -driven \napproaches. As we gain further experience with these tools, they may indeed provide additional \ninsights into financial markets and their vulnerabilities.  \nIn implementing this new framework, though, there are a number of inherent pro blems  \nand challenges . When is the right time to impose countercyclical capital buffers? Will policy and \ninformation lags and the time that must be given for institutions to raise capital mean that  such \nactions will be delayed until they are no longer usefu l or are even counterproductive? A similar \nset of concerns surround s stress testing. What are the right scenarios , and are all key risks \nincorporated into the tests?  \nWe should also note that a number of central banks did engage in a form of \nmacroprudential  supervision before the crisis through their Financial Stability Reports. Overall, \nthese reports show  that potential risks were  identified  before the crisis , but it was far  more \ndifficult for central banks to judge whether these risks w ould be fully realiz ed and to then pursue  \ncorrective supervisory action in an effective and timely manner.  Consequently, while we \ncontinue to experiment with macroprudential supervision,  we must place primary emphasis on a \nmore traditional set of supervisory responses.  \nWhat steps should we be taking now in our role as supervisors? First, given that it will be \ndifficult to identify and quickly respond to the risks emerging under current monetary policies, I \nwould argue for continuing to strengthen bank capital through hig her leverage ratios. Our \nexperience in the recent financial crisis provides strong evidence that risk -based capital standards \nmay fail to capture actual risk levels and can further be exploited by bankers.  \n\n7 \n As shown in Chart 7, the ratio of risk -weighted as sets to total assets among large U .S. \nbanking organizations  steadily declined before the crisis . While this chart might imply that these \norganizations were shifting toward safer assets , the resulting losses from the crisis certainly did \nnot correspond to lower levels  of risk on their balance sheets . \nGiven the apparent shortcomings in risk -based capital standards,  stronger leverage ratios \nare the simplest and most direct way to ensure adequate capital in banks . Consequently , as \nquickly as possible, we should move toward higher leverage ratios and set these ratios at levels \nthat will provide enough  capital in a  broad range of adverse economic scenarios . \nSecond, we should take a careful look at what we allow banks to do . In parti cular, we \nshould think about  how we can encourage traditional activities and the risks that are most \nconsistent with public safety nets . One approach  we are taking  in the United States is to restrict \nthe pr oprietary trading activities of bank ing organizati ons through the Volcker Rule. These \nrestrictions have not been easy to design, but they offer a way to limit the incentives for certain \nriskier activities that may seem attractive , especially now,  to improve profitability . \nA final point on strengthening su pervision is that we must continue to emphasize \nmicroprudential supervision and the important role that bank examiners play. It seems  clear that \nmany factors behind the recent financial crisis might have been detected through traditional \nexamination and supervisory processes if properly supported and performed correctly.  \nFor example , lax lending standards, risky fund ing strategies, poor governance and overly \noptimistic risk -management strategies all played key  roles in the crisis. Each of these is a factor \nthat experienced examiners have the best chance of identifying at an early, remedial stage  and \nthen pursuing corrective action and improved  bank risk -management practices . In contrast, these  \nrisks and wea knesses may be difficult to estimate  until much later and are thus likely to  escape \n\n8 \n timely detection if we rely primarily on purely quantitative approaches and other elements of \nmacroprudential supervision.  \nTo the extent similar weaknesses emerge  as an out grow th of current monetary polic ies \nand risk appetites , strong examination processes are a critical element in flagging such risks  at \nthe firm level.  However, limiting the conditions or incentives for risk -taking and their broader \neffect s on financial stability  must be recognized as beyond the scope of supervision  \n \nConcluding Comments  \n Supervisors face a number of challenges associated with implementing new rules and \nreforms, but they must also remain attentive to the incentives for risk -taking in an unusually low \nand prolon ged interest rate environment. The incentives to reach for yield and boost profitability \npose particular challenges for supervisors and could introduce undesirable and destabilizing \nconditions.   \nAlthough recent financia l reforms have given  supervisors a broad  range of new tools, \nconsiderable value remains to affect supervisory outcomes through  the microprudential tools we \nalready have. Key steps we can and should take include imposing stronger leverage \nrequirements , focus ing banking activities on traditional c redit intermediation functions , and \nusing experienced and skilled examiners to apply informed judgments in the identif ication of \nemerging risks and unsound banking strategies.  \n         \n \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5\nTraditional Security Holdings Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchases\nLong Term Treasury Purchases Lending to Financial Institutions and Credit MarketsRapid Expansion in the Federal Reserve \nBalance Sheet  \nBear Stearns Failure  QE1 QE2 $ Trillions  \nSource:  Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland – Credit Easing Policy Tool  QE3 Chart 1  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \nBank Deposits Have Surged Since the Crisis * \n7.30  \n0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.08.0$ Trillions  \n* Excludes Time Deposits  \nSource:  Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 2  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n3.20%  \n3.0%3.2%3.4%3.6%3.8%4.0%4.2%4.4%% of Average Earning Assets  Bank Net Interest Margins Have Declined  \nNotes: Net interest margin is measured as interest income net of interest expense (YTD), as a percentage of average earning a ssets - annualized.   \nSource: Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 3  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \nLeveraged Loan Issuance Surpasses  \n2007 Peak  \nSource:  S&P Capital IQ/LCD  Chart 4  \nPro Rata  \nInstitutional  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n2005  \n2005  2006  \n2006  2007  \n2007  2008  \n2008  2009  \n2009  2010  \n2010  2011  \n2011  2012  \n2012  Sep-13 \nSep-13 \n0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%\nUnder 3 Years Over 3 YearsIncreased Holdings of Longer -Term \nSecurities & Loans  \n(Commercial Banks Under $50 Billion)  \nSource:  Reports of Condition and Income  % of Total Securities & Loans  \n48%  63%  \n52%  \n37%  Chart 5  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n18.7%  \n-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Annual Percentage Increase in Midwest \nFarmland Values  \n% Change From Previous Year  \n* Non -irrigated Farmland  \nSource: Kansas City Federal Reserve’s quarterly Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions  Chart 6  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n59.5%  \n50%55%60%65%70%75%80%Risk-Weighted Assets at the Ten Largest \nU.S. BHCs  \nNotes: Depending on the year, the chart excludes MetLife and foreign BHCs.  \nSource: Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 7  \n% of Total Assets"

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWisconsin Bankers Association  \nEconomic Forecast Luncheon  \nMadison, Wis . \nJanuary 9, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n \n1 \n It is a pleasure to be here today  to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy, the stance of \nmonetary policy, and key issues facing community bank s. The focus on community banking is \nnot because the Wisconsin Bankers Association invited me here, but because c ommunity banks \nplay a vital role i n supporting economic activity in their local communities .  \n \nEconomic Outlook  \nThe U .S. economy has been recovering steadily over the past few years while facing \nvarious obstacles ranging from fiscal policy issue s to weak global growth.  As we start a new \nyear, t he economic outlook is brighter  with r eal gross domestic  product ( GDP ) show ing steady \ngrowth  over each of the last three quarters. Some of the improvement has been driven by \ntemporary factors, such as inventory accumulation , but if we look past such  transitory issues , the \ndata suggest the growth outlook for 2014 may be among the strongest since the end of the \nrecession.    \nOne simple reason growth should improve is because the initial impact of last year’s \nfiscal policy stance  has eased . The cumulative effect of the  mandated spending cuts and higher \ntaxes, by some estimates , was to lower overall real GDP growth by about 1.5 percentage points . \nGranted, there  will likely be further adjustments  to fiscal policy  to ensure long -term stability , but \nwith the effects from 2013 fading and the recent budget agreement red ucing some  policy \nuncertainty , the growth outlook is more positive .  \nBeyond these fiscal issues , however, and m ore important ly because consumer spending \naccounts for more than two -thirds o f the economy , is the fundamental strengthening in private \ndemand . Better labor market s, stronger household balance sheets,  and income  growth  have \nfostered this improvement . Real disposable income growth and average hourly earnings in the \n\n \n \n2 \n private sector have been trending higher . Employment  growth , too, has been gaining strength , as \nnearly every major sector has higher employment compared to a year ago. In fact, g overnment is \nthe only major sector to have shed jobs over the past year, but even that trend has shown signs of \nreversing. Combined, net job creation is close to  its fastest pace since the end of the crisis.  \nBusinesses also are well -position ed to begin increasing investment in new capital. \nCorporate profits are at record highs , balance sheets are healthy and many firms have the \nresources to make new capital expen ditures and expand capacity. That said, m any businesses  \nhave remained cautious the past few years due to a number of uncertainties that include the \nstrength of the global and U.S. recovery, the impact of regulations and new laws, and concerns \nover the direction of both fiscal and monetary policy. To the extent these uncertainties fade and \nglobal growth strengthens, as it could if Europe continues to recover, business investment is \npoised for growth . \nAccordingly, a bsent an unexpected s hock or a downturn  in global growth  this year , I \nexpect U.S. growth for 2014 to be in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, reflecting the \ncombination of less fiscal drag, hea lthier household balance sheets  and improving labor \nmarkets —one of the better years in some  time.   \nEven as growth projections strengthen , inflation measures remain low . In fact, s ome have \nquestioned whether inflation is too low given the Fed’s inflation target of 2  percent  or whether \nthe United States  could face the risk of deflatio n. I do not share those concerns  because s everal \nspecial factors appear to be weighing on inflation  measures , such as lower -than-usual health care \ncosts, changes in how the price of some financial services are calculated , and low import prices . \nAdditionally , longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable near the 2  percent  goal.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n  \nMonetary Policy  \nSince 2008, the Federal Reserve has maintained an extraordinary level of monetary \naccommodation to support the economy.  With short -term interest rates nea r zero, the Federal \nOpen Market Committee ( FOMC ) has also used unconventional policy tools such as large -scale \nasset purchases (known as quantitative easing or QE ) to lower longer -term rates and boost asset \nprices.   \nLast month, the FOMC  took its first step  in reducing the pace of asset purch ases referred \nto as QE3 . With the improving outlook and confidence that the gains in the labor market will be \nsustained, the Committee decided in December  to slow the pace of purchases from $85 billion \nper month to $75 b illion —a decision I supported . Although this is a modest step, it is an \nimportant part of the process of moving toward  a more -normal interest rate environment , which I \nview not only as essential but also as a positive development for the economy  and the banking \nindustry . Even so, monetary policy is likely to remain highly accommodative for some time with \nadditional (albeit reduced) asset purchases under the current program and an extended period of \nlow interest rates.  I remain concerned about the  potential costs and consequences of these \nuntested policies.  \n \nSecuring An Effective Regulatory Framework  \nAs the U .S. economy continues its path to full recovery, a vibrant and diverse system of \nbanks with sustainable, long -term prospects is critical to support the health of local and regional \neconomies, and therefore, the national economy. Let me turn now to how the industry is \npositioned to carry out that important  function .  \n\n \n \n4 \n Overall, the health of community banks is good, although it  has not fully recovered to \npre-crisis levels.  Net earnings have been relatively flat since 2012 , but they are at a respectable \nlevel of about  1 percent of assets.  Problem assets are trending down, and  although they are still \nsomewhat elevated, I expect the trend to continue.  Capital ratios also continue  to strengthen . \nWhat concerns me, though, is that the quality of net earnings is not strong. Earnings have \nbeen largely supported by d eclining provisions and reserve releases, which we  know cannot \ncontinue much longer.  At the same time , we’ve seen that the net interest margin, which is the \nprimary source of revenue  for community banks, has lost much of its post -recession  gain and is \nnear a 40 -year low  due to the  low interest rates  and weak loan demand.   \nWith this extreme pressure on net interest margins, b anke rs have expressed concern about \nlower  underwriting standards, l onger  maturities at fixed rates  and increased co mpetition from \nlarger banks that are likely to pull out of  local  markets when the economy improves further.  \nBank supervisors are monitoring these risks for vulnerabilities that will lead to asset quality \nproblems when interest rates start to rise or if there is a downturn in the economy.  Even so, an \nextended period of zero interest rates is not conducive to good banking and encourage s a reach \nfor yield .  \nThe effects of this unfavorable interest rate environment are compounded by the \nregulatory framework.  After two decades of deregulation and misplaced confidence in the ability \nof market discipline to moderate risk exposures , the pendulum has swung in favor of new, \ncomplex regulation.  Congress re sponded to the financial panic and the resulting deep recessio n \nby passing the Dodd -Frank Act, aimed at reducing the systemic risks posed to our economy by \nfirms  that we commonly refer to  as too  big to fail ( TBTF ). It remains unclear whether the new \nregulatory regime will in fact end TBTF and thereby reduce the syste mic risk posed by the \n\n \n \n5 \n largest banks  and the subsidy they enjoy . My own view is that incentives have not changed in a \nway that would achieve the desired outcome of a safer , more competitive financial system.   \nWhat is clear is that while much effort has been directed to implementing the Dodd -Frank \nAct, the competitive and regulatory pressures on the community bank model ha ve only \nworsened . Over the past 30 years, the distribution of banking assets across community, regional \nand large  global banks has moved steadily toward more concentration.  Industry concentration \nhas accelerated over the past 15 years with the 10 largest banking firms increasing their share of \nindustry assets from 44 percent in 1997 to 68 percent in 201 3. Even more s triking, their size has \nalmost tripled as a share of GDP, rising from 24 percent to 68 percent.  With this growing scale, \nthe scope of their activities exp anded as well.  In 1997, these large banking organizations held \nnearly 90 percent of their assets in traditional banking activities . In 2013, traditional banking \naccount ed for just 67 percent  of assets . And the five largest banks designated as posing a \nsystemic risk hold far less equity as a percent of total assets than community banks.  In fact, \nWisconsin  banks alone have capital ratios that are 35 percent higher than these five largest \nbanks.    \nCommunity banks have lost market share to these large players  with a share of industry \nassets half as large as 15 years ago, falling from 35  percent to 17  percent.  Yet, they have \ngenerally retained a business model that we assoc iate with traditional banking: making loans and \ntaking deposits in their local communities. In fact, community banks make more than half of all \nsmall business loa ns and extend credit in thous ands of locales across the country , including rural \nareas . Return on equity may be the bottom line in financial reports, but the foundation for the \ncommunity bank is c ustomer relationships and community economic health.   \n\n \n \n6 \n So as we look toward an improving outlook for 2014, the viability of community banking \nin the current regulatory and monetary policy environment is a relevant consideration  given their \nimportant role in meet ing local credit needs . \nAs a former community ban k examiner, I understand how the increase in regulations and \nrules  translates into higher operating costs and can influence decisions about whether to continue \ncertain business lines.  And, i ronically, this increased regulatory burden and low rate  \nenvironment —all undertaken with good intentions t o address the crisis —are disproportionately \naffecting community banks and accelerating the pace of consolidation trends . \nTo address the regulatory burden  on community banks , a rising chorus is calling for a \ntwo-tiered regulatory system  to better calibrate regulations according to the business model and \nsize of banks.  While  I am sympathetic to the idea of this kind of differentiation  and the desired \nrelief it hopes to offer , I do not think it is the answer.  As we have seen with certain provisions of \nthe Dodd -Frank Act, c alibrating regulations across broad groupings of banks is very difficult and \nthe outcomes  are not always as intended . And  fundamentally , it does not address a more \nthreatening issue to the viability of community banks and the perseverance of a diverse banking \nsystem . That issue is TBTF . We must pursue the essential reform needed to eliminat e TBTF , \nwhich is the cause of the increasingly complex regulatory system confronting community bank s \nand stands in the way of secur ing a financial system that serves —not threatens —the economic \nwell-being of the country.   \nI realize that ending TBTF is not necessarily viewed as a community bank’s biggest \nissue.  In my own region, community bankers will readily acknowledge that TBTF is a serious \nproblem , but their focus understandably is on the competitor across the street which is generally \na government sponsored enterprise , a credit union or another community or regional bank . \n\n \n \n7 \n Others are reluctant to ca ll for reform of these large st banks because they view all banks as part \nof the same industry  and advocate such . Still o thers have become resigned to TBTF as a \npermanent fixture of the global financial system  that cannot be changed  and therefore hinge the \ncommunity bank’s survival prospects on tiered regulation as the most  practical answer to the \nregulatory burden.   \nIn many respects, p olicymakers have already moved toward a bifurcated regulatory \nsystem by resorting to massive and complex rules for TBTF bank s in hopes of smothering their \nsystemic risk.  These rules may temporarily handicap TBTF risks, but I do not believe these \npolicies can solve the problem.  Research suggests that regulatory complexity incentivizes the \nregulated to game the rules (Kane) , while other research finds that simple rules are harder to \nmanipulate and more durable (Haldane).1  \nConsider capital requirements as an example.  Banks with more than $50 billion in assets \nare subject to higher minimum risk -based capital standards than sma ller banks so that they have \na larger cushion of capital given the systemic risk they pose to the economy. Yet when you look \nat the actual amount of capital that they hold relative to their total assets, their capital ratios are \nlower. For example,  the Tie r 1 leverage ratio of the 10 largest bank holding companies is 8 \npercent , which  is significantly lower than the 10.3 percent held by community banks, and even \nlower relative to the 11.2 percent held by Wisconsin community banks.     \nBecause community banks and TBTF banks are inextricably linked by public safety nets, \nI believe it is in the long -term interest of community banks and the health of our economy to rely \n                                                           \n1 Edward Kane, “ Good Intentions and Unintended Evil: The Case Against Selective Credit Allocation ,” Journal of \nMoney, Credit, and Banking, February 1977.

Our existing regulatory framework res ts on sound principles —\na safe, stable  and competitive banking system; equal access to services;  consumer  protection ; and \nthe preventi on of  illegal activities.  To implement these principles, we need rules for banks of all \nsizes that are understandable, enforceable  and equitable.  We also need a supervisory process \nwith appropriate flexibility so examiners can apply experienced judgment and thereby \ndifferentiate the supervisory regime based on the risk profile and business practices of individual \ninstituti ons.  \nIn addition, p olicymakers should consider alternatives that could foster both a safer \nsystem and a simpler regulatory framework.  Such alternatives include strengthening the \nseparati on of  banking and commerce or adopting a modern version of G lass-Steagall.2 \nUnfortunately, these ideas  have been sidetracked as too blunt or overly simplistic.  Such \nreforms would change incentives to take excessive risk and would simplify the largest banking \norganizations , provid ing a stronger foundation for management and boards of directors to govern \ncompliance and risk management . For supervisors , it would improve their ability  to enforce  rules  \nand facilitate orderly resolutions if a large bank fails . Until TBTF and its subsidized advantages \nare adequately addressed, econ omic security remains at risk , and community banks might well \nexpect to lose market share  while continuing to deal with the issue of how future regulatory \nchanges can appropriately be applied to them.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n2 For a proposal for a modern version of Glass -Steagall, see Thomas M.

The \nbanking industry  is stronger and better able  to serv e the nation’s credit needs.  Community banks \nin particular face challenges in serving  the credit needs of their customers and their communities  \ndue to impediments from ill-suited regulatory policies . In the near -term, timely s hifts in \nmonetary policy a nd better calibration of regulatory requirements  may offer potential relief to \nsmaller banks . Ultimately, though, ending TBTF and its related advantages wi ll serve to enhance \nthe viability of community banks  and restore public confidence.  I am hopeful that policymakers \nwill continue to vigorously pursue this important objective."

Forums  such  as this one provide  a valuable \nopportunity  to hear  a wide  range  of perspectives  from  policymakers  and others  on key  challenges  \nfacing  us today . I also want  to thank Deputy  Governor  Anne  Le Lorier , who joined us  in Jackson  \nHole,  Wyoming, this  summer  for our  program  on the global  effects  of unconventional  monetary  \npolicy .  \nConsiderable  attention  has been  focused  on fix ing the problems  that caused  tremendous  \ndamage  to the global  financial  system  and economy.  More  than  five years  later,  we are still \nfeeling  the effects  of the financial  crisis,  and, at least  in the United  States , questions  remain  as to \nwhether  we are taking  the right  steps.  Certainly , the stakes  are high  and, therefore,  many  \npolicymakers  around the  world  have  committed  themselves  to improving  the durability  and \nresiliency  of the financial  system.  \nLike you, the  United  States  is committed  to finding  a way forward  and doing  so in a \nmanner  that serves  both domestic  and global  objectives. American  policymakers  and regulators  \nare working  intently  to finalize  and to implement  numerous  regulatory  changes.  Of course,  it will \nbe some  time  before  the full effects  of these changes —both intended and  unintended—are \nunderstood.  \nAs we focus  on new  tools  and approaches  to supervision and  regulation  and bolster  our \nability  to assess risks  to financial  stability,  my own view  is that macroprudential  supervision and  \nthe identification  of systemic  risk can be most  effective when  it serves  as a complement  to a \nrigorous  microprudential  regime.  It is at the firm  level where the  validation  of risk-management  \npolicies  and governance can offer  a window  into the incentives  that drive  decision -making  and \n\n2 risk appetite.  This  foundation can  provide  important  context  and confidence  in our \nmacroprudential  views  of the system.  Assuring  that we allocate scarce  resources  and serve the  \npublic ’s interest,  we must  balance today’s  regulatory  innovation with  existing  prudential  \nstandards . In my remarks  today , I will address  three  aspects  of a supervisory  framework  that \nbring  such  balance and  enhanc e both firm -level  supervision and  system -wide  assessments:  \ninformed  judgments  by examiners , supervisory  transparency  and regulatory  cooperation.  \n \nThe role of  examiner  judgment  in the new  supervisory  framework   \nMuch  of our efforts  to reform  the supervisory  framework  in the United  States  have  \ncentered  on such  features  as macr oprudential  supervision, stress- testing,  enhanced  prudential  \nstandards  of supervision for systemically  important  financial  institutions,  and orderly  liquidation  \nauthority. T hese features  place new  demands  on the  central  bank and  other  regulatory  bodies  to \napply  more  rigor  in how  we supervise  certain  financial  institutions  as well  as to create a  more  \ncomprehensive  understanding  of systemic  risk. Quantifying  and measuring  risk has become core \nto this task.  In addition, the  international  capital  framework  continues  to rely heavily  on very  \ndetailed  formulations  and risk models, and  the scenarios  that many  countries  will use to test the \ncapital  adequacy  of major  banks  will require  access  to massive  data sets  to make the  necessary  \ncalculations.  \nThese developments  suggest  a different  supervisory  regime  than  what  we have used  in \nthe past.  The trend  toward  a more  highly  quantitative  and model -driven approach  to risk \nmeasurement  and capital  adequacy  offers  a more  forward -looking  assessment  of financial  \ninstitutions  and the impact of  macro  risks  to the economy. No  doubt , as we gain  experience with  \n\n3 such tools, they  will be  further  refined  to bring  additional  insights  to vulnerabilities  in the \nfinancial  system.  \nNotwit hstanding  the potential  of these new  approaches, our  enthusiasm  to become \nmacroprudent ial supervisors  should be  tempered  with a healthy  recognition  that these methods  \nare not  a substitute  for micro prudential  supervision. I believe we  must  be careful  to appreciate \nthe crucial  role that informed judgments  by experienced  examiners  can continue  to play  in the \nsupervision of  financial  firms.  Many  of the key contributors  to this crisis —lax lending  standards, \nrisky  funding  strategies , poor governance and overly  optimistic  risk management  strategies —are  \nshortcomings  that can best be detected  through traditional examination  and supervisory  \nprocesses  when  properly  supported by  the supervisory  framework . \nIt is too easily  assumed  that financial  models, str ess tests  and macroprudential  \nsupervision will provide  “smarter” supervision and  identify  what  is presumed  to have  been  \nmissed  by examiners  in the run-up to  the 2008 financial  crisis.  However,  a more  thorough \nanalysis  suggest s that the largest  banks  were more  vulnerable  because regulators  relied  too \nheavily  on erroneous  assumptions  about  the quality  of governance and controls  over  incentives,  \nsophistication  and measurement  of risk management , and  the strength  of market  discipline . As a \nresult , regulators  had already  given  up on the  type  of full-scope  examinations  that smaller  \ninstitutions  typically  experience.  Prior to  2008, most  of the supervisory  emphasis  centered  on a  \nlarge institution’s  models  and risk weights , and  far less effort  was given  to a thorough \nexamination  and critical  analysis  of its loan  portfolio, funding  strategies  and exposure  to exotic  \nrisks  such  as synthetic  derivatives.  \nThe Dodd- Frank  Act requires  enhanced  prudential  standards  for firms  in the United  \nStates  that pose  elevated  risk to financial  stability . These macroprudential  efforts  are worthy  \n\n4 exercises , but no matter  the tool, experience and  informed  judgments  provided by  trained  and \nexperienced  staff  are required  to meet  today’s  heightened  supervisory  expectations.  Data and  \nmodels  provide  information and  choices  that must  be evaluated  in the context  of the more  \nsubjective  or qualitative  elements  of the organization, such  as the quality  of internal  controls  and \nprotocols, management  and organizational  culture.   \nWe must  be mindful  that macroprudential  supervision is  not yet a proven tool  in the work  \nof financial  supervision. Prior to  the crisis,  a number  of central  banks  conducted  their  own  \nversions  of macropr udential  supervision and  stress -testing  of major  institutions  using  their \nFinancial  Stability  Reports  and the detailed  analysis  behind these reports . While  these reports  \nidentified  potential  risks,  they  were not  able to  provide  a clear,  advance warning  of the crisis  or a \ntimely  signal  to financial  supervisors  and monetary  authorities  to take corrective action.   \nA successful  supervisory  framework  thus  will require  a blending  of new  quantitative  \nmacrosupervisory  approaches  with  the qualitative  judgments  that examiners  can contribute  at the \nfirm level.  As we adopt  new  and yet untried programs,  we should not  draw  resources  away  from  \nmicroprudential  supervision. We  must  assimilate  these approa ches and not confuse  their  roles. \nAsking  plumbers  to do the  work  of electricians  risks  burning  something  down. On  the other  \nhand, allowing  plumbers  and electricians  to work  together  is likely  to deliver  reliable  \nfunctionality.  \n \nEnhancing  market discipline  with  transparency  in supervision  \nA second  point  I would like  to explore  is how  we might use  supervision to  increase \ntransparency  in financial  markets  and thereby  restore something  that was missing  in this crisis —\nan effective framework  of market  discipline  and a set of incentives  for the  financial  industry  that \n\n5 does not encourage  excessive risk -taking  again.  Central banks  have  for some  time  regarded  \ntransparency  as essential  to accountability  and the effective transmission  of monetary  policy. \nWhile  there are some  aspects  of supervision that  may be best left confidential,  there are other  \nareas  where we  should thin k about  how  we can make our  goals  and actions  more  systematic,  \npredictable and transparent.  \nWe have  taken  several  steps  in this direction  in the United  States.  At the Federal  Reserve,  \nwe disclose  the capital  stress- testing  methodology  and the results  from  our Comprehensive  \nCapital  Analysis  and Review  (CCAR)  program.  These CCAR disclosures  are a work  in progress,  \nand we will have  to continue  to think about  what  stress scenarios  will provide  the best test of \ncapital  planning  across  all the major  financial  institutions  and whether  we should disclose  more  \ndetailed  information  on individual  institutions.  \nA strong  reason  for supervisors  to consider  a broader  approach  to transparency  is that \ntoday’s  global  institutions,  with  their  systemic  footprints, can  easily  turn the complexity  of their  \noperations  into opaqueness. This , in turn, then  hinders  the ability  of stockholders, large  creditors  \nand other  parties  to provide  the appropriate  level  of market  discipline.  The annual  repor ts of \nmajor  institutions  do not  include  simple  disclosures, but  contain  a nearly  unending  stream  of \nfootnotes  that attempt to  describe their  operations  because of  the legal  liability  of saying  \nsomething  that might prove  to be misleading.  As a result,  annual  reports  contain  few definitive  \nstatements  and forecasts,  or clear  and specific  statements  about  risk exposures. Unfortunately, \nthis lack  of transparency  leaves  many  investors  to rely on regulators  to ensure  sound conditions  \nat banks —or in the extreme  case,  to protect  these investors  through “too-big-to-fail” policies  and \npublic  assistance.   \n\n6 How can  supervisors  reverse this  trend  and return  market  discipline  to the role it once  \nplayed  in financial  markets?  Transparency  is something  we must  consider  as we continue  to \nwork  on our  stress tes ts and as  we implement new  standards  and limits  in such  areas  as liquidity,  \ncounterparty  risk, concentration  of assets  and risk exposures. We  should work  toward  \nimplementing  standards  that also provide  useful  and accurate information to  stockholders  and \ncreditors . One  way  to accomplish  this is to construct  simple  regulatory  rules  that can be easily  \nunderstood by  the public  and readily  enforced  by examiners.  Regulators  may  also be able to  \npromote  transparency  and enhance  market  discipline  by highlighting  industry  information in  \nways  that inform  the public, such  as the Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation’s  Global  Capital  \nIndex* or considering  the disclosure  of key or material findings  from  examinations.  \n \nMultiple  regulatory  agencies  can be effective \nA final  issue  is the growing  chorus  in many  countries  to reshape the  regulatory  structure,  \nor to at least  rationalize  the structure  we are creating  through regulatory  reforms.  This  has clearly  \nbecome an  important  topic  in Europe  with  the movement  to a single  supervisory  mechanism  and \na single  recovery  and resolution framework.  Structure  and design  are also important  features  in \nthe European Systemic  Risk  Board  and in individual  countries  as they  participate  in these \nconsolidated systems  while  also deciding  how  to meet  their  domestic  responsibilities  in \nsupervision. \nIn the United  States,  we face similar  coordination issues with  a new  Financial  Stability  \nOversight  Council, the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau,  and in meeting  our mandate for \nenhanced  supervis ion of  systemically  important  financial  institutions  at both the  bank and  non-\n                                                 \n* Hoeni g, Thomas.  “Capitalization  Ratios  for Global  Systemically  Important  Banks,”  at \nhttp://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/capitalizationratios.pdf .  \n\n7 bank level.  This  is in addition to  our existing  supervisory  structure,  which  has been  often  \ncriticized  as structurally  flawed,  with  both state  and multiple  federal  banking  regula tors and other  \nregulators  for securities  and insurance  activities.  Given  the United  States’  record  in structuring  \nregulation, I am reluctant  to offer anyone  else advice on how  to design  a supervisory  system.  \nHowever,  my own  experience with  multiple  federal  regulators  and 50 state  supervisors  has \nshaped  my perspective on  how  and why  a complicated  regulatory  structure  can work.  \nWhere multiple  interests  exist —whether  that might be  bank or  non- bank  institutions,  \ndeposit  insurance  authorities,  central  banks, chartering  or consumer  protection  agencies,  or state  \nor federal  entities —it is  important  that the mandated  responsibilities  and the diversity  of views  \nbe reflected  in the supervisory  process . This  diversity  of views  helps  to prevent  one-sided  \napproaches  that might ignore  important  policy  considerations. An  essential  ingredient  in making  \nthis structure  work  and in achieving  all the different  objectives  is cooperation among  the \nappropriate  agencies.  \nIn the United  States,  and as a federal  regulator,  I have come to  appreciate the  value  of \neach state’s  interest  in banking  industry  outcomes  as it closely  relates  to the state’s  economic  \nsuccess.  To ensure that  all stakeholders  participate  meaningfully  in the supervisory  process,  this \nmeans  sharing  supervisory  data,  joint  participation  in examinations  and cooperative  rule-writing.  \nA benefit  of our structure  is that state  and federal  chartering  authorities  can oversee their  \nrespective institutions,  while  the FDIC  can use its supervisory  experience to  gain  better insight  \ninto its deposit  insurance  responsibilities.  The Federal  Reserve’s  role in supervision provides  \nimportant  knowledge  for carrying  out its discount  window  responsibilities , monetary  policy  \nformulation  and its macroprudential  supervisory  role. \n\n8 Of course,  the globalization  of finance  further complicat es this picture,  as we saw during  \nthe crisis  with  foreign  funding  exposures, cross -border  lending  and securities  holdings, and  \nresolutions  that spanned several  countries. Now we  are all involved in  international  efforts  to \nharmonize  capital,  liquidity  and resolution rules —none  of which  can be viewed  as a small \nchallenge.  It is crucial  that we learn  from  the recent  past and establish  strong  lines  of cooperation \nahead  of the next  crisis.   \n \nConclusion  \nLapse s in our supervisory  framework  contributed to the tremendous  and devastating  costs  \nto the global  economy  and demand  that we look for new  ways  to oversee a  complex  financial  \nsystem.  Yet, even  as we deploy  new  tools  and methods , we must  commit to  strengthen  \nmicro prudential  supervision, market  discipline  and cooperation among  regulators. Importantly,  \nthe courage  and leadership  to embrace and enforce  whatever  regime  we adopt  will in  the end \nmake all  the difference  to the outcomes  we seek ."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n  \n \n    \n            \n  \n \nOklahoma History Center  \nOklahoma City  \nOctober 16, 2013  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own  and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n I am honored to be here today as we commemorate the contributions of Senator Robert \nOwen in the establishment of the Federal Reserve System a c entury ago.  \nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is responsible for Federal Reserve activities in \nOklahoma, and we feel a special connection with Se nator O wen, but he also served this state for \nmany years as a teacher, attorney, newspaper publisher, ba nker and United States Senator.  \nIn each of the roles he played throughout his  career, it’s clear that Owen was driven to  \nnot only  succeed , but to serve. He did so by representing the interests of Native Americans in the \nlegal and political systems , by mee ting the needs of small business owners and bank depositors \nin Muskogee, Okla., and by helping establish a more stable financial system for the entire \ncountry by working with others in Congress and the White House to create the Federal Reserve \nSystem.  \nToday, I wi ll focus on his accomplishments in this latter effort, which was one of Owen’s \nmost notable achievements in the Senate.  \nCompromise in Washington is not something that comes about easily. From our \nperspective on current events, we can surely appreciate the significance of Owen’s efforts that \nled to the compromise that established the Federal Reserve.  \n \nRobert Owen’s e xperience \nFirst, I think it’s important to understand Senator Owen’s motivation in pursuing a central \nbank for the nation. His personal experiences dealing with the nation’s recurring financial panics in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would frame his views on banking and economic reform.  \n\n \n2 \n As a teenager, Owen experienced the first -hand effects of a financial crisis. During the \nPanic of 1873, the value of his father’s property was, as Owen put it, “completely destroyed,” \nand in order to meet ends meet, his mother began teaching music.  \nThe financial loss, and the death of his father, eventually led Owen and his mother to \nmove from Virgi nia to this region, where as members of the Cherokee Tribe, they were entitled \nto property. After working for a time as an attorney and a newspaper publisher here, Owen \nturned to banking, opening the First National Bank of Muskogee in 1890. Unfortunately, it \nwould be only a matter of time before a crisis came again.  \nIt was during the Panic of 1893 that Owen once again felt the effect of a financial crisis. \nBut, in addition to the personal impact, Owen, as a community banker, saw how ill -equipped the \nnation’ s monetary system was in meeting the needs of farmers, merchants and workers in this \npart of the country.  \nMore than half of the deposits in Owen’s bank were withdrawn during this panic as \ncustomers hoarded their cash and tried to wait out the crisis. Owen later wrote that the panic \nresulted in “the bankruptcy of hundreds of thousands of people; causing a violent dislocation of business; and throwing out of employment vast numbers of people and inflicting injuries which required years to repair in the indust rial and commercial life of the nation.”  \nThe structure of the nation’s monetary system at this time added to the pain felt in \nOklahoma and the rest of the western United States. The nation’s banks relied on “reserve city” banks in Chicago, St. Louis, and N ew York for liquidity. Once the markets in these cities seized \nup, the effects rippled out to the rest of the country. Banks in the western United States were affected more than others because of the physical distance between them and banks in reserve cities.  \n\n \n3 \n In addition, because Oklahoma’s economy was dependent on agriculture, it experienced \nsharp seasonal credit swings tied to the harvest cycle that led to routine shortages of money. \nVolatile prices also played a role, and when crop prices fell in the lat e 1800s, Oklahoma was hit \neven harder.  \nIt was these factors, along with his personal experiences during the nation’s recurring \nbanking panics that shaped Owen’s views and led him to strongly advocate  for reforming the \nmonetary system . For several years, Ow en published a number of reforms aimed at easing the \neffects of financial crises.  While several lawmakers supported his ideas, none managed to gain \nwide support. \n \nPanic and reform  \nIt would take yet another crisis, this time the Panic of 1907, before any si gnificant reform \nmovement would take hold. \nBy this time, Owen had been selected as one of Oklahoma’s first Senators and was one of \nthe nation’s first senators of Native American descent. However, as a freshman senator from a \nnew state, and a member of the minority Democrat Party, Owen’s legislative proposals for banking reform went nowhere.  \nBy 1913, when Owen’s party had won the majority and he was appointed to serve as \nchairman of the newly formed Senate Banking Committee, he was finally in a position to crea te \nsomething significant and usher in serious reform measures. By then, a commission created by \nCongress in the wake of the 1907 panic had recommended the creation of a National Reserve Association, which would consist of 15 branches located across the country and would be governed by a board of 46 directors.  \n\n \n4 \n While he appreciated the movement toward the creation of a more “elastic currency,” as \nreformers labeled their goal, Owen did not support the Association’s structure, which would \nhave placed the system  under the control of the banking industry.  \nInstead, Owen supported a system involving government control, with centers of reserves \nspread out across the country. Many bankers, especially in money centers like New York, objected to handing over responsibil ity of the banking system and currency to the federal \ngovernment , which they recognized would limit their power . Owen, who was still a director at \nFirst National Bank of Muskogee, recognized these concerns but was more worried about power \nbeing too concentrated, especially on Wall Street.  \nThe debate over the structure of the system continued for some time.  In response to a \ncentral banking bill submitted by Rep. Carter Glass of Virginia in 1913 that would have placed control of the system largely in private hands, Owen proposed his own bill in the Senate that provided for somewhat more government control but still offered a decentr alized, regional \nsystem.  \nThroughout the sum mer of 1913, President Woodrow Wilson had several meetings with \nGlass, Owen and others  at the White House to resolve these differences and build unified support \nfor one central bank proposal. Wilson preferred a government -appointed board for the central \nbank, but he initially favored the Glass bill, which was  the most popular with bankers.  \nIn the following weeks, however, Owen and Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan \npushed for more government control and be lieved such a bill could pass. Wilson ultimately \nagreed, and a version including more government control was put forward that fall for debate in both houses. After months of sometimes intense debate, the Owen- Glass bill, which came to be \nknown as the  Feder al Reserve Act, was signed into law on Dec. 23, 1913.  \n\n \n5 \n The system reflected Owen’s long -standing position that called for monetary reform \nbased on a decentralized system that represented the interests of communities from across the \ncountry. Today, this central  bank, consisting of 12 regional Reserve Banks that are overseen by a \ngovernment body located in Washington, reflects the system of checks and balances that we see \nin other important institutions in the United States.  \n \nA legacy of diversity \nInterestingly, Owen would later become one of the Federal Reserve’s most vocal critics. \nThis criticism was based on the Fed’s response to deflation and financial distress during the \n1920s and 1930s. \nIt might seem unusual for someone to speak out against an institution they helped create. \nOn the contrary, it is clear that Owen understood that in a democracy, no institution, including the central bank, should be immune from criticism. The Federal Reserve is not a monolithic organization, and such feedback—both from outside and inside the organization—ensures that the Fed remains accountable to the public it serves. \nIt is important that the Federal Reserve’s structure today still allows for a range of views \nto be considered when it deliberates actions that affect so many people.  \nThat it remains so is a tribute to Owen, who understood that the diversity of views —even \ndissent —is not confusing, it is clarifying. And that transparency of these views does not create \ncacophony, but enhances credibility.  \nLater in his life and aft er he had retired from the Senate, Owen remained proud of the \nFederal Reserve, despite his often critical views. His personal copy of the Federal Reserve Act and a pen used by President Wilson to sign the law remained his most prized possessions. Just \n\n \n6 \n before his death in 1947, he presented the pen to President Harry Truman and participated in \nceremonies honoring him at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. Today, we take part \nin another ceremony to honor him. A part of Senator Owen’s legacy is refle cted in the institution \nthat he helped create a century ago.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s operations have evolved since 1913, and Congress has clarified \nthe central bank’s specific responsibilities. The decentralized and representative structure that \nOwen envisioned for the nation’s central bank remains a durable feature of the institution and \noffers an effective way to support the U.S. economy.  \nThank you again for the opportunity to speak about Senator Owen and his lasting legacy \nas it relates to the Federal Reserve. I would also like to thank the Oklahoma History Center and \nits staff, Steve Agee, and Gov. Bill Anoatubby for their work on creating this exhibit, which will help tell the story of Robert Owen  and the Federal Reserve’s connection to Oklahoma."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSanta Fe , New Mexico  \nJune 4, 2013  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n I appreciate the opportunity to be in Santa Fe. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nserves a seven -state region that includes this part of New Mexico. Nearly 100 years ago, \nCongress chose to put 12 regional Reserve Banks and their branches across the country because \ndecisions about the nation’s money supply and its financial system are important to the entire \ncountry and affect every business and each citizen.    \nThat’s why  I am in New Mexico this week. These regional connections serve the Federal \nReserve well in unders tanding the economic conditions and business climate that affect the Fed’s \nresponsibilities for monetary policy, supervision and regulation  of financial institutions , and the \nU.S. payments system. I always learn a grea t deal when I tour the region. Between  visits, our \ndirectors and advisory council members serve as our eyes and ears in the vast and diverse region \nserved by the Kansas City Fed. They provide a valuable source of information about the ever -\nchanging economic conditions on Main Street , and t heir reports to us are one of the essential \ninputs I bring to meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I am pleased that so \nmany of those directors and advisory council memb ers are here today. I thank them for their \nservice.  \nMy remarks today refle ct my views on the national economy and on the next steps for the \nFederal Reserve’s monetary policy, which are currently not shared by a majority of the voting \nmembers of the FOMC.  For that reason, I am especially pleased to have this opportunity to \nexplai n my thinking about the economy and monetary policy within the context of a longer -term \nlook at the period of recovery from the financial crisis and deep recession.   \nDuring this period , the FOMC has engaged in an experiment of aggr essive monetary \npolicy e asing. For the most part, these policy actions have few precedents, and therefore, no \nsimple formula exists to direct policymakers on how to eventually return monetary policy to \n\n \n2 \n more -normal settings. Because of this, considerable judgment that is informed by history and \nexperience will be important for guiding future policy choices.    \n \nA Slow But S teady  Recovery  \nThis month marks the start of the fifth year of an economic recovery in the U nited States . \nIt’s been a slow recovery for sure with r eal GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, \ngrowing at about a 2 percent average pace . As a result, the economy has recovered from its deep \nlosses and is now about 8  percent larger than it was in 2009. Over this period, households , \nbusinesses and banks  have been r epairing and rebuilding their balance sheets.  \nThe economy has faced bouts of difficulty during this period of recovery, causing man y \nto doubt its sustainability. Episodes of financial stress and uncertainty driven by events from \nabroad, a s well as by fiscal restraint at home, temporarily interrupted the pace of growth \nthroughout the recovery . Yet, the economy has continued to heal, showing signs of steady \nprogress in a number of important respects, including a sustainable pace of consumer spending, \nimprovements in household net worth and a return of consumer confidence.  Businesses also have \nbeen spending on equipment and software, and corporate profits have been historically high the \npast two years.  \nThe housing sector has recovered more slowly, but has gained notable momentum over \nthe past year. Residential construction is now contributing positively to  real GDP growth each \nquarter. The number of new housing starts has moved well above the post -crisis low , and new \nconstruction is supporte d by improving housing demand, as reflected in rising sales and home \nprices.  \n\n \n3 \n Labor markets  also are continuing to heal. Since the end of 2009, about 6 million jobs \nhave returned . The pace of job growth has been unusually slow  compared to other recoveries , but \nit has been strengthening.  Over the past six months, employment has increased by an average of \nslightly more than 200,000 jobs per month. This pace of job growth  is more than sufficient to \nkeep up with population growth  and put unemployed people back t o work . Initial claims for \nunemployment insurance, which is an indicator of how many people are losing job s, is near its \nlowest point since the end of the recession.  This is notable improvement.  \nEven a s the housing sector , labor market and broader economy continue to move in the \nright direction, growth this year may be tempered once again —this time by fiscal issues  \nassociated with mandated federal government spending cuts and uncertainty about future tax \npolicy and government spending. Business owners I speak with continue to emphasize that \nregulatory uncertainty in a number of areas —including the implementation of health care reform  \n—is causing them to take a more cautious approach when hiring new worker s and making capital \ninvestments.  \nI expect the economy  will push through these obstacles with grow th at about 2 percent \nthis year  with low inflation. By n ext year, growth should pick up to about 3 percent , causing the \nunemployment rate  to continue to fall. \n \nThe F OMC and Its  Policy Choices  \nIt is within this context that I turn now to the polic y choices  that lie ahead for the Federal \nOpen Market Committee . The FOMC’s  decisions about monetary policy are guided by the \nobjec tives given to it by Congress. These objectives require the Federal Res erve to pursue \npolicies that  “…maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate \n\n \n4 \n with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and modera te long -term interest rates.”  Over the \ncourse of the economic recovery, the FOMC has repeatedly intensified its efforts to boost growth \nand speed up the return to full employment.  \nWith short -term interest rates near zero, unemployment high and inflation lo w, the \nFederal Reserve has looked to unconventional policy actions to provide further stimulus in the \ninterest of boosting growth and bringing down  the unemployment rate faster. These actions  \ninclude large -scale asset purchases , more commonly known  as “quantitative easing ,” along with \nconditional commitments to keep rates low for an extended period , also known as “forward \nguidance.”  \nBased on forward guidance from the FOMC, the current exceptionally low level of short -\nterm interest rates is likely to remain in place for some time, at least until the unemployment rate \nreaches 6.5 percent and as long as inflation is not pr ojected to exceed 2.5 percent. To provide \nadditional stimulus when interest rates are near zero, the FOMC has authorized th e purchase of \n$40 billion of agency  mortgage -backed securities  (MBS) and $45 billion of U.S. Treasury \nsecurities each month. At this pace, the Fed’s balance sheet is expanding by more than $1 trillion \nper year. The FOMC reaffirmed this policy stance at its  most recent meeting in late April, not ing \nthat it was prepared to adjust the pace of asset purchases as warranted by the outlook for the \nlabor market or inflation.   \n \nReturning to a long -run focus   \nWith the economy improving and with monetary policy having been extraordinarily \naccommodative for nearly half a decade, the world, it seems, is holding its breath as it waits to \n\n \n5 \n learn wh en the FOMC might adjust its current policy settings . This anxiety follows in part from \nthe fact that a number of g lobal economies have come to depend on central banks to provide \nunprecedented amounts of money to engineer  growth and influence asset values, fearing \notherwise that deflation w ould take hold .  \nIn the United States, f or example, the Federal Reserve has adde d more than $2 trillion in  \nTreasuries and agency -MBS securities  to its balance sheet over the past five years  and continue s \nto add $85 billion each month . To varying degrees , these actions have influenced asset prices , \nsupported financial markets and boosted household wealth.   \nThese unconventional actions  also bring their own uncertainty ab out the outlook for the \neconomy  and increasingly appear to be viewed by markets  and the public as “conventional.”  As \na result, several sectors in the economy are be coming increasingly dependent on  near-zero short -\nterm interest rates and quantitative easing policies. For example, debit balances in security \nmargin accounts at broker -dealers hit an all -time high in April of this year. The rise in these \nbalances indicates that investors are borrowing at very low rates of interest to purchase riskier \nfinancial assets. Presumably, some investors are pursuing this strategy because they anticipate \nthat loans will continue to be available at very low rates of interest, which will allow them to ride \nout any market volatility.  Likewise, an extended period of low rates is causing investors to be \nmore aggr essive about seeking out higher -yielding and riskier assets  in the leveraged loan \nmarket . Leverage d loans are packages of higher -risk commercial loans , which hit an all -time \nhigh in the first quarter of this year.* \nThese issues , among others,  raise a most important question for the F OMC  about when to \nshift its policy focus to the longer run and what steps should be taken now that will return the \neconomy to a state less dependent on monetary stimulus.   \n                                                           \n* Fitch Ratings.  “U.S. Leveraged Finance Market Quarterly: First -Quarter Synopsis.” April 22, 2013.  \n\n \n6 \n Like others, I want to see the U.S. economy grow with healthy job creation . Without \nquestion, more progress is needed in our labor market. While m onetary policy  affects inflation \nand financial stability and influences employment, it cannot singlehandedly fix  today’s high \nunemployment. That will take additional time. In maintaining its present course, the FOMC must \nconsider other pos sible unintended consequences. For example, W ill continuing with current \npolicy and the creation of even greater excess reserves in the banking system result  in more \nlending and economic growth or merely invite asset misallocation?  Are we creating a path to \nstable long-term growth or fostering uncertainty about the impact to the economy when the \nFederal Reserve must unwind its balance sheet?   \nGiven these dynamics , and in light of improving economic conditions,  I support s lowing \nthe pace of asset purchases as an appropriate next step for monetary policy. Moreover, such \nactions would not constitut e an outright tightening of monetary policy, but rather , it wo uld slow \npolicy easin g. History suggests that waiting too long to acknowledge the economy’s progre ss and \nprepare markets for more -normal policy settings carries no less risk than tightening too soon.   \nIn other words , a slowing in the pace of purchases could be viewed as applying less \npressure to the gas pedal, rath er than stepping on the brake. Adjustments today can take a \nmeasured pace as the economy’s progress unfolds . It would importantly b egin to lay the \ngroundwork for a period when markets can prepare to function in a way that is far less dep endent \non central bank actions and allow them to resume their most essential roles of price discovery \nand resource allocation."

I’ve been in the role of Reserve Bank  president for \nmore than  a year and have had  many opportunities to meet with business and community leaders \nwho offer important perspectives on the economy and credit conditions. This insight  shapes my \nview of th e regional and national economy  and provides  essential input to monetary policy \nduring discussions at the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meetings . This regional \ninput , supported by the Federal Reserve System’s structure , was designed to serve the public’s \ntrust, and I believe it enhances the effectiveness of policy.  Certainly , these two days in El Reno \nhave provided insightful perspectives on the local economy.  \nMy remarks today will focus on an outlook for the US economy and my views on the \ncurrent stance of mone tary policy.  \n \nPrivate sector momentum, public sector headwinds  \nThe U.S. econom y continues to grow slowly.  Growth has average d slightly more than 2 \npercent  over the past three  years.  At this pace, it is certainly less robust than other recoveries, but \nhistory does show that recoveries after a financial crisis are often slower.  Importantly, despite a \nvariety of headwinds during  this four -year period, the economy continues to improve in several \nkey aspects.  \nFirst, t he pace of job growth has gradually been  putting people back to work. The \nunemployment rate has declined from its peak of 10  percent  late in 2 009 to its current level of \n7.7 percent . Over  the past six months, private sector payroll  gains have averaged 200,000 per \nmonth . This pace of growth is a positive development in labor market conditions  and compares \nfavorably to pre -recession levels . The average monthly increase in private employment from \n\n \n2 \n 2004 to 2006 was 168 ,000—a period when the housing bubble was fueling economic growth and \njob gains . \nLikewise, the decline in new claims for unemployment insurance  points to an improved \nlabor market . Claims are historically volatile, but t he four-week average number of claims is \ncurrently about 355,000 per week , which is near its lowest level in five years  and almost  half the \nlevel of the previous peak of 66 0,000 per week . This also compares favorably to the average \nnumber of weekly claims from the 2004 to 2006  period at 330,000 per week .  \nImportantly, t hese labor market improvement s are helping to support consumer demand \nand confidence. Consumption has increase d at a 3 percent  annualized pace over the pas t six \nmonths, compared to the 2 percent  pace since the end of the recession. Some of the improvement \nhas come at the cost of a lower sa vings rate, but it also suggests consumers are adjusting to \nhigher gasoline prices and lower take -home pay due to the expiration of the payroll tax holiday.  \nDespite these headwinds, consumer spending has held up quite well in the first two months of \n2013. Consumer sentiment also recently rebounded  after falling sharply in mid -March  with the \nassessment of current economic conditions at its highest level since the end of the recession . \nThe rebound in housing has likely contributed to this improved sentiment . Home prices \nhave risen 8 percent  over the past year  as a result of low inventory levels, boosting household \nwealth and support ing consumption. With low inventories,  home builders are responding by \nincreasing construction activity. Housing starts are up more  than 25 percent  compared to a year \nago, and housing has made a positive contribution to total growth for seven consecutive quarters.  \nLooking  forward, I expect GDP growth this year will likely be about 2 percent and that \nthe unemployment rate will continue  to decline modestly by the end of the year.  This pace of \ngrowth reflects the mandated federal spending cuts  and t he adjustments to the tax code at the end \n\n \n3 \n of last year. Uncertainty about fiscal policy and recurring fiscal de adlines , as well as the \nregulatory environment,  is likely to continue the cautious attitude by business es toward \nexpanding capacity.  \n \nMonetary policy during and after the crisis  \nLast month marked the fifth anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Bear \nStearns , one of th e tremors that announced the financial crisis . The Federal Reserve , along with \nother central banks,  responded aggressively, provid ing liquidity to financial markets and \nmonetary accommodation to cushion the decline in real economic activity. More than four  years \nlater, unprecedented levels of monetary policy accommodation continue.  \nAt its March meeting , the FOMC decided to maintain  its highly accommodative stance of \nmonetary policy by continuing actions approved late last year. Specifically, the Committee \nagreed to continue purchas ing $85 billion monthly in longer -term mortgage and Treasury \nsecurities until the outlook for the labor market has improved  substantially . The size, pace and \ncomposition of the asset purchases  will depend on an assessment of benef its and costs , as well as \non the extent of progress toward the FOMC’s economic objectives.  Additionally , the FOMC \naffirmed that, provided the inflation outlook does not  move above  2½ percent, it expects to keep \nthe federal funds rate near zero until the  unemployment rate reaches  6½ percent.  \n \nEfforts t o speed  up the recovery  \nLarge -scale asset purchases and the commitment  to keep  short -term interest rates near \nzero for an extended period of time are intended to speed up economic growth and get people \nback to work more quickly . Keeping rates low for mortgages and auto loans , for example, can \n\n \n4 \n stimulate borrowing and encourage households and businesses to shift from safe asset s to \ninvestments with more risk, such as corporate bonds and stocks.  With h igh levels of \nunemployment and low inflation , a majority of FOMC members have judged such policies are \nwarranted  and that the benefits continue to outweigh any risks .   \nThere is no question that high unemployment is costly to individuals and results in a l oss \nof output relative to the economy’s long -run potential . In the interest of promoting economic \ngrowth, monetary policy can, and has, played an important role in easing financial conditions as \nthe economy recovers from the recent recession.  Even so, con tinued use of “emergency” policies \nand an extended period of inordinately low rates carry significant risks.  Because of those \nconcerns, I have dissented at the last two FOMC meetings.   \nTo be clear, I support an accommodative stance of monetary policy while the economy \nrecovers and unemployment remains high.  But I view the current policies as overly \naccommodative, c ausing distortions and posing risks to financial stability  and long -term inflation \nexpectations with the potential to compromis e future growth . As the Fed ’s balance sheet \ncontinues to expand , the risks and  costs increase  in my view .  \nA key issue that concerns me is the incentives created by an extended period of zero \nrates.  Typically, central bank actions to lower interest rates in response to a recession and boost \naggregate demand are reversed relatively quickly , and rates return to more normal levels.  In \ncontrast, following this recession, zero interest rates have been in place for more than four  years , \ncombined with l arge-scale asset purchases and a communications program signaling an extended \nperiod of low rates . As a result, the yield curve has flattened , and 10 -year rates have remain ed \nhistorically low .  \n\n \n5 \n Faced with this unprecedented rate environment,  individual and institutional savers, \nsmall er banks, insurance companies and pension funds are challenged to revamp  their portfolios \nand products. Individuals and institutions are placing more emphasis on strategies that entail \nsubstantially greater risk  as they move away from traditional investment -grade products towards \nriskier lending, non -investment -grade products  or equities.   \nBy design, zero interest rates p ush investors from “safe assets” into higher -risk assets and \nthereby  encourage growth.  Whether  this increased risk proves healthy and supportive of \neconomic activity , only time will judge. Some have argued that early signs of excessive risk -\ntaking or overheating in specific sectors of the economy , such as farmland values , high -yield \nbonds or leveraged loans,  can be effectively addressed by regulators or are not yet threatening to \nthe broad economy .  \nFor some time, concern s about the rapid rise in farmland values w ere discounted by the \nfact that significant leverage was not being used.  The shar p rise in lending at the end of last year \nraises concerns that the wealth effect in agriculture could trigger a leverage cycle similar to past \nfarm booms when farm incomes and asset values faded.  \nCertainly, I expect regulators will be focused on such risks and continue to use the \nsupervisory tools available to them, such as the recent guidance issued on leveraged lending.  \nHowever, as we learned from this most recent crisis, emerging risks can be hard to judge and it \ncan be even harder to determine what  action should be taken ahead of any obvious or near -term \nthreat.  In addition, riskier financial activity can grow outside the regulated sector.  For these \nreasons, asking bank regulators and supervisors , or the newly -tasked monitors of financial \nstability , to single -handedly identify and contain the risks introduced by a highly accommodative \nmonetary policy is not realistic . \n\n \n6 \n Likewise, I am concerned that with  the adoption of thresholds for inflation and \nunemployment, the FOMC has expressed some tolerance for having the inflation outlook exceed \n2 percent. A willingness to let inflation rise above its long -term goal carries the risk that longer -\nterm inflation ex pectations rise above the Committee’s 2 percent goal , as well . The current pace \nand composition of asset purchases  also could put the stability of inflation expectations at risk , if \nmarkets perceive that the size of the Fed’s balance sheet could complicate  the return to a more \nneutral monetary policy stance. The FOMC’s exit strategy  – the process of reducing the size of \nthe Fed’s balance sheet and returning short -term rates to their neutral level —will likely begin \nonly well into the future . But  the strategy will need to be carefully executed to minimize market \ndisruptions that could cause longer -term interest rates to suddenly rise.  \n \nPatience for the long r un \nThe economy is making progress in recovering from a deep recession.  I have \nacknowledged the important role that low rates must play in supporting this recovery even as I \nhave raised significant concerns about the current stance of zero interest rates for an extended \nperiod . Can efforts to speed up the pace of growth with u ntested monetary policy tools be \neffective?  The FOMC is carefully considering such issues  and believes the risks are worth \ntaking . However,  our limited understanding of the possible effects of unconventional polic y tools  \ncauses me to give more weight to their risks and eventual consequences.  \nIn raising these issues, it is not my goal to prematurely withdraw support.  It is critical , \nhowever , to ensure we transition from a crisis -type policy stance of aggressive  easing to one of \naccommodation that allows markets, households and businesses to begin to normalize their \nexpectations for interest rates.   In my view , therefore,  we should not underestimat e the risk of an \n\n \n7 \n extended period of zero interest rates and the accompanying incentives that may lead to future \nfinancial imbalances . Such imbalances  could unwind in a disruptive manner and cause the labor \nmarket recovery to stumble. I am concerned that monetary policy at its current settings is overly \naccommodative re lative to the long and variable lags with which it operates.   \nCentral banks must focus on achieving sustainable growth in the long run and be patient \nin pursuing its longer -run goals . Attempt ing to speed up the recovery process create s risks that , if \nrealized , could lead the economy  down a more difficult road back to full employment and price \nstability."

This has certainly been a challenging period for bank supervisors  who took a \nvariety of ad hoc steps during the crisis to deal with troubled institutions and markets , worked to \nmaintain core financial services  and public confidence , and are now  issuing and  implementing a \nlong list of reforms .  \nDespite these well -intentioned  efforts, we should consider whether  the regulatory reforms  \nreflect an effective  response to the issues that surfaced in the recent financial crisis.  Further, we \nshould look to lessons from the past to understand to what extent the approaches used during the \nfinancial crisis may at least partially explain why many countries around the world  are \nexperiencing an economic recovery that has been agonizingly slow.  \nTo illustrate this p oint, I will first look at the policy approaches taken in previous cris is \nperiods  and examine what worked best and what did not. Then I will compare  the response to the \nrecent financial collapse with successful approaches  from the past.  Finally, I will dis cuss my \nview that t here are policy shortcomings that still need to be addressed and ways that we can  \nprovide for a stronger recovery.  \n \nLessons from Previous Crises  \n  As the side effects of the 2008 crisis ha ve lingered and turned into a very slow recovery \nprocess, several reasons  have been given as possible explanations for this  experience . One idea, \nfor example, is  that financial crises are unique  and it takes much longer to recover from them \nthan other econom ic downturns.  Similarly, some contend  that asset price bubble s produce a \n“balance sheet recession .” As a result, people  must  first try to pay down debt and increase \n\n2 \n savings, thus leaving monetary policy and low interest rates less effective in encouraging \nborrowing and expansion.  Another contention is that banks must first work off their bad assets \nand restore capital before they are in position to help promote a recovery.   \n  While all of these carry some truth, we have had major  financial crises in the pas t. In a \nnumber of  cases, the outcomes have been better, setting the stage for relati vely faster recoveries \nwhile also limiting any moral hazard problems that might be carried forward . \n \nUnited States, Sweden and Japan  \n  What the United States did to address  the banking panic  of the 1930s  became the model \nfor much of what was done in Sweden and eventually in Japan.  The banking crisis of the 1930s \nwas the most severe in U.S. history , with the total number of commercial banks declining by \n9,000 , or nearly 40 pe rcent, from the beginning of 1930 to the end of 1933.  About 4,000 banks \nfailed in 1933 alone.  \n  After a one -week banking holiday was declared in March 1933, the Reconstruction \nFinance Corporation (RFC), which was a public entity established in the 1930s to  provide \nsupport to ailing banks and businesses , joined with the banking authorities to quickly assess the \ncondition of every U .S. bank . Each bank was then placed into one of  three categories.  The first  \ncategory included  sound banks that were generally thought to have adequate capital.  A second \ngroup included banks that had lost most of their capital but still had the resources and ability to \nprotect depositors  and remain  viable , and a third group consisted of failing  banks that had lost all \nof their cap ital and would not be able to pay off their depositors in full.  Notably, i n making these \nevaluations, the RFC established a policy that every  bad asset in a bank must  first be written \ndown to its realistic economic value.  \n\n3 \n   The banks in the first group were then reopened promptly after the bank holiday, and \nbanks in the second group were reopened after raising new capital privately or by se lling \npreferred stock to the RFC.  Banks in the third category were placed into conserva torships.  The \nRFC also insisted that any needed changes be made in a bank’s management before RFC funds \nwere injected.  \n  Overall, the RFC was highly successful in promptly restructuring, recapitalizing and \nrestoring public confidence in a U .S. banking syst em that had been in a sharp downward spiral.  \nNearly all of the RFC funds were eventually repaid with virtually no loss to taxpa yers.  Also, the \nRFC’s insistence  that bad assets be written  down to realistic values and poor management be \nreplaced helped to minimiz e moral hazard issues.  The economy continued to remain weak  in the \nyears after 1933 due to a variety of factors, such as the substantial disruption in financial \nintermediation from bank failures, zero interest rates and extreme caution on the part of \nbusinesses to expand their operations by  making new investments and hiring new workers.  \nDespite the soft recovery,  the banking sector  encountered few problems after 1933.  \n   In Sweden, a speculative boom in real estate and bank credit , along with unsustainable \nexchange rate policies,  led to a severe economic downturn and banking crisis  in the early 1990s . \nActions by Swedish authorities closely followed what the RFC did in the  United States.  Swedish \nbanks were classified into three categories that w ere patterned after the RFC approach . This \nanalysis led to a governmental takeover of two of Sweden’s six largest banks, with a third bank \nneeding to raise additional capital.  To restore confidence during the crisis, the Swedish \ngovernment instituted tempo rary guarantees for bank depositors and creditors but left \nstockholders at risk.  \n\n4 \n   One additional element employed in Sweden was the  use of asset management \ncorporations to acquire and resolve the bad assets of the two banks that were taken over . Thus, \ntwo healthy bank ing operations  were  returned to private ownership without significant delay.  As \na result of these steps and a strong economic recovery, the Swedish banking crisis was resolved \nmore quickly than generally expected and at little or no cost to ta xpayers.  \n  In contrast to Sweden, Japan ese authorities  were slow to address the ban king problems \nthat arose after Japan’s  real estate crash in the early 1990s.  Japanese banks became swamped \nwith substantial volumes of bad assets and had little real capital  to support their operations.  As a \nresult , Japan suffered through a series of severe credit crunches for muc h of the 1990s —the so - \ncalled “Lost Decade .” \n  Japan ese authorities  finally took action beginning in 1998 to deal with bank insolvency \nissues and to inject capital into the remainder of the banking system, using the RFC model as a \nguide for these actions.  These capital injections largely ended the credit crunch and were l ater \npaid back with out loss to taxpayer s. \n  A final example  is the thrift crisis in the United States in the 1980s.  This crisis arose from \nthrift institutions holding 30 -year, fixed -rate mortgage loans during a period of rapidly rising \ninterest rates in th e early 1980s.  As market rates jumped well above the contractual rates on \nmany of these loans, a significant number of thrifts were faced with both funding and insolvency \nissues.  However, there was little public commitment  to deal with these issues, given an \ninadequate amount in the thrift insurance fund and little support in Congress for allocating \nmoney to clean up the industry.   \n  Unfortunately, t he primary  response was to give thrifts a wider range of powers in the \nhope of  provid ing a new way out of the ir problems while allowing them to continue operating on \n\n5 \n little, if any, capital base.  This framework led to serious moral hazard issues and a surge in \ncommercial real estate lending by problem thrifts . By the end of the 1980s, a greatly expanded  \nfederal b ailout was needed for  the thrift  industry . \n  The lessons from these previous financial crises are clear.  First, the quickest way to \nrestore prosperity and financial stability is to identify the losses in the financial system and take \ntimely and concerted action to address them.  A guiding rule for supervisors should be that o nce a \nloss in the financial system is incurred, it will not go away on its own and will only delay the \nchances for recovery  and increase the eventual costs . \n  Second, supervisors must b e in a position to identify whic h institutions are viable and \ncapable of surviving a crisis . Supervisors also  need to determine  which institutions  are insolvent  \nand must be  resolved while providing a  chance to  bring them  back to private ownership under  \nnew and more capable management.  \n  Third, moral hazard issues must be considered in the steps take n. Whenever possible , \nregulators should  pursue actions that force the responsible parties to take losses and minimize \nfuture problems.  \n \nRecovering from the R ecent Crisis  \n  Faced with uncertain ty and urgency,  the United States and many other countries did not \nturn to  these lessons or the  crisis resolution model that was used in the United States in the 1930s \nand later adopted in Sweden and eventually in Japan.  In the United States, for instance, public \nauthorities provided significant liquidity assistance and debt guarantees  during the recent \nfinancial crisis , but did  little to pursue corrective measures when granting this assistance.  \n\n6 \n   For example, t he Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was used to inject \npublic capital into U .S. banks, did not follow  the key principles that were used by the RFC in \n1930s to strengthen banks and avoid moral hazard problems.  Unlike the RFC, TARP injected \nfunds indiscriminately into all the major U .S. banks . No attempt was made to  put these banks \ninto different categories based on their condition and viability . Neither were they required to first \nwrite down their problem assets  to gain a perspective into capital needs  and to  force a balance \nsheet cleanup  and minimize  moral hazard concerns.  Equally important, there was no effort to \nassess the quality of management and to insist on changes when needed.  Instead,  attention and \nrestrictions were tied to limiting executive compensation and bonuses after the fact and not to the \nmore critical question of management  capability .  \n  Perhaps one could ar gue that the 2008 crisis was different and did  not lend itself well to \nthe type of actions taken in previous crises.  For example, many claim that today’s financial \ninstruments  are less transparent and are harder to evaluate and price.  Another factor may be the \nsystemic nature of many of the institutio ns involved in this crisis and the global nature of the \ncrisis itself.  \n  These and other characteristics  certainly merit consideration . However , the slow nature of \nthis recovery, the limited amount of new lending after more than four years  and the continuation \nof banking issues  in some countries may suggest that the actions we took left unresolved \nproblems.  In addition, we must consider whether what we are doing is sustainable in the long run \nor whether it only increase s the chance of  futur e crises.   \n  We should first ask ourselves if we have corrected the misaligned incentiv es that were \nbehind this crisis.  Quite clearly, a major issue in the United States and many other countries \nduring the crisis was the public assistance and protection that was given to banks deemed “too \n\n7 \n big to fail.”  We cannot expect to have a sound financial system if the key players in it are not \nheld fully responsible for the choices they make.  \n  The traditional safety nets in most countries already provide incentives for added risk -\ntaking that we all attempt to address, albeit imperfectly, through regulation  and supervision . \nAdding too -big-to-fail protections into our safety nets not only further distorts these risk-taking \nincentives but also puts a much greater degree of pressure on the supervisory framework.  \nEnhanced supervision and the related steps many of us are taking now are unlikely to work well \nas long as major institutions still have incentives to take on added risk.  \n  Another incentive  problem  we should think about is the Basel risk weights.  Regulators \nhave spent a great deal of effort trying to construct a quantitativ e system for linking capital needs \nto risk levels.  Yet the financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that mortgage loans, mortgage -\nbacked securities and sovereign debt were  not the low -risk assets as designated under the Basel \nstandards.  We have also seen that institutions have a remarkable ability to circumvent  standards \nas long as they have an incentive to do so . \n  Regulatory capital measures undoubtedly gave us a misleading picture during the crisis —\nin part because we were reluctant to require that bank holdings be written down to their actual \nvalues, but also because these capital measures failed to  pick up the steep decline in capital that \nbecame evident in  market capitalization  figures  and other market -based measures of capital.  To \nme, all these issues imply that we must have a strong leverage constraint to counteract any \nshortcomings that may exist in risk-based capital standards .  \n  Along with strong leverage ratios, we must have the correct supervisory focus , \nparticularly since  we have not carefully followed some of the lessons of previous crises . For \ninstance, d o we still need to clean up the banks and insist on better management?  In previous \n\n8 \n crises, the first step to a successful recovery was to  admit that some banks had faile d and could \nonly be brought back to life with better management and a clean balance sheet.  \n  With regard to other aspects of supervisory focus , I am especially concerned that we may \nforget the importance of our traditional supervisory tools —microprudential supervision, careful \nexaminer assessments of credit and other banking risks and our evaluations of the quality of bank \nmanagement . Today we are focused on enhanced supervision of the systemically important \nfinancial institutions, stress tes ts, macroprudential supervision  and many other reforms . These \nsteps will not get us very far if we don’t first address the incentive problem s in our financial \ninstitutions , insist on better  bank management  wherever needed and emphasize our traditional \nsupervisory framework.  \n  Enhanced supervision and stress tests, for instance, are likely to draw many resources \naway from traditional supervision.  While the se new supervisory tools have been  useful exercises, \nin the end they may become little more than rou tine, repetitive steps  in satisfying regulatory \nrequirements —much like the Basel risk weights —without contributing to a more effective \nsupervisory process.  \n  \nConclu sion \n  It is said that regulators come in after the battle is over and shoot the wounded.  In this \ncase, many issues remain as we seek to put our respective economies in position for a strong \nrecovery and a more resilient financial system.  I believe we must first  identify and  correct  the \nshortcomings discovered in this crisis.  Previous crises pr ovide an excellent guide  of what works \nwell in re -establishing a strong banking system , as well as what does not work.  Because  each \n\n9 \n crisis is different, we must diagnosis carefully  the risks and outcomes within our financial system \nas a foundation for a stronger economic recovery."

Certainly, we recognize the challenges facing community banks  today . In \nfact, some have question ed whether community banks will be able to effectively compete going \nforward . Others remain optimistic and continue to see opportunities for the community bank \nmodel , as discussed this morning .  \nWithout question, t he recent financial cris is and slow economic recovery are now \nfocusing much attention on the banking industry and its regulatory framework.  In particular, the \nDodd -Frank Act and the proposed Basel III capital rules are bringing major changes to the \nregulatory structure . These include  the new Financial Stability Oversight Council and Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, enhanced supervision and orderly liquidation authority for \nsystemically important organizations, a new regulatory regime for the capital markets and \nfinancial i nfrastructure, and higher and more complex capital requirements . \nUnderstandably, w e often hear from community bankers that they do not expect this \nchanging environment to work  well for them . These bankers  anticipate  being hit with  significant \nregulatory costs  for a crisis that originated in other parts of the financial system . I have similar \nconcerns about the current direction of regulatory policy and how it may negatively affect the \nability of commun ity banks  to be competitive  and serve the credit needs of their communities . \nToday I will discuss my concerns and the importance of ensuring a more equitable landscape for \ncommunity banks.   \n  \n \n \n\n2 \n Previous Challenges  for Community Banks  \nI should begin by acknowledging that community bankers are no strangers to a \nchallenging operating environment.  Over the past few decades, c ommunity banks have \nencountered many challenges and developments that were often thought to favor larger \ninstitutions and threaten the future of community bank s. Some of you here today experienced  \nthose challenges . \nWhen I started at the Federal Reserve  in 1982 , bank expansion laws  were viewed as a \nserious threat . In many parts of our District, we still had a unit banking structure in which banks \ncould only operate o ut of a single office or perhaps with a few  additional limited -service  \nfacilities . Several  District states also did not allow multibank holding companies, and interstate \nbanking was nonexistent  outside of a few special exceptions . \nWhen efforts were begun to relax these expansion restrictions, a common assertion was \nthat larger, expansion -minded institutions would invade  community bank  market s and steal their \nbusiness . We often heard t hat “Multibank holding companies would be the death of  the \ncommunity bank.”  As it happened , the liberalization of bank expansion laws still left many \ncommunity banks in operation , albeit with some reduction in the ir number s and overall share of \nindustry assets.  Many well -managed community banks have been able  to capitalize on this new \nexpansion framework by making acquisitions of their own and spreading their skills over a large r \nbase of operations.  In fact, about  60 percent of bank mergers since 1985 have involved one \ncommunity banking organization acquiring another one.  \nSimilarly, w hen deposit interest rate ceilings were removed in the 1980s , community \nbankers were concerned that larger  banks would be able and wi lling to pay more for deposits \nthan community banks —an outcome many claimed would pull  deposit s out of  community banks \n\n3 \n and destroy  their net interest margins.  Technological change was also thought to favor large \nbanks because they had the resources to be on the cutting edge of such developments as ATM \nnetworks, online banking, automation of banking operat ions, new financial instruments  and risk -\nmanagement models . Finally, community banks have seen c ertain lending and product markets \nshift to larger institutions , captive finance companies , credit unions  and the capital markets.  \nAmong these shifts  have been  credit card  lending , auto loans, equipment lending  and the \ndominant role community banks once had as the principal repository for their customer s’ \nsavings . \nIn all of these cases, community banks have established an innovat ive track record, \nwhether it is an increased ability to manage funding needs by paying competitive deposit  rates , \ndevelop their own expertise in technology and find vendors to provide other services , or discover \nnew services to provide to customers . To be sure, the community bank  business model has \nproven resilient and able to withstand significant challenges when bo ards of directors and their \nmanagement teams demand strong performance and are willing to be flexible and ready to \ncapitalize on new opportunities.  \n \nWhat Characteristics Allow Community Banks to Survive and Pro sper?  \nUnderstanding how community banks successfully overcame these challenges is \nimportant, especially as we consider the direction of today’s financial reforms. I’d like to \nhighlight a couple of studies we’ve done to analyze this.  \nFirst, community banks generally operate with t he right incenti ves and a n effective  \ncorporate governance structure . Many community banks are closely held institutions with the top \nmanage ment  and board members having significant ownership positions.  These ownership \n\n4 \n incentives help to ensure that key policymakers are committed to achieving good performance, \nhave enough a t stake to avoid excessive risk -taking, and also have a vested interest in the health \nof their communities.  This is well understood by community bankers , and it stands in sharp \ncontrast to some of the governance problems apparent at larger banks , especially during the \ncrisis.  Few outside of the community banking sector, though, fully understand the significance \nand implications of this governance structure.  \nThe s taff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has conducted several studies o n \nthe ownership and management structure of community banks .1 We found  that the better \nperforming and safer community banks are those where the major policymakers ha ve much to \nlose if they d o not  make the right decisions.  This concl usion  is significant when we consider  how \ncommunity banks should be supervised compared to larger banking organizations.  \nAnother commonly noted  strength of community banks is that they have close \nrelationships with and detailed knowledge of their customers.  As a general practice,  community \nbanks do  not make “cookie -cutter” loans  and do not offer the same standardized products  as \nlarger banks , but instead tailor their services to the needs  of their customers.  \nWhile  many now claim that the value of customer relationships is declining with credit \nscoring and credit risk models, a recent study at our Bank found that there is real value in \nrelationship  lending and in the soft personal information on customers that community bankers \ntypically have.   \nThis study looked at a large sample of Small Business Administration  loans made by \ncommunity banks  to new businesses and to other businesses with blemished credit records . \n                                                           \n1 Robert DeYoung, Kenneth Spong, Richard J. Sullivan, “Who’s minding the store? Motivating and monitoring hired \nmanagers at small, closely held commercial banks,” Journal of Banking and Finance , July 2001, pp. 1209 -1243; and \nRichard J. Sullivan and Kenneth R. Spong, “Manager wealth concentration, ownership structure, and risk in \ncommercial banks,” Journal of Financial Intermediation , April 2007, pp. 229 -248.  \n\n5 \n Given the inherent risk in such loans , one might expect that having a good personal knowledge \nof these customers would be useful . Not surprisingly, the study found  that default rates on these \nloans were indeed lower when the lending was to businesses  located in the same market as the  \nbank . Defaults were higher  when the borrowers were in a different  market where the bank would \nnot be expected to have the same type of  close personal relationship s with th ese borrower s. \nFurthe rmore , the lowest default rates were in smaller communities where local  banker s \ntypically have lifelong knowledge of their customer s and the closest personal relationships.  This \nresearch suggests that community banks fulfill a very important function in es tablishing close \nrelationships and directing credit to customers whose needs might otherwise go unserved . This \nevidence suggests that policymakers must understand the business model dynamics and \nincentives for banks of all sizes  and must carefully consider the implications of new reg ulation, \nits cost and benefit, and its unintended consequences.  \n  \nA More Equitable and Rational Path for Community Banks  \nGoing forward , community bankers  will be challenged once again to find way s to be \nsuccessful in a  difficult environment, ranging from a n economy that is growing slow ly amid  an \ninterest rate environment that is not especially  conducive to good banking , to a complex and \nburdensome regulatory regime . I will focus my remarks on the latter.  \nThe challenges of regulatory compliance have long ranked among c ommunity bankers ’ \ntop concerns.  And you and I both know that the industry and regulators view risk differently.  For \nexample, in 2006, the banking regulators issued interagency guidance  regarding commercial real \nestate concentrations.  Prior to issuing this guidance, w e received thousands of letters from the \nindustry and members of Cong ress question ing the guidance and causing regulators to back \n\n6 \n away.  As it turned out, some bankers would have been well served to heed this warning.  So, we \nbelieve supervision and regulation can and should play an important role . That said, h aving been \ninvolved in community bank supervision for 30 years, today’s regulatory issues , in my view , \nhave different i mplications .  \nAs you are well aware, m uch of the new regulation is a reaction  to the shortcomings and \nproblems at large banks and within capital markets that contributed to this crisis . Their business \nmodel and related activities and practices , combined with lax supervision , have been well \ndocumented.   The result is a  new regulatory environment  that is substantially at odds with how \ncommunit y banks actually operate.  \nFor example, r esidential mortgage lending is likely to become much more complica ted \ndespite the focus on simplifying disclosures.  This complexity includes new provisions defining \nqualified mortgage loans, requirements regarding a borrower’s ability to repay the loan, risk -\nretention standards, and an array of risk weights under Basel III based on standard mortgage \nlending terms.  In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be rewriting many of \nthe key regulations related to mortgage lending.  \nThis approach of specifying how residential mortgage loans should be structured and \nunderwritten will undoubtedly leave community bankers with far less flexibility and authority to \ntailor such lending to the characteristics of their communities  and customers.  Because of this , it \nis not uncommon to hear commu nity bankers say that th ey may be  force d to cut back \nsubstantially on their home lending activities or even eliminate them entirely.  Such unintended \nconsequences are costly and impede mortgage lending at a time when housing markets are weak.  \nNew capital ru les, known as Basel III , contain  a variety of features that could have a \nsignificant effect on community banks if they are adopted as originally proposed.  I know this \n\n7 \n because I read all 1,000 pages of the draft rule. Some of these include higher and more complex \nrisk weights for selected types of loans and securities, inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on \ncertain debt securities in regulatory capital calculations, the treatmen t of trust preferred securities  \nand additional capital dedu ctions of mortgage servicing assets . \nTo be clear,  I absolutely support efforts to increase the level of capital in our largest \nbanks and improve the quality of this capital,  but I find many of these rules to be costly for \ncommunity banks and of little publ ic benefit  for this part of the industry . Risk weights based on \nstandardized lending terms, for instance, completely ignore the data I referenced earlier —that \nlending relationships and personal information are of substantial value to community banks in \ncontrolling credit risks.  Nor do the higher, more complex risk weights , as well as  the restrictive \nprovisions of Dodd -Frank , accurately reflect the low loss rates that community banks typically \nexperienced on the ir residential mortgage lending and small bu siness  lending  during the crisis . In \naddition, Basel III will almost certainly lead to greater fluctuations in regulatory capital levels at \ncommunity banks even though the underlying assets and risks may not have changed much.  \nFurthermore , we should not forget that  the proposed Basel III rules are designed to be a \nthree -pillar approach, linking capital requirements with supervision and market discipline . \nUnfortunately,  I think  the complexity embedded in the proposed capital requirements fai ls to \nacknowledge that supervisory and market assessments of a bank’s capital are critical factors in \njudging capital adequacy.  In my experience, t he supervision of community banks clearly \nprovides a more refined measure of risk than can be achieve d with o ne-dimensional , static  risk \nweights . And, b ased on the performance of risk weights in the recent crisis, I support efforts to \nstrengthen our supervisory regime for large banking institutions to balance the assessment of risk \nbeyond quantitative measures of  capital.   \n\n8 \n We should also acknowl edge that market discipline plays an important role in community \nbanks.  As our studies have shown, the ownership and management structure of community banks \nprovide s important incentives , as does a strong  corporate governance framework . In the end, \ncommunity bankers know  they are not “too big to fail” and must manage their operations and \nrisk exposures accordingly . \nOverall, the  strength of  the community banking model should tell us that a regulatory \nformat aimed at the largest banking organ izations and the recent crisis is not likely to be a good \nfit for community banks.  Some have advocated for a different regulatory framework for \ncommunity  banks to recognize the difference in business models of large and small banks.  At \nbest, though, this strikes me as only a partial fix.  Until we address the incentive problems and \n“too big to fail” status of our largest financial institutions , the entire financial sector —indeed the \nentire economy —will be vulnerable to future crises.  For that reason, I would argue that we must \nalso take steps to ensure that the largest institutions operate under a framework that encourages \nsafe and sound banking and allows for failure of mismanaged risk.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing, h istory has shown that w ell-managed and innovative community banks are \nwell position ed to handle  the challenges of the future and to take advantage of  new opportunities.  \nThe new regulatory challenges,  though, may be a different type of battle.  I have been involved in \ndiscussions to encourage r egulators to take steps to ensure that commun ity banks are not put at a \ndisadvantage by laws and rules  meant to fix problems that do not exist in community banks . This \nReserve Bank is fully committed to this objective , and I encourage all of you to sh are your \nthoughts with us and with other regulatory agenc ies at every opportunity."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n  \n \n \n \n   \nFinancial Stability Institute – China Banking Regulatory Commission  \nRegional Policy Forum on Financial Stability and Macroprudential Supervision \nBeijing, China  \nSeptember 28, 2012  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n  \nI am very pleased to be here to discuss financial system reforms.  Over the past few years, \nsignificant policy reforms have been adopted in many countries in an attempt to address \nproblems that arose during the financial crisis  and that in many respects  continue to plague our \nfinancial systems . As financial supervisors, we are now in the process of deciding how to \nimplement the new  reforms , while also thinking about  what else should be done. \nI am pleased  to see this confer ence focus on the challenges we now face in supervising \nfinancial institutions and  in creating a more resilient and stable financial system —both \ndomestically and globally.  In fact, the organizers of the conference have structur ed this important \npolicy debate around the  key questions  that we should be asking ourselves.  Among these are:  \nWhat policy tools will be effective, which tools will function as intended, are ther e alternative \nsteps we should consider, and what reforms might remain “ works in progress ” for the \nforeseeable future?  \nFollowing the theme of this conference, I will provide a high -level context for  the steps \ntaken in the United States to  address the financial crisis —many of which mirror actions being \ntaken around the world or by inter national authorities . Then I will offer my own views on \nwhether  these policy steps can be expected to contribute to a more stable financial system while \naddress ing what went wrong in th e crisis.  \n \nFinancial Crisis and Reform in the United States  \nThe financial crisis in the United States was unique in the sense that it was one of the \nmore severe crises in U .S. and global history . It also involved a deep and widespread collapse in \nthe housing sector that had never occurred before in our  country, except perhaps during the \n\n \n2 \n 1930s. The cost of this crisis ha s been exceedingly large and continues  to grow. From the \nstandpoint of direct costs, the conservatorships of Fannie M ae and Freddie Mac—our  two main \ngovernment sponsored enterprises for h ousing —have so far cost taxpayers $187 billion. The \nestimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from failures of depository institutions between \n2008 and 2011 have been more than  $85 billion, and federal authorities provided more than  $245 \nbillion in capital support to depository institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program \n(TARP)—all  but $10 billion of which has been paid back with interest and fees.  \nThese direct costs, though, are just the tip of the iceberg.  The crisis led  to a reduction in \nhome equity in the United States of nearly $7 trillion.  The International Monetary Fund \nestimated that the crisis could result in write  downs of loans and securities in U .S. banks of as \nmuch as $1 trillion. Among other costs related to t he crisis, the fiscal stimulus authorized by our \nfederal government in 2008 and 2009 totaled more than $1 tri llion, and we have also suffered \nfrom large federal de ficits, protracted unemployment  and slow economic growth. Finally, the \ncombination of massive  public assistance and outsized executive compensation has created \nwidespread mistrust and anger directed at large financial  institutions, their regulators  and \ngovernment officials. \nAll of these costs justifiably created substantial pressure for major  reform of our financial \nregulatory system.  Much has been written about the crisis and its spread on a global basis, so I \nwill turn to the key  reforms we are adopting in the United States as  we try to  enhance \nsupervisory focus and create a stronger  financi al system.  \nTwo years ago, the U.S. enacted t he Dodd- Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act  in the hope of bringing greater stability to its financial system.  This act has many  \ncomponents  and introduces a  macroprudential perspective  by creati ng the Financial Stability \n\n \n3 \n Oversight Council. This Council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury Department, with \nnine other voting members drawn largely from the federal financial regulatory agencies and five \nnonvoting members. A major responsibilit y of the Council is to identify and monitor emerging \nrisks or regulatory gaps that might threaten financial stability and to make recommendations for corrective action.  The Council issued its first annual report on financial stability in 2011, and \nanother report was issued in July of this year. These reports have provided a starting point, but there is still much to be done with regard to the very challenging task of  monitoring financial \ntrends and threats to stability  and developing timely and effective responses.  \nThe Council is also charged with identifying nonbank financial institutions whose  \nactivities, financial distress  or failure could pose a risk to financial stability.  The Council has yet \nto identify the specific nonbank companies that will be designated in this manner. Under other authority, t he Council has identified eight systemically important financial market utilities that \nwill be subject to enhanced risk- management standards.  \nAny nonbank companies that are identified as systemical ly important and a ll banking \norganizations with more than $50 billion in total assets will be subject to heightened supervisory standards and prudential supervision by the Federal Reserve , including risk -based capit al, \nliquidity, overall risk -management an d credit exposure reporting, concentration limits, resolution \nplans or living wills , and stand alone risk committees . The Dodd- Frank Act also requires the \nFederal Reserve to conduct annual stress tests of these companies using three different scenarios  \nwith the companies further conducting their own stress tests.  \nThese standards are in various stages of the rulemaking process with the resolution plan \nrequirement being the only one that has been finalized.  Resolution plans have been submitted by \n\n \n4 \n the larg est banking organizations, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal \nReserve are currently evaluating them.   \nOther provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act with  a macroprudential or financial stability \nfocus  include a new resolution authority for financial companies whose failure would pose a \nsignificant risk to financial stability in the United States . This authority would be an alternative \nto our standard bankruptcy process , and the FDIC would act as receiver.  Other provisions \ninclude reform of t he derivatives market to increase its transparency, the Volcker R ule limits on \nproprietary trading and sponsorships of hedge and private equity funds  by banking organizations , \nand risk retention requirements for entities issuing asset -backed securities.  In addition, the act \nmandates count ercyclical capital requirements  calling for  institutions  to build up a capital buffer  \nduring strong economic periods  in order to provide an additional layer of protection during \nperiods of financial stress.  \nOverall, the Dodd -Frank Act  attempts to establish a framework for closer monitoring of \nthreats to financial stability, heightened oversight of syst emically important institutions  and a  \ncountercyclical approach to capital and liquidity.  \n \nWill These Steps Contribute to a  More Stable Financial System?  \nWith out question, the United States needed a strong response to the financial crisis , and \nmany of these new or enhanced supervisory approaches  could be useful if done well. Even so, \nthe magnitude and cost of the crisis demands that  we ask ourselves if these steps are sufficient.   \nHave we addressed the fundamental sources of the problems , and if not, W hat are the unintended \nconsequences?   \n\n \n5 \n First, the misaligned incentives and the expansion of federal safety net protections  \ncodified parts of the financial system as “too big to fail.”  Public safety net s were extended far \nbeyond anything that we , as supervisors and policymakers, had done previously, thus adding \nfurther to moral hazard.  In the United States, deposit insurance coverage was substantially \nincreased during this crisis, bank debt instruments were guaranteed, and a variety of special \ndiscount window programs were created by the Federal Reserve to expand this lending  and reach \na wider range of institu tions. The outcome of all these actions was to protect creditors and \nstockholders of  financial institutions from having to bear the full cost of their decisions  while \nshifting this burden to taxpayers. These actions further raise the question of whether we  have  \nprovide d even greater incentives to take on added risk in the future.  \nWe have attempted to address these issues through the Dodd- Frank Act . Although \nunintended, reforms that call for designating firms as systemically important may reaffirm their status as “too big to fail.”  Additionally , the enormous volume of new regulation s may not \neffectively address the weaknesses.   \nAs we have just seen  during a crisis, public officials face real concerns about creditor or \ndepositor panics, market breakdowns  and losses in public confidence, and possible connections \namong large institutions.  We should acknowledge that such concerns could be more intense \nduring the next crisis if we do not take steps now to strengthen the foundation of the financial system.  We will have to deal with the escalating safety net and associated moral hazard issues \nleft over from this crisis as well as the continued concentration of the industry . Since the end of \n2007, total assets held by the five largest banking organizations in the Unit ed States have risen \nby over  $1.7 trillion, a more than 25 percent increase . \n\n \n6 \n  Thus, reforms must focus on limiting public safety nets and the moral hazard issues they \ncreate and restoring a strong governance framework to ensure that the various participants in \nfinancial markets bear full responsibility for the decisions they make.  With regard to safety nets, \nwe must take a closer look at what they should cover and what activities are appropriate for the institutions that receiv e such protection. In the United States, this discussion is focused on the \nVolcker Rule  limits for proprietary trading , as well as  other proposals for restricting insured \ninstitutions to more traditional activities.  As shown in this crisis, we also must be sure that we \nhave an appropriate regulatory and governance fra mework in place for institutions and markets \nthat operate outside of this safety net protection. \nUnfor tunately, governance and market discipline mechanisms  are at risk of being diluted \nby a panoply of regulations . Nowhere is this more obvious than in the Dodd- Frank Act.  This act \ncontains many provisions that legislate  things bankers sh ould naturally do with the right \nincentive s in place.  For example, the act stat es that bankers cannot make a mortgage loan to a \nperson that does not have the ability to repay the loan. The act also requires  bankers to build up a  \ncapital  buffer in prosperous times to prepar e for more stressful times.  \nRather than adding regulation, we could better align incentives by allowing st ockholders, \nunsecured creditors  and bank management to be ar full responsibility for losses incurred by their \ninstitutions.  We must also  develop the  resolve not to give bank stockholders and creditors a \nrestart with capital injections and other assistance when the ir institutions get to  the brink of \nfailure.  Likewise,  managers and key employees  should have a notable financial stake tied to the \nsuccess or failure of their institution . Specifically,  incentive -based compensation and other \nremuneration for executives  should not be a one -way street  that only goes up and fails to extract \na price for financial losses.  All of these steps are necessary for a more resilient financial system.     \n\n \n7 \n A second reason  for alter ing our supervisory approach is that we risk  adding complexity \nto financial regulation  without increasing the effectiveness of our supervision. The Basel capital \nrequirements are emblematic of this  with the estimation and calibration of thousands of \nparameters —all  of which are likely to  be based on a limite d range of past samples and cycles.  \nThe complexity inherent in these standards continue s to give the most sophisticated financial \ncompanies considerable opportunities to arbitrag e the process.  Experience shows that a ssets that \nregulators felt were relatively safe and deserving of low -risk weights —such  as mortgage -backed \nsecurities and sovereign debt —instead  served as trigger points for the crisis. And by giving such \nassets low -risk weights, regulators may have encouraged greater industry -wide concen tration in \nthese instruments and, accordingly, a more severe crisis.  A number of the capital measures that \nregulators included in Tier I capital also failed to provide a ready means of support when needed.  \nOthers have found that simple capital measures, s uch as leverage ratios,  typically do a \nbetter job of separating strong banks from weak banks when compared to more complex, risk-\nbased measures.1 Our existing regulatory capital ratios  also have proven to be far less responsive \nto and reflective of financial crises and economic downturns than capital measures based on the market capitalization of institutions.  \nThe Dodd- Frank Act  itself  is full of complexity.  This law is  hundreds of  pages  long and \nits mandated rule -making by some estimates could run to as much as 30,000 pages . In contrast, \none of the most significant pieces of U .S. banking legislation, the Banking Act of 1933, is only \n37 pages long , and it included such noteworthy  steps as the  creati on of  federal deposit insurance \nand the separati on of  commercial and investment banking.     \n                                                           \n1 Andrew Haldane and Vasileios Madouros, “ The Dog and the Frisbee ,” Bank of England, given as a speech by \nHaldane at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s 36th Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, \nAugust 31, 2012.  \n\n \n8 \n Will more complex regulations contribute to a more stable financial system?  After having \nspent most of my career as a bank supervisor, I have my doubts. Supervisory lapses exposed \nduring the crisis were not the result of inadequate regulation. Instead, these lapses reflected the \nfailure of  supervisors and market participants to ask and pursue answers to the most basic and \nsimple questions: Are credit stand ards declining , and if so, what are the implications ? What \nhappens when  the surge in housing prices becomes unsustainable?  What  will be the outcome \nwhen the  compensation of key players does not reflect t he risk s and losses they might impose on \ntheir institutions ? Or, What is the likely result when the creditors and stockholders of financial \ninstitutions are protected against losses?  One could argue that posing and answering these simple \nquestions might have given supervisors  far better insight into  the fate of the financial system . \nThis brings me to my  third and final reason to evaluate our supervisory response . As we \nstrive to be macroprudentialists, we must not diminish the importance of microprudential supervision. In fact, we should increase our emphasis on traditional supervision for the largest \nfinancial firms  even as we pursue the new and unproven concepts of macroprudential \nsupervision.  \nFrom a  supervisory perspective, examiners perform such critical tasks as verifying the \nquality of a bank’s assets, understanding the bank’s business model, and evaluating lending standards and other factors that determine its risk exposure. T he judgments and decisions by \nexaminers typically provide the earliest warning signal of problems at both the  bank level and \nacross the entire financial system, and we must continue to provide examiners w ith the \nindependence, authority  and resources to fulfill this role. \nExperienced examiners , especially those who  have been through previous crises , are \nwell-positioned to recognize the type of risk exposures and conditions that could have \n\n \n9 \n macroeconomic implications . There is no substitute for the judgment of experienced examiners \nand for their ability to distinguish between institutions that can withstand significant di stress and \nthose that are no longer viable . In addition, such examiners are in the best position to ask and \nanswer the simple set of questions posed earlier about lending standards, unsustainable trends, \ncorporate governance shortcomings  and improper incentives.  \nThe br eakdown of risk models and risk- management  practices serves as a reminder that \nstress tests and other forms of quantitative analysis, as well as  the tools and conclusions of \nmacroprudential supervisors , are us eful complements to supervision but should not  substitute for \nexaminers and onsite supervision. \n \nConclusion  \nGiven the cost of the financial crisis, policymakers must be determined to mak e the \nfinancial system more resilient and stable . My own diagnosis is that we must address the \nmisguided incentives that set the stage for this crisis.  These include ever -expanding safety nets, \n“too big to fail” policies, and other incentives that inadvertently shift the threat of losses awa y \nfrom responsible parties. \nAdding new and more detailed regulations focus es on addressing the specific weaknesses \nexposed in the last crisis.  Digging deeper to address the misaligned incentives offers the potential \nfor more fundamental change to the system.  Only when financial institutions  and market \nparticipants have to fully consider the risk and consequences of their decisions —verified  with \nstrong supervisory regimes —will we be assured that next time can be different."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n                 \nConference of State Bank Supervisors  \nState -Federal Supervisory Forum  \nSavannah, Ga.  \nMay 22, 2012  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n \n It is a pleasure to be with you today . I have  been coming to these meetings for a number \nof years , and I  have always  appreciated that key supervisory issues that are  highly  relevant to all \nof our agencies  are consistently highlighted on the agenda. This forum provides a  unique \nopportunity for the state and federal agencies to shar e view s and to learn from one another. In \naddition, t his year’s agenda has broadened the forum to include not only state supervisors and \ntheir federal counterparts, but also the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as regulator of \nfederal charters and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   \nSome have questioned  whether this diversity of regulators and views can be effective in \ntoday’s global financial market and whether the current regulatory structure is outdated and \ninefficient.  Over the years, various reforms have been proposed to improve efficiency and \neffectiveness by removing diversity . Even so, the dual banking system in the United States has \nremain ed firmly anchored in the modern world of banking and finance. And over the past 150 \nyears , financial markets in the United States  have developed into world- class centers of capital \nand have led financial innovation. \nCan this diverse regulatory model serve us well in the next ce ntury and allow the United \nStates  to maintain a strong, efficient and innovative banking system ? Does  an increasingly \nconcentrated banking industry demand fewer regulators?  Let me explain why I think this \nstructure has not only survived for 150 years but has proven to be so durable and responsive to our dynamic economy . And what will it take for the system to remain relevant going forward?  \n \nDevelopment and G rowth of the U.S. B anking S ystem\n \nThe United States ’ econom y has benefitted tremendously from  a diverse banking system  \nthat provided the means for efficiently allocating capital from savers to borr owers.  Thousands of \n\n \n state-chartered and federal -chartered financial institutions, most of which are small community \nbanks , allow credit to flow to individuals and businesses , even in remote areas of our country.  \nThe dual banking system owes its beginnings to the introduction of federally  chartered \nbanks with the passage of the National Bank Act of 1864. Prior to that, commercial banks were \ninitiall y organized under charters  granted by state legislatures —a process that became highly \npoliticized . The next step was states ’ instituting free banking laws, which allowed anyone to \nopen a bank as long as they could meet the standards specified in a  state’s banking laws.  Then \ncame the National Bank Act.  While the primary motivation for th is act appears to have been to \nhelp finance the Civil War, the a ct’s basic provisions mirrored key aspects of the free banking \nlaws that states had adopted —specifically free entry and flexibility to adapt to a changing \neconomy. Thus began the competition between state and national bank charters and the emergence of a dual banking system.  \nA report on the dual banking system prepared by the Federal Reserve in 1 930 makes it \nclear that this  system was not intentional.  Rather, as the report claims, it was expected that the \nintroduction of a federal charter and a subsequent tax on state bank notes would incent bankers  to \nconvert to federal  charters . The Fed’s 1930 report raised a number of questions about the need \nfor such a structure and noted various issues with advantages of one charter over the other. Concerns were expressed about the quality of state bank supervision—not unlike the 2012 study to be presented tomorrow. However, I firmly believe that we have a stronger supervisory system —both at the state and federal levels —as a result of dual banking.  \n \n \n\n \n Innovation and Improvement through the  Dual Banking  System  \nThe d ual banking  system  has provided and continues to offer significant benefits to our \nfinancial system and the economy. One of the primary benefits of dual banking is that the \nmultiple options for state and federal charters have led to considerable innovation and \nimprovement in  banking  services . We  have seen these benefits from the beginning.  \nFor example, it  has allowed local bankers, state supervisors and state governments to \nconstruct a banking system closely attuned to the economic needs of each state and supervised by perso nnel with a strong knowledge of the structure and condition of the local econom y. State \nlegislatures and supervisors have a long history of adopting their own set of prudential laws and regulations, consumer protection statutes, and bank chartering and expansion laws —all of which \ngenerally reflect the needs of each state.  \nA second example occurred s oon after the national banking system was esta blished. \nWhile the National Bank Act created greater competition for state chartering authorities and state banks, the playing field became steeply tilted against state banks in 1865 when the a ct was \namended to tax  the issuance of state bank notes.  As you would expect , this competitive \ndisadvantage led to a sharp decline in state banks from about 1,500 in 1864 to about 250 in 1868, whereas the number of national banks rose to about 1,650.  \nCertainly these reforms must have portended the end of state -chartered banking. But s tate \nbanks were able to overcome this uneven playing field and demonstrate their res ilience by taking \nadvantage of the growing importance of  demand deposits a nd the significant benefits they \noffered compared to bank notes . Within 10 years after the note tax, state banks had more deposits \nthan national banks , and within 25 years, there wer e more state banks (about 3,500) than national \nbanks ( about 3,100) .  \n\n \n Since then, a number of innovations resulted from changes in state banking laws . Most \nnotably , we’ve seen the development of NOW accounts, adjustable rate mortgages, home equity \nloans, and interstate banking through the use of regional compacts and nationwide entry laws \nprior to the eventual passage of national interstate banking.  \n \nChoice of Regulators  \nAnother benefit of the dual banking system is that the option to choose a regulator has \nmade bank supervision and regulation much stronger and more efficient. When the National \nBank Act was passed, the choice was between a  state banking regulator and the OCC . Since \nthen, the choice has expanded further with the addition of the Federal Reserve and Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corp. as federal regulator y options  for state banks . In fact, the choice is even \ngreater today because interstate banking allows stat e banks to choose among state banking \nauthorit ies. \nCritics of the dual banking system and the regulatory structure often claim that providing \nbanks a choice of regulator reduces bank safety and soundness and the stability of the financial system by creatin g a “race to the bottom.”  Regulatory choice, they say, leads to regulatory laxity \nas regulators compete among themselves f or larger portfolios  of supervised institutions .  \nThis is an argument without merit, in my view . I have never seen this among the bank \nregulators in my 30 years  at the Federal Reserve. In fact, I find it to be a strange argument, \nespecially when made by economists, because competition is the process that makes market economies efficient.  Choice among regulators provides an important incentive to improve \nexamination processes and ensures examiners have timely training.   \n\n \n Indeed, I would argue that providing banks regulatory choice serves as a check and \nbalance on  supervisory authorities so that they are not  so restrictive that banks are  unable to \nprovide the credit necessary for economic growth. Importantly, I’ve seen no evidence that other \nregulatory structures , including single regulator models, fared better in the most recent crisis.  \n \nPreserving the D ual B anking S ystem  \nYet if the dual banking system is to serve us well going forward, we must be willing to \nmake adjustments that adapt to a changing financial sector . One challenge is in providing states \nwith enough leeway to continue to implement laws and supervis e banks in  a manner most \nconducive to local interests and the state economy. Federal laws have continued to expand in an \neffort to create a more consistent framework across all banks —both state and national. While \nmuch of this is necessary in a nationwide banking  system, we must be careful to strike the right \nbalance in limiting the preemption of state laws and in respecting the authority of state supervisors and legislators. If we fail to achieve this balance, we risk losing many important \nbenefits of the dual ba nking system.   \nIn my view, another critical  challenge is making sure that supervision and regulation are \nconsistent across regulatory agencies and over time, as well as appropriately calibrated to  a \nbank’s business model, activities and complexity .  \nThere are many examples of coordination and cooperation. The Federal Financial \nInstitutions Examination Council is clearly an important forum for coordination and cooperation \namong the state and federal agencies.  State and federal agencies also accept  each other’s exam \nreports and share exam report software.  Also, the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors , state \n\n \n banking agencies, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve cooperated closely in setting up the \nprotocol for the seamless supervision of state banks  operating on an interstate basis. \nWe’ve been successful , although it has not always been easy, in working across agencies \nto discuss, debat e and develop joint notices of proposed rulemakings and to finalize  rules.  If we \nare to achieve our common goal of w ell-managed, well -capitalized  and well -supervised banks, \nwe will need to redouble our efforts to work together in this way.  \nIn closing, it is clear to me that the dual banking system has benefited the U.S. banking \nsystem and the overall economy since its establishment nearly 150 years ago. The diversity provided by this system allowed our economy to grow and to be the most vibrant, innovative and strongest in the world. This system has served the country well for many years, and I believe with the commitme nt of those here today it is a system that can continue to serve the public \ninterest and responsibly promote  economic growth for years to come."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n    \n     \n \n \nDebt, Deficits, and Financial Instability  \n21\nst Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference  \nLevy Economics Institute of Bard College  \nNew York, New York  \nApril 11, 2012 \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Introduction  \nI am very pleased to be here. Once again, the Levy Institute has come up with an \noutstanding program and one that  addresses a very timely and critical issue.   \nThere are many views about wha t went wrong in the financial markets and global \neconomy and what policy steps should now be taken to create a more stable and resilient \nfinancial sector.  To date, we have implemented a number  of changes in monetary, fiscal  and \nfinancial policies to contain the dam age and prevent future crises. Some of these policies focus \non short -term solutions, while others are more long -term focused.  \nIn my remarks, I will look at this issue largely from the longer -term need to build a \nstronger financial system structure.  I will first discuss our recent experience in the financial \nmarkets and where we may have gone wrong from a supervisory and institutional perspective. Then I will turn to what we must do from a long -term perspective to cr eate the type of financial \nsystem that will be better positioned to weather the next crisis.  \n \nOur Recent Experience  \nThis crisis is following much the same pattern of previous financial crises —an inability \nor unwillingness to see the warning signs  and take preventative action , followed by  massive \ndamage, and then working  through the emergency policy steps and the rebuilding  of our \nfinancial system . The aftermath of th is crisis left no question about the enormity of damage that \ncould be inflicted by a financial sector with too much leverage and risk. As a result , the steps we \nare taking to clean up the damage and begin long- term rebuilding take on added importance  \nbecause the polic ies we put in place now will influence —for better or worse —the  likelihood, \nnature  and severity of the next crisis. While we know we cannot prevent the next financial cris is, \n\n2 \n public policy and preventative steps play an important role in establishing the overall stability \nand resiliency of our financial system.  Consequently, getting  these steps right is essential if we \nare to avoid setting the stage for an even more severe crisis.  \nWe must also recognize that our resolve in dealing with financial crises unfortunately \ntends to diminish after a  crisis  passes.  Understandably, f inancial institutions want to get back \nquickly to a more profitable state , and the public wants a prompt and painless return to the \nprosper ity they enjoyed before the crisis.  As a result , policymakers and regulators can face \nsubstantial pressure to back off from implementing tighter oversight, especially if such oversight interferes with financial institutions going back to the ir usual  operat ing parameters.  \nMany policymakers and market participants thus become reluctant when it is time to \nmake the hard judgments about effective reforms and instituting greater risk restraints.  Signs of \nthis are already occurring with the efforts by financial institutions and others to weaken or delay stronger capital standards and other provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act.  Before elaborating on  \nthose issues, though, it is instructive to examin e some of the factors that led  to this crisis.   \nIndeed,  the housing bubb le was a major factor in the crisis, but there is one thing that \nstands  out to me as a banking supervisor: B oth the private marketplace and regulators had \nbecome complacent and greatly underestimated the risks taken on by our financial system.  \nToo many were convinced that we had entered a new era and fully believed that we had \nnew tools that could more accurately measure, price and control risk, even as financial instruments became far more complex and often were untested.  This belief, for instance, led \nsome to think that lower credit standards were simply another factor that could be priced into the terms of a subprime loan, thereby making such loans an acceptable risk. Or that bank leverage ratios were a thing of the past, especially because financial institutions and regulators could risk-\n\n3 \n weight assets and off -balance- sheet exposures and use quantitative risk models to come up with \n“better,” “more accurate,” and, invariably, lower measures of capital needs.  \nAnother factor in the crisis was misguided incentives to take on more risk. These \nincluded low short -term interest rates that encouraged financial institutions and other market \nparticipants to “borrow short and lend long” and to “search for yield.”  These funding and lending \nincentives, along with other factors such as the low Basel risk weights assigned to certain \nfinancial instruments, further motivated major institutions to adopt very similar risk exposures.  \nThese exposures, in turn, contributed to the liquidity and funding breakdowns that were central to this crisis.  Other misaligned incentives included the belief that larger institutions were “too big \nto fail” and the implicit guarantees behind the government -sponsored enterprise s and certain \nother parts of the financi al system —all  of which gave creditors and stockholders added \nprotection from default and less reason to be concerned about risk. \nWe also have had numerous changes in the structure of our financial markets over the \npast few decades, which have left us with a much different corporate culture in banking and finance.  In fact,  the new structure has brought with it a greater focus on short -term performance \nand more aggressive attitudes regarding ri sk-taking.  These changes include  a rapidly rising \nconcentration in the banking industry, withering away of the Glass -Steagall constraints on banks \nengaging in securities activities, and the growth of securitization and money and capital markets.  \nCultural change i n investment banking began to occur more than 40 years ago, when the \nNew York Stock Exchange relaxed its rules to allow member securities firms to break away from their partnership structure and adopt a corporate framework. With partnerships, the driving force had always been to safeguard the value of partnership interests by maintaining the long -run \nprosperity of the firm and developing new partners with similar objectives. Bringing in outside \n\n4 \n capital through conversion to a corporate structure —which  all major  securities firms did by \n1999—put  these firms under gre ater investor pressure to exploit short -term opportunities and \nengage in riskier strategies.  As banks took on more investment banking activities, competitive \npressures then led to similar changes in the culture of banking. The outgrowth of all these \nchanges in the financial system was a complacency and false confidence in new risk-management practices and a substantial  and largely unrecognized build- up in leverage and risk \nthat laid the groundwork for this crisis.  Unfortunately, the pendulum swung from conf idence that  \nwe could measure and control virtually any risk to the opposite —an  environment  during the \ncrisis  where market participants had virtually no idea how to price  many financial instruments \nnor how to determine  which institutions were still sound.  \n \nLooking to the Long R un \nIf we are to construct a stronger financial system, we must address the significant \nproblems and obvious shortcomings that led to the crisis.  First and foremost is to correct the \nmisaligned incentives and the improper expansion of f ederal safety net protections that \nencouraged and enabled institutions to take excessive risks. In addition, I believe we must return \nsupervision to its traditional role of exercising sound judgment and making informed decisions. In recent years, the super visor’s role has become a more passive one, with examiners spending \nmuch time monitoring regulatory c ompliance and tracking the risk -management practices \nadopted by financial institutions.  \nWith regard to correcting the incentives in banking, the most impor tant challenge we face \nis in constructing an appropriate, but carefully limited, public safety net. During this crisis, our safety net was stretched far beyond anything we had previously done, and this expansion in \n\n5 \n safety net protections has left us with a  broad and pervasive range of moral hazard issues. Not \nonly did we expand deposit insurance coverage during the crisis, but we also guaranteed bank \ndebt instruments, used the discount window to lend to nonbank institutions and conduct special lending progr ams, and bailed out large institutions and segments of the financial markets not \ncovered by the traditional safety net.  The largest financial institutions in the United States further \nreceived significant injections of public capital through TARP. Some would argue  the only ones \nnot protected from losses were the taxpayers.  \nIt is hardly a coin cidence that at the center of this crisis w ere a substantial expansion in \npublic safety nets and the presence of major financial institutions , which were treated as being \ntoo big to fail  (TBTF) . This linkage between expanded safety nets and TBTF institutions has  \nincreased in importance over the last few decades, with the growth of one linked to the  growth of \nthe other —all  in a cycle that poses a signi ficant threat to financial s tability . \nThis link between large institutions and special public support has left us trapped in a \npattern in which public authorities believe they must  expand the  safety net each time a crisis is  \nbrought on by excesses in risk- taking  at large institutions . This broadening of the safety net \nfacilitates  the next and even more severe crisis , as new moral hazard issues  are introduced and \nmajor institutions are left with  greater incentives for taking on risk. The critical and definin g \nquestion for us is how to  break  this pattern of growing safety nets and escalating crises, while \nrestor ing much -needed market discipline to the  financial system.  \nI believe the first and most important step that we can take is to eliminate  TBTF  policies . \nThis crisis provided overwhelming evidence that the ingrained response of policymakers is to treat our largest institutions as being TBTF.  With the help of bailouts, TARP money, the \ndiscount window , accommodative monetary policy  and other actions, our larg est institutions not \n\n6 \n only survived the crisis, but in many cases, emerged as even larger players in the financial \nsystem.  \nThe funding, capital  and other advantages that TBTF provides are enormous, and such \nadvantages —as seen in this crisis —remove  important  constraints on risk- taking that financial \ninstitutions would otherwise face from their stockholder s, creditors  and uninsured depositors. \nOne simple example of these advantages is that the five largest U.S. banking organizations in June 2009 wer e given rat ings on their senior  long -term bank debt that on average were four \nnotches higher than what they would have received based on their actual condition alone. One of these organ izations even received an eight -notch upgrade for being TBTF. In a very competitiv e \nmarketplace, such advantages are enormous and highly unfair to those institutions not receiving them.  These ratings advantages conti nue to exist after the crisis —albeit  at a notch or two less \nnow, and investors  have reason to believe that similar advantages may yet exist.   \nWhat can be done to address these moral hazard and TBTF issues?  The Dodd- Frank Act \nprovides an orderly liquidation authority for resolving the failure of a systemically important organization, thus adding to the existing framework  for closing insolvent or nonviable \ncommercial banks.  Having this legal framework, though, is only the first, and perhaps easiest, \nstep in dealing with TBTF.  In fact, during the recent crisis we had a number of powers that might \nhave  been used on TBTF institutions , but were not employed to any notable extent . I’ll offer just  \none example.  \nPart of the discipline associated with taking on expanded powers under the Gramm -\nLeach -Bliley Act was that all depository institutions  in a financial holding company were \nrequired  to remain  well capitalized and well managed.  If not, the company would have 180 days \nto correct the deficiencies or face divestiture of its depository institutions or termination of newly \n\n7 \n authorized financial a ctivities . To the extent that such divestitures or terminations might be \ndifficult to do in the midst of a crisis, the  Act gave the Federal Reserve the flexibility to grant \nadditional time  for such  restructuring s. One might fairly ask whether all of the  major financial \nholding companies  were in strict compliance with these provisions throughout the crisis  or \nwhether pursuing such actions  might have been justified .  \nThus , as we can see from this crisis, the most critical issue in addressing TBTF concerns \nis having policymakers with the resolve to follow through. In a crisis, there will always be \nconcerns about creditor or depositor panics, public confidence issues, interconnections with other \ninstitutions  and disruptions in financial services. While I believe these concerns often are \nexaggerated and can be minimized through the resolution frameworks we now have in place, others will almost certainly have different views.  What we must remember, though, is that \nending TBTF is the only sure way to curtail the expansion of public safety nets and break t he \npattern of repeated and ever -escalating financial crises.  \nA second step we must take is to strengthen bank capital standards  with particular \nemphasis on leverage requirements tied to equity capital. In addition, we should weigh carefully  \nthe lengthy transition period contemplated by Basel III.  There is risk that banks will be caught \nshort again if we adopt a lengthy phase -in period and let banks manage their capital down to the \nminimum transition standards throu gh substantial dividend payouts and stock buybacks.  \nI am cautious about relying heavily on risk- based capital standards for two reasons. First, \nbanks have been quick to arbitrage  whatever risk -based standards are in place, and second, it is \nhard to say tha t our risk weights have been accurate measures of risk.  For example, many \nmortgage -backed securities were constructed to marginally meet the requirements for lower risk \nweights . These risk weights , moreover, bore little relation to the losses banks took on such \n\n8 \n securities during  the crisis.  Instead, we must insist on capital standards that can fully protect \nagainst losses—both expected and unexpected —and we must avoid creating standards that give \ninstitutions incentives to adopt more concentrated risk expos ures.  \nI am also in favor of some constraints on the type of activities that can be conducted by \ninstitutions protected by the safety net.  The expansion in activities conducte d by banking \norganizations over the past few decades has greatly increased the lev el of complexity in such \norganizations, making effective management and supervision of these entities much more \ndifficult.  In addition, this growth in activities has brought with it a changing culture in banking —\none that is more characteristic of investmen t banking  and other parts of the capital markets .  \nAccordingly , the major banking organizations have become much more concerned about \nexploiting short -term opportunities and expanding their risk  exposures , and many of the financial \nincentives provided to key personnel in banking organizations have become more closely aligned with those in investment banking. For these reasons, I support the goals of the Volcker Rule in \neliminating proprietary trading by bank and thrift organizations , and I hope we can deve lop an \nappropriate regulatory and supervisory framework to implement these provisions . We should \nalso take a careful look at other financial activities and their compatibility with public safety nets  \nto avoid a replay of the expanded safety nets and the public assistance that was provided to \nfinancial institutions in  this crisis .  \nMy final comments concern the role of bank examiners. Increasingly, examiners have \nhad to spend more time reviewing risk -management practices at banks and compliance with a \nwide variety of regulations. Th ese demands will grow  as examiners become more involved in \nstress tests, enhanced supervision, living wills and other features of the Dodd- Frank Act.  \n\n9 \n While I recognize these aspects of supervision warrant examiner attention, they should \nnot detract from the more traditional and time -tested efforts of examiners in  verify ing the quality \nof a bank’s assets, understanding  the bank’s business model  and evaluat ing lending standards \nand other factors that shape  risk within a bank. In my e xperience, t he judgments and decisions by \nexaminers typically provide the earliest warning signal of problems at a bank , and we must \ncontinue to provide examiners with the independence and authority to fulfill this role. Also, as \nimpartial observers, exami ners are likely to be in the best position to identify the type of risk \nexposures and conditions that could lead to a crisis, particularly in the case of examiners who have dealt with previous crises. In fact, d uring my career in supervision, I have seen no substitute \nfor the judgment of experienced examiners . This crisis further indicates the need to have \nexaminers with the ability and knowledge to distinguish between institutions that are viable entities capable of withstanding significant financial distr ess and those that can no longer \ncontinue in their current condition. \nThe br eakdown of risk models and risk- management practices during the crisis also  tells \nme that we must not view stress tests, other  forms of quantitative analysis  and models used by \nmacroprudential supervisors as being a substitute or replacement for examiners and onsite supervision. In particular, the breakdown we have seen in models -based approaches suggests that \nwe should not develop a false sense of security from the stress tests and other new supervisory \ntools we are now putting in place. While these tools can be useful additions to supervision, we must recognize the  very important and unique role that examiners have in supervision and their \nability to  bring a strong sense of reality and caution to the oversight of the financial system.  \nMicroprudential supervision must re main an essential and central part of our supervisory \nframework.  \n\n10 \n  \nConcluding Comments  \nWe now face a real challenge in rebuilding our financial system and its supervisory \nframework.  The steps we take today  will either serve us well in the inevitable future financial \nshock, or they will sow the seeds of the next crisis. If we are to be successful, though, we must \nstop and ask ourselves what really went wrong this time and what can we do to construct a more \nstable and resilient financial system.  \nI would like to conclude with a thought very aptly expressed in the Central Ba nk of \nNorway’s 2009 Financial Stability Report: “It is difficult to estimate the probability and price the risk of all possible outcomes in financial markets.  This particularly applies to events that occur \nrarely and have not occurred for a long time…In the long term, public authorities have an important role to play in maintaining a collective memory of previous crises.”"

            "content": "Statement of  \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nbefore the  \nHouse Subc ommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technol ogy \nUnited States House of Representatives  \n \nJuly 26, 2011  \n           \n\nChairman Paul, Ranking Member Clay and members of the subcommittee, thank you for \nthe opportunity to discuss my views  on the economy from the perspective of  president of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and as a 20 -year member of the Federal Reserve System’s \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).    \nThe Fed’s mandate reads:   “The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and \nthe Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit \naggregates commensurate with the economy's long -run potential to increase production, so as to \npromote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term \ninterest rates.”  \nThe role of a central bank is to provide liquidity in a crisis and to create and foster an \nenvironment that supports long -run economic health.  For that reason, as  the financial crisis took \nhold in 2008, I supported the FOMC’s cuts to the federal funds rate  that pushed the target range \nto 0 percent to 0.25 perc ent, as well as the o ther emergency liquidity actions taken to staunch the  \ncrisis .  However, though I would support a generally accommodative mo netary policy today, I \nhave raised questions regarding the advisability of keeping the emergency monetary policy  in \nplace for 32 months with the promise of keeping it there for an extended period. \n I have several concerns with zero rates.  First, a guarantee of zero rates  affects  the \nallocation of resources .  It is generally accept ed that  no good, service or transac tion trades \nefficiently at the price of zero.  Credit is no exception .  Rather, a zero -rate policy  increases the \nrisk of misallocating real resources, creating a new set of imbalances  or possibl y a new set of  \nbubbles.   \nFor example, i n the  Tenth Federal Reserve District, fertile farmland was selling for \n$6,000 an acre  two years ago . That land today is selling for as much as $12,000 an acre, \n\nreflecting  high commodity  prices but also the fact that farmland loans increasingly carry  an \ninterest rate of far less  than the  7.5 percent historic average for such loans.  And with such low \nrates of return on financial assets, investors are quickly bidding up the price of farmland in \nsearch of a marginally better return . \nI was in the banking supervision area during the banking crisis of the 1980s, when the \ncollapse of a speculative bubble dramatically and negatively affected the agriculture, real estate and energy industries, almost simultaneously.  Because of this bubble, i n the Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City’s District alone, I was involved in the closing of  nearly  350 regional and \ncommunity banks.  Farms were lost, communities were devastated, and thousands of jobs were lost in the energy and real estate sector s.  I am confident  that the highly accommodative \nmonetary policy of the decade of the 1970s contributed to this crisis . \nAnother important effect of zero rates is that it redistributes wealth in this country from \nthe saver to debtor by pushing  interest rates on deposits and other types of assets below what \nthey would otherwise be.  This requires savers and those on fixed incomes to subsidize borrowers.  This may be necessary during a crisis in order to avoid even more dire outcomes , but \nthe longer it continues , the more dramatic the redistri bution of wealth. \nIn addition, historically low rates affect  the incentives of how the largest banks allocate \nassets .  They can borrow for essentially a quarter -point and lend it back to the federal \ngovernment by purchasing bonds and notes that pay about 3 percent.  It provides them a means \nto generate earnings and restore capital , but it also reflects a subsidy to their operations.  It is not \nthe Federal Reserve’s job to pave the yield curve with guaranteed returns for any sect or of the \neconomy, and we should not be guaranteeing a return for Wall Street  or any special interest \ngroups . \n\n \nFinally, m y view is that unemployment is high today , in part , because interest rates were \nheld to an artificially low level during the period of the early 2000s.  In 2003, unemployment  at \n6.5 percent was thought to be too high.  The federal funds rate was  continuously lowered to a \nlevel of 1 percent in  an effort to  avoid deflation and to lower unemployment.  The policy worked \nin the short term . \nThe full effect , however, was that the U.S.  experienced a credit boom with consumers \nincreasing  their debt from 80 percent of disposable income to 125 percent. Banks increased their \nleverage ratios —assets to equity capital—from 15- to-1 to 30- to-1.  This very active credit \nenvironment persisted over time and contributed to the  bubble in the housing market.  In just five \nyears, t he housing bubble  collapsed and asset values have fallen dramatically .  The debt levels , \nhowever, remain, impeding  our abilit y to recover from this  recession .  I would argue that t he \nresult of our short -run focus  in 2003 was to contribute to 10 percent unemployment  five years \nlater. \nThat said, I am not advocating for tight monetary policy.  I’m advocating  that the FOMC \ncarefully mo ve to a non- zero rate.  This will allow the market to  begin to read credit conditions \nand allocate resources according to their best use  rather than in response  to artificial incentives.  \nMore than a year ago, I advocated removing the “extended period”  language to prepare \nthe markets for a move to 1 percent by the fall of 2010.  Then , depen ding on how the economy \nperformed , I would move rates back toward more historic levels.  \nI want to see people back to work, but I want them back to work with some ass urance of \nstability .  I want to see our economy grow in a manner that encourages stable economic growth, \nstable prices and long -run full employment.  If zero interest rates could accomplish this goal, \n\nthen I would support interest rates at zero.  In my wri tten testimony, I have included three \nspeeches that describe in more detail my position on monetary policy.    \nMonetary pol icy cannot solve every pr oblem.

I look forward to your questions. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n     \n \n  \nRebalancing Toward Sustainable Growth  \n          \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n               \n \nThe Rotary Club of Des Moines and the Greater Des Moines Partnership  \nDes Moines, Iowa  \nJune 30, 2011  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n2 \n  \nIntroduction \n \nThe U .S. economic recovery is under  way, but it remains more uncertain and volatile \nthan anyone would like. Some believe that the Federal Reserve can speed up t he recovery by \nkeeping the fed eral funds rate near zero , where it has been for nearly two -and-a-half years , and \nby promising  to keep it  there for an extended period. If I judged —or if evidence suggested —that  \na zero rate would solve our  country’ s unemployment problem or speed up the recovery  without \ncausing other adverse consequences , I would support i t. However, monetary policy is not a tool \nthat can  solve every problem.  \nIn today's remarks , I will outline  my current  views on the econom y, and suggest what \nalternative  options and policies our leaders might consider  as we search for ways to build a \nstronger,  more resilient economy .   \n \nU.S. economic conditions  \nFirst, it is a testament to the U.S. economic system that even  as this nation carries a heavy \npublic and private debt burden, the economy is completing its second year in  recovery. The level \nof activity , as measured by  GDP, has now surpassed its pre -recession p eak after growing at a \nnearly 3 -percent pace last year. However, I am concerned that in working to offset the effects of \nthis devastating crisis and to restore the economy to health, an extended zer o-interest -rate policy \nis producing  new sources of fragility that we need to be aware of and allow for  in our future \npolicy choices.  \nGovernments, businesses  and consumers have made financial choices and allocated \nresources with  an understanding  that a zero -interest -rate policy will remain in place indefinitely. \n\n3 \n The longer we leave interest rates  at zero , the more asset values will be defined by these low \nrates and the greater the negative impact will be once the inevitable move up in rates begins.  \nComplicating the fragility around monetary policy, fiscal policy as a pro -growth policy \ninstrument also appears to be approaching its limit . The government’s stimulus efforts to support \nthe economy, along with lower tax revenues, have resulted in historically large fiscal deficit s and \na very large debt level. Without a dramatic change, the deficit and the debt will only become \nmore daunting wi th the rising cost of entitlement programs  and likely higher interest rates . \nFor well over  a decade, t he U .S. consumer has been a principal  source of world demand \nand economic growth. As a result , the United States  has incurred consistently large trade def icits, \ncontributing to imbalances in the global economy. As we have painfully learned from the \nhousing bust, growth built on imbalances is ultimately unsustainable .   \nCircumstances require, therefore, that we transition  from an economy that relies too \nheav ily on  consumption and government spending for growth toward  more sustainable  sources \nof demand and economic pros perity . How we  undertake  this transition  will define our economy \nand country’ s economic future. \nTo start, over the next several years , we must change our national savings, consumption \nand investment  habits . Such shifts, though fundamental to long -term economic health, are \nadmittedly difficult to accomplish. They require changes in behavior and expectations. They involve dramatic shifts in resourc e use, which are not painless as workers are temporarily \ndisplaced and industries are disrupted. The pain is immediate, and the payoff comes slowly. However, the gains also can be significant, as more sustainable long -run economic growth is \nwell worth the effort and sacrifice.  \n\n4 \n In a recent visit to Singapore, I witnessed that nation’s  commitment to job creation. For \nexample, during the recent crisis and recession, Singapore developed a program to retrain \nunemployed workers to ensure they would have the skil ls needed when its manufacturing sector \nrecovered. As is well understood, workforce training matters. I spoke with individuals who \ndescribed the drive to bring new factories on- line, with the goal of bringing a factory on -line \nwith minimal delays  and, by their description , without compromising safety .   \n \nLessons from Germany  \nOther countries have made similar changes  out of necessity or during a time of economic \ndistress such as we are experiencing today. Countries have made deliberate  choices  and not  \nrelied on chance to  change economic incentives and behavior tha t served to improve economic \nperformance. I'm not advocating tha t we pick winners and losers —in fact, that is my big gest \nargument against too -big-to-fail financial institutions. Rather, I have observ ed a number of \ncountries that are building and expanding their manufacturing bases —such as Korea, Singapore \nand China —that have been able to experience strong GDP growth over long periods of time . \nGermany offers an other  example of a country having made sign ificant changes to \naccomplish real employment goals. In the mid -1990s, Germany’s trade defic it was simil ar to that \nof the United States . Since then, Germany has moved away from trade deficits to surging \nsurpluses, while the United States  has continued to r un large trade deficits. Complementing this \nshift, German levels of employment have made great strides, and its unemployment rate has \ntouched its lowest point in nearly 20 years.  \nI am not suggesting that the United States  attempt to be Germany or Singapore , two \ncountries that differ from us in many ways. I am also not advocating that we suddenly strive to achieve a large U .S. trade surplus . This might only create other global imbalances and \n\n5 \n distortions. However, adjustments in our economy are necessary, and other countries have shown \nit can be done.  \nPerhaps the most immediate, and obvious, observation is the simplest: We must change \nour national savings rate. To rebalance the U .S. trade position from deficit to balance requires \nthat the sum of private and public savings match  domestic investment. In other words, a country \nmust not produce less  than it consumes if it wishes to balance its trade position with the rest of \nthe world.  \nDuring the 2000s, Germany’s personal saving s rate increased and is currently about  \ndouble the U.S. rate. German households paid down debt and avoided heavily  relying on debt , in \ncontrast to the United States  and so many other countries’ households.  \nThe pers onal saving s rate in the United States has modestly increased since the start of \nthe recession, which is an important positive trend. Unfortunately, this improvement has been more than offset by the dramatic deterioration in public saving reflected in  the nation’s fiscal \ndeficits. Though a significant amount of the recent deterioration in public finances is related to \nthe U.S. financial crisis, the fact remains that our national savings crisis has been unde r way for \nnearly three decades. Si nce the early 198 0s, our nation has consistently chosen to spend rather \nthan save, as witnessed by the long -term decline in our private saving s rate and our tendency \ntoward fiscal deficits.  Most importantly, when we look across the more developed countries, we \nsee that those with higher national savings rates tend to have smaller trade deficits and higher domestic production per person.  \nGermany has also benefitted from managing unit labor costs in a manner that keeps its \nlabor force globally competitive. Over the last decade, the German economy experienced relatively modest wage increases and important productivity gains. Both of these factors \n\n6 \n contributed to keeping unit labor costs in check. However, another important component of its \nsuccess came in the form of labor polic y reforms.  \nIn the early 2000s, Germany, with labor and management input, passed a series of labor \nmarket enhancements called the “Hartz laws.” These laws modified some of the more generous employee benefits and reduced restrictions on temporary workers and the ability to lay off workers. Germany’s reforms also sought to incentivize unemployed workers to transition to employment by making changes to job training programs for the unemployed and creating targeted subsidies to support some manufacturing job cre ation.  \nFinally, Germany developed export markets by focusing on meeting the needs of parts of \nthe world experiencing the fastest growth and demonstrating strong demand for capital goods  \nthat German manufacturers produce : emerging economies in Asia, Europe and Latin America.  \nThe United States is well- positioned to match this kind of performance, if it chooses to do \nso. For example, since 2000, the share of our exports going to the BRIC countries —Brazil, \nRussia, India and China —has more than doubled. If we ch oose to increase our savings rate, if \ngovernment, labor and management see the mutual advantage of investing in and building a competitive manufacturing environment, then job growth will follow. \nAs the U.S. economy shifts gears to shrink its trade imbalanc es, many parts of the \ncountry will have a role to play. I fully expect Iowa to be an inte gral participant in this shift. \nIowa already possesses a strong manufacturing base that is a key driver of the state economy. By some estimates, about half of the manufacturing firms in the state are small - and medium -sized \nenterprises, which provide some parallels with Germany’s renowned export powerhouses, known as the Mittelstand . \n \n \n\n7 \n Real solutions versus economic shortcuts  \nRebalancing our economy and improving our trade position is a necessary development, \nbut unfortunately , it will take time. And as our immediate desire  is to rush to improve our \neconomy, I warn against the all -too-common impulse to take shortcuts and suffer their \nunintended consequences. Here in Io wa, for example, one area where I suspect this tradeoff \nmight be playing out is in the recent rapid run -up in agricultural land prices. \n Agricultural exports have played a significant role in the rapid rise of land prices . Since \n2000, agricultural exports from Iowa  have increas ed by a factor of six . A portion of this growth \nreflec ts surging commodity prices due to factors  on the supply side —such as extreme weather in \nparts of the world— and on the demand side, including the well -documented, rapidly growing \nfood demands of emerging economies.  \nIn addition to anticipated strong future demand for agricultural commodities, there is \nanother factor affecting these prices: exceptionally low interest rates. As a bank regulator in the \n1980s , responsible for financial i nstitutions in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, \nWyom ing, Colorado and New Mexico, I witnessed the devastating effects of easy credit and \nleverage in ag riculture, real estate and energy. We closed or assisted nearly 350 banks in our  \nregion alone.  \nWith interest rates near zero and with additional massive liquidity poured into our \neconomy, all interest rate s are affected. Therefore, asset values of every kind are also being \naffected, including land values in Iowa. Loans for land are available at rates wel l below historical \nlevels —in some instances, 400 basis points below historical averages. The effect on land assets, \nlike any asset, is to artificially boost its value. And there is ample experience that tells us that if rates were to rise quickly, this would affect world demand for commodities and raise the cost of \n\n8 \n capital o n land almost instantly. When —not  if—the  adjustment occurs, we will see a dramatic \ndrop in values. In the meantime, if operators and speculators have incurred large amounts of \ndebt, then a new crisis will emerge.  \nFinally, we know that a crisis can affect more than one segment of the economy. It nearly \nalways affects the broad economy and emp loyment. Shortcuts don’t work. We need to focus on \nthe real economy. We need to focus on real refor m.  \n \nConclusion   \nMy point today is simply that as powerful as monetary policy is, it some times is not \nenough. It cannot ensure an economy that balances it s savings and investing needs. It by itself \ncannot correct o ur current account deficit or enhance savings and investment. These will require \nimportant changes in our real economy. Providing the right environment in which government \ncan play its role in supporting business and the consum er to save, invest, manufacture  and \nservice national and glo bal needs  in the end will create real income and wealth.  \nWe need to focus on l ong-term, stable monetary policy and fiscal policy goals that \nsupport these broader goals. Having seen the effects of financial crisis after financial crisis as short -term policies beget short -term policies, we should know that an ever -present short -run \nfocus, even if well intentioned, is the road to ruin.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE' S MANDATE: LONG RUN \n \n        \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n             \nNational Association of Business Economists Annual Meeting \nDenver, Colo.  \nOctober 12, 2010  \n \n           \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, \nofficers or representatives.   \n\n2 Introduction and Framework \nThank you, and it is a pleasure to welcome you to Denver . This is the largest \nmetropolitan ar ea in the Tenth Federal Reserve District and home to one of three branches of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The Denver branch serves Colorado, Wyoming and New \nMexico —three of the seven states of our region.  \nI appreciate this opportunity to engage and interact with business economists from around \nthe country regarding the policy choices now confronting the nation, especially those confronting the Federal Reserve.  \nIn setting out my views, I’ll first spend a minute describing the economy’s performan ce \nand then turn to the matter of quantitative easing versus my preferred path of gradual steps to a \nrenormalization of monetary policy.  \n \nShort -Term Outlook  \nCurrently, a major and necessary rebalancing is taking place within our economy . This \nincludes the deleveraging of consumers, businesses and financial institutions , and it's during a \ntime that state and local governments are struggling with budgets and mounting debt loads. In this context, a modest recovery with positive overall data trends should be se en as highly \nencouraging .  \nFollowing a bounce back from restocking earlier this year, the economy has slowed but it \nhas not faltered . GDP growth has averaged about a 2½ percent annual pace since the first of the \nyear. Industrial production is showing growt h of almost 6 percent , and high- tech more than \ndouble that. The consumer continues to buy goods, with personal income growing at more than a 3 percent rate, personal consumption expenditures at about 3 percent, and retail sales at more \n\n3 than 4 percent. And the U.S. economy has added more than  850,000 net new private sector jobs \nsince the first of the year . While modest, these are positive trends for the U.S. economy.  \n The issue is , of course , that while private jobs are being added within the economy, it is \nnot enough to bring unemployment down to where we all would like to see it . Unemployment \nremains stubbornly high at 9.6 percent . With such numbers, there is, understandably, a desire and \nconsiderable pressure for the Federal Reserve to “do something, anything” to get the economy \nback to full employment . And for many, including many economists, this means having the \nFederal Reserve maintain its zero interest rate policy or further still, enga ge in a seco nd round of \nquantitative easing – now called QE2. Some are even suggesting these actions are necessary for \nthe Federal Reserve to comply with its statutory mandate.  \n \nInterpreting the Policy Mandate \nThe FOMC’s policy mandate is defined in the Fe deral Reserve Act, which requires that: \n“The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate \nwith the economy's long- run potential to i ncrease production, so as to promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates .”   \nThere is , within the Act, a clear recognition that our policy goals are long -run in nature . \nIn this way, the Act reco gnizes that monetary policy works with long and variable lags. Thus, the \nFOMC should focus on fostering maximum employment and stable prices in the timeframe that monetary policy can legitimately affect – the future . The FOMC must be mindful of this fact a nd \nbe cautious in pursuing elusive short -term goals that have unintended and sometimes disruptive \neffects.  \n\n4 In recent weeks, some have argued that with inflation low  and the jobless rate high, the \nFederal Reserve should provide additional accommodation. Such an action  – the purchase of \nassets by the centr al bank as a policy easing tool – would mark a second round of quantitative \neasing . While there are several ways to accomplish this, many suggest that the most likely \nmethod would be for the Federal Reser ve to purchase additional long- term securities, including \nU.S. Treasuries.  \nProponents of QE2 argue that it would provide a near -term boost to the economy by \nlowering long- term interest rates while raising inflation . These benefits would arise from the \npurchase of U.S. Treasury securities, which would lead to lower U.S. Treasury and corporate \nrates. These lower interest rates would then stimulate consumer and business demand in several \nways, including encouraging mortgage refinancing that could lead to incr eased consumer \nspending, boosting exports through a likely lower exchange rate, and fostering higher equity prices, thereby creating additional wealth . Such a move is said to be consistent with the FOMC’s \nSeptember 21, 2010 announcement, which stated that it was “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  \nSuch easing, it is hoped, would bring inflation back up to something closer to 2 per cent, a \nrate that many judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate. In addition, higher inflation would increase demand as consumers move purchases forward to avoid paying higher prices in the future.  \nSo, with these purported benefits, why would anyone disagree?  \n   \n\n5  New Risks and QE2  \nI believe there are legitimate reasons to be cautious when considering this approach . A \nmeaningful evaluation of QE2 must consider not simply whether benefits actually exist but, if \nthey do, how large they are and whether they are larger than possible costs.  \nBased on recent research and the earlier program of purchasing long -term securities —\nknown as LSAP —I think the benefits are likely to be smaller than the costs.  \nSome estimates suggest that purchasing $500 billion of long -term securities might reduce \ninterest rates by as little as 10 to 25 basis points. The LSAP program was effective, in part, because we were in a crisis . Financial markets were not functioning properly, or at all, during the \ndepths of the financia l crisis. In such a situation, it is reasonable that central bank purchases \nwould be useful and effective. However, currently the markets are far calmer than in the fall of 2008. The financial crisis has passed and financial markets are operating  more norm ally. One \ncould argue, in fact , that with markets mostly restored to pre -crisis functioning, the effect of asset \npurchases co uld be even smaller than the 10 to 25 basis point estimate .  \nI would also suggest that even if we achieved slightly lower interest rates, the effect on \neconomic activity is likely to be small. Interest rates have systematically been brought down to \nunprecedented low levels and kept there for an extended period. The economy’s response has been positive but modest.  \nIn fact, right now t he economy and banking system are awash in liquidity with trillions of \ndollars lying idle or searching for places to be deployed or , perhaps more recently , going into \ninflation hedges . Dumping another trillion dollars into the system now will most likely mean \nthey will follow the same path into excess reserves, or government securities, or “safe” asset purchases . The effect on equity prices is likely to be minor as well . There simply is no strong \nevidence the additional liquidity would be particularly effec tive in spurring new investment, \n\n6 accelerating consumption, or cushioning or accelerating the deleveraging that is hopefully \nwinding down.  \n If the purported benefits are small, what are the possible costs?   \nFirst, without clear terms and goals, quantitative easing becomes an open- ended \ncommitment that leads to maintaining the funds rate too low and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet too large . The result is a further misallocatio n of resources, more imbalances  \nand more volatility.  \nThere is no working framework that defines how a quantitative easing  program would be \nmanaged . How long would the program continue , and what would be the ultimate size?  Would \npurchases of long- term assets continue until the unemployment rate is 9 percent or 8 percent or  \neven less?  Would purchases continue until inflation rises to 2 percent or 3 percent or more?  Would the program aim to reduce  the 10 -year Treasury rate to 2 ¼ percent or 2 percent or even \nless?  Without answers to these and other questions, QE2 becomes an open- ended policy that \nintroduces additional uncertainty into markets with few offsetting benefits.  \nAs central b ank assets expand under quantitative easing , what will be the exit strategy?   \nIn the midst of a financial crisis, we may not have the luxury o f thinking about the exit strategy . \nIn current circumstances, however, we must define an exit strategy if the objective is to raise inflation but contain interest rate expectations. If history is any indication, without an exit strategy the natural tendenc y will be to maintain an accommodative policy for too long.  \nWhile I agree that the tools are available to reduce excess reserves when that becomes \nappropriate, I do not believe that the Federal Reserve, or anyone else, has the foresight to do it at the rig ht time or right speed. It may work in theory . In practice, however, the Federal Reserve \ndoesn’t have a good track record of withdrawing policy accommodation in a timely manner.  \n \n\n7  \nSecond, we risk undermining Federal Reserve independence.  QE2 actions approach \nfiscal policy actions. Purchasing private assets or long -term Treasury securities shifts risk from \ninvestors to the Federal Reserve and , ultimately , to U.S. taxpayers. It also encourages greater \nattempts to influence what assets the Federal Reserv e purchases. When the Federal Reserve buys \nlong-term securities  – such as  the $1.2 trillion in mortgage backed securities it purchas ed during \nthe financial crisis – it favors some segments of the market over others . And when the Federal \nReserve is a ready buyer of government debt, it becomes a convenient source of cash for fiscal programs . During a crisis this may be justified, but as a policy instrument during normal times it \nis very dangerous precedent.  \nThird, rather than inflation rising to 2 or 3 percent, and demand rising in a \nsystematic fashion, we have no idea at what level inflation might settle . It could remain \nwhere it is or inflation expectations could become unanchored and perhaps increase to 4 or \n5 percent . Not knowing what the outcome might be  makes quantitative easing a very risky \nstrategy . It amounts to attempting to fine -tune inflation expectations —a variable we cannot \nprecisely or accurately measure—over the next decade.  \nAnd why might inflation expectations become unanchored?   \nThe budget deficit for 2011 is expected to be about $1 trillion. Even if the Federal \nReserve were to purchase only $500 billion—and this amount in itself is a source of considerable \nuncertainty —that would appear to monetize one -half of the 2011 budget deficit . In addi tion, the \nsize of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet —now and over the next decade —will influence \ninflation expectations. Expanding the balance sheet by another $500 billion to $1 trillion over the next year, and perhaps keeping the balance sheet at $3 tri llion for the next several years, or \n\n8 increasing it even further, risks undermining the public’s confidence in the Fed’s commitment to \nlong run price stability, a key element of its mandate.  \nWhile QE2 might work in clean theoretical models, I am less confid ent it will work in the \nreal world . Again , I will note that the FOMC has never shown itself very good at fine -tuning \nexercises or in setting and managing inflation and inflation expectations to achieve the desired results.  \n Given the likely size of actions  and the time horizon over which QE2 would be in place, \ninflation expectations might very well increase beyond targeted levels, soon followed by a rise in long-term Treasury rates, thereby negating one of the textbook benefits of the policy.  \n \nNon-Zero Rat es as an Option  \nAt this point, with a modest recovery underway and inflation low and stable, I believe the \neconomy would be better served by beginning to normalize monetary policy . If long run stability \nis the goal, then re -normalizing policy is an importa nt step toward realizing that goal . How might \nwe achieve this goal?   \nFirst, rather than expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by purchasing additional \nU.S. Treasury securities, the Fed should consider discontinuing the policy of reinvesting principal  payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities into Treasury securities. \nGiven where we are, we would need to make such a change slowly but systematically . Allowing \nmaturing mortgage backed securities  to roll off, the Federal Reserve’s balance s heet would \nshrink gradually, with relatively small consequences for financial markets.  \nSecond, we should take the first early steps to normalize interest rate policy . This is not a \ncall for high rates but a call for non- zero rates . In 2003 the FOMC delayed our efforts to raise \nrates . In that period we reduced the federal funds rate to 1 percent and committed to keeping it \n\n9 there for a considerable period. This policy fostered conditions that let to rapid credit growth, \nfinancial imbalances and the eventual f inancial collapse from which we are still recovering . Had \nwe been more forceful in our action to renormalize policy then, it’s likely we might have suffered far less in 2008 through 2010.  \nAlso, any effort to renormalize policy would include signaling a cl ear intention to remove \nthe commitment to maintain the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent “for an extended period.”   As the public adjusts to this, we should then turn to determining the pace at which we return the funds rate to 1 percent . Once there, w e should pause, assess  and determine what additional \nadjustment might be warranted. A 1 percent federal funds rate is extremely accommodative, but from that point we could better judge the workings of the interbank and lending markets and determine the ord er of policy actions th at would support sustained long -term growth.  \n \nOther Concerns Regarding Zero Rates  \nThese are difficult times , no doubt , and it is tempting to think that zero interest rates can \nspark a quick recovery . However, we should not ignore the possible unintended consequences of \nsuch actions . Zero rates distort market functioning , including the interbank money and credit \nmarkets; zero rates lead to a search for yield and , ultimately , the mispricing of risk; zero rates \nsubsidize borrowers at the expense of savers.  \nFinally, it is important to note, that business contacts continue to tell me that interest rates \nare not the pressing issue. Rather, they are concerned with uncertainties around our tax structure; they are desperate to see this matt er settled . They need time to work through the recent \nhealthcare changes; and they are quite uncertain about how our unsustainable fiscal policy will be addressed . They are insistent that as these matters are addressed, they will once again invest \nand hire . QE2 cannot offset the fundamental factors that continue to impede our progress.  \n\n10  \nConclusion  \nWe are recovering from a set of shocks , and it will take time. These shocks did not \ndevelop overnight, but came after years of interest rates that were too low, l everage that was too \nhigh, and financial supervision that was too lax. If we have learned anything from this crisis, as \nwell as past crises, it is that we must be careful not to repeat the policy patterns we have used in previous recoveries, such as 1990- 91 and 2001. If we again leave rates too low for too long out \nof fear that the recovery is not strong enough, we are almost assured of suffering these same consequences yet again . I am fully committed to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to maintain \nlong-run growth so as to promote effectively the goals of ma ximum employment, stable prices  \nand moderate long- term interest  rates.  \n\n \n \n \n \nWhat About Zero? \n \n  \n \n      \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n                \n \n    \nSanta Fe, N.M. \nApril 7, 2010 \n \n \n \n\n  1Introduction \nGood afternoon.  I’m pleased to be in New Me xico today, and I extend my congratulations \nand best wishes to the city of Santa Fe on its 400th anniversary.   \nLast week, The Wall Street Journal’s  front page featured an artic le with a headline focused on \nthe “epic comeback” of the corporate bond market. Th e article chronicled how a record $31.5 billion \nin new high-yield, high-risk “junk” bonds came on the market last month and how investments in \nbond mutual funds last year were the highest on reco rd. Thanks to the combination of near-zero short-\nterm interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities, \ninvestors are flush with cash. And, as is sometimes the case, cash earning so little is an enticement to \ntake on additional risk in hopes of higher returns.  \nThe bond market is not the only place where we are seeing the impact of cash-rich investors. \nOur contacts within the Tenth Federal Reserve Distri ct have shared anecdotal information suggesting \nthat operators and investors in the Midwest are buy ing farmland and bidding up the price. We’ve seen \nthis in the agricultural regions of our District in th e past, notably in the run-up to the banking crisis of \nthe 1980s. \nEvents such as these, along with new economic re search now coming to light, are beginning to \ndocument a story about long-run risks that are creat ed when money and credit are easy for too long, \nwhen interest rates are near zero, and when fina ncial imbalances risk macroeconomic and financial \ninstability.  \nAs we all know, the last couple of years have been an extraordinary period in our nation’s \neconomic history.  In response to the crisis, th e Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to drive \ndown long-term interest rates and provide direct support to a fragile housing market. This was in \naddition to the steps taken by the administration and the Treasury.  We will long study these events.  \nAlthough we may disagree on the specifics of the actions taken during that period, most agree that \nwithout strong intervention, the outcome would have been dire.   \n\n  2But as the economy turns the corner and we move  beyond the crisis, what about the challenges \nwe now face, and what about policy actions over th e next several quarters?  The economy appears to \nbe on the road to recovery, and we find ourselv es having to face important questions of how the \nFederal Reserve will unwind the policy response to the crisis.  In particular, what are the hazards of \nholding the federal funds rate target close to zero?   The risks of raising rates too soon are clear and \ncompelling.  My comments, however, concern the risks of  raising rates too late.  Such risks also can be \nsignificant but all too often seem more distant and less compelling, and therefore hold great long-term \ndanger for us all. \n \nThe economic outlook \nAs a preface to a discussion on the issues, I first should outline my expectation for the U.S. \neconomy.   Policy choices can be realistically c onsidered only after first defining how we judge \ncurrent conditions and our outlook for the future.   \nFrom my vantage point, the outlook is generally good.  A number of indicators suggest the \neconomy has begun to recover and is expanding at a steady pace since hitting bottom last summer.  \nGDP grew nearly 4 percent in the second half of last  year, and growth of almost 3 percent is expected \nin the first quarter of this year.  The pace of gr owth should modestly pick up over time, and looking \nahead, I expect GDP growth of about 3 percent for 2010. \nWhile labor markets remain weak, they seem to have stabilized.  The pace of job losses \ngradually slowed over the course of 2009 and early 2010.  In the first three months of the year, unemployment has remained essentially unchanged at 9. 7 percent. Importantly though, Friday’s report \nfrom the Labor Department showed the largest increase  in non-farm payrolls in three years with more \nthan 160,000 jobs added.   Further, forward-looki ng indicators such as temporary help services, which \nhas grown rapidly since the middle of last year, s uggest broader job growth will continue. This is good \nnews because such progress is essential for sustai ned growth.  And like most, I am following it \n\n  3carefully.   Unfortunately, it tends to lag the rec overy and makes the implementation of policy always \ndifficult to manage during the early stages of a recovery. \n  Consumer spending has been growing at a so lid pace, and most forecasters put first quarter \nconsumption growth at more than 3 percent.  These are critical improvements because consumer spending, which has accounted for about 70 percent of GDP, will be a critical force strengthening the \nrecovery.  The manufacturing sector has followed th e consumer and also has been expanding at a \nstrong pace.  Production has increased at an annual rate of about 8 percent since hitting bottom last \nsummer.  In turn, business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up.   \nThese are encouraging signs that the forces n ecessary for a sustained recovery seem to be \nmoving into place and that this is not just a temporary boost from the fiscal stimulus package and \nsharp slowing in the pace of inventory liquidation.  \nResidential and non-residential construction continues to struggle, although to varying \ndegrees.  Residential construction spending has falle n sharply in the last few months after a strong \nuptick in the second half of last year, thanks in la rge part to the homebuyer tax credit.  Looking ahead, \nspending should pick up considerably in response to  the extended tax credit and then rise at a more \nmoderate pace after the credit expires.   \nThe picture is considerably bleaker for the non -residential sector.  Private spending fell at an \nannualized rate of more than 25 percent in the last th ree months and is likely to fall further for most or \nall of this year.  There has been an increase in v acancy rates for office, reta il, and industrial space. \nMeanwhile, non-residential property values are down.  The soft market is due in part to problems with \nfinancing.  With many banks facing the prospect of considerable losses in commercial real estate, \nlending remains weak.  \nLooking at the economy more broadly, inflati on has drifted lower in recent months and is \nfollowing the pattern common during and after a recessi on.  While energy prices have kept consumer \nprice inflation at around 2 percent, inflation in non- food and non-energy price – core inflation – stands \n\n  4at about 1 percent.  In the absence of any current cost pressures from tight labor markets or other input \nprices, inflation will likely remain low for the next year or two.    Risks of a commitment to near-zero rates \nWith the economy gradually recovering from a sev ere recession, monetary policy is by any \nmeasure highly accommodative. The key challenge fo r the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market \nCommittee, is the question, “For how much longer should it remain so?” \nThe FOMC statement, issued after several mee tings including the most recent, has said that \n“conditions will likely warrant keeping the fed funds rate, which is our key monetary policy tool, at \nexceptionally low levels for ‘an extended period.’” Th e statement elaborates that this view is based on \n“economic conditions, including low rates of resource  utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable \ninflation expectations.”  \nBy itself, the current state of the economy warrants an accommodative monetary policy.  \nHowever, as the economy continues to improve, risks emerge around the act of holding rates low for \nan extended period. \nI have dissented at the last two FOMC meeti ngs specifically because I believe the “extended \nperiod” language is no longer warranted and I am c oncerned about the buildup of financial imbalances \ncreating long-run risks. \nThere is no question that low interest rates stimulate the interest-sensitive sectors of the \neconomy and can, if held there too long, distort the allocation of resources in the economy.  Artificially low interest rates tend to promote consumer spending over saving and, over time, \nsystematically affect investment decisions and th e relative cost and allocation of capital within the \neconomy. \nToday, as we look back over the past decade, there is a case to be made that too many \nresources were channeled into financial market ac tivities and into real estate construction, both \nresidential and non-residential. Some researchers ha ve argued that keeping interest rates very low in \n\n  52002-2004 contributed to the housing boom and bust.  Exceptionally low rates, while perhaps not the \nsingle cause, played an important role in crea ting the conditions leading to our recent crisis. \nWe now find ourselves with a Federal Reserve System balance sheet that is more than twice \nits size of two years ago.  The federal funds rate is near zero and the expectation, as signaled by the \nFOMC, is that rates will remain so for an extended period.  And the market appears to interpret the \nextended period as at least six months.  Such acti ons, moreover, have the effect of encouraging \ninvestors to place bets that rely on the continuan ce of exceptionally easy monetary policy.  I have no \ndoubt that many on Wall Street are looking at this as a rare opportunity.    \nThese actions are not taken to enrich one group over another.  They are taken with the well \nintended purpose of assuring a strong economic recovery  and to create an environment of sustained \njob growth and strong business investment.  I take no  exception to this goal.  However, the unintended \nnegative consequences of such actions are real and severe if the monetary authority goes too long in \ncreating such conditions.   \nLow rates, over time, systematically contribut e to the buildup of financial imbalances by \nleading banks and investors to search for yield.  The Wall Street Journal  article tells a story about the \nmarket coming back that also makes my point.  The search for yield involves investing in less-liquid \nassets and using short-term sources of funds to in vest in long-term assets, which are necessarily \nriskier.  Together, these forces lead banks and inv estors to take on additional risk, increase leverage, \nand in time bring in growing imbalances, perhaps a bubble and a financial collapse. \nI make no pretense that I, or anyone, can reliably identify and “prick” an economic bubble in a \ntimely fashion.  However, I am confident that holding rates down at artif icially low levels over \nextended periods encourages bubbles, because it encour ages debt over equity and consumption over \nsavings.  While we may not know where the bubbl e will emerge, these conditions left unchanged will \ninvite a credit boom and, inevitably, a bust.   \n \n \n\n  6What next? \nSo, what options are available to policymakers? I appreciate the inclination for staying the course that financial markets have come to expect:  \nkeeping the federal funds rate target near zero and maintaining a commitment to very low rates for an \nextended period of time.  That view is motivated by  concerns over an unemployment rate of nearly 10 \npercent and persuaded by the fact that co re inflation remains below 2 percent.  \nContinuing with current policy may also refl ect confidence that the longer-term risks of \nfinancial imbalances are quite small and could be mitigated as they emerge.  The Federal Reserve \ncould correct imbalances through in terest rate action or regulatory changes as the imbalances become \napparent later. \nHowever, in times of uncertainty policym akers tend to reassure themselves that an \naccommodative course of action can be reversed always  in a timely fashion.  Inevitably, though, the \npolicy bias is to delay, to let accommodative conditi ons stand, and to reverse only when the economy \nis beyond recovery and into an expansion.  The ou tcome too often is greater inflation, significant \ncredit and market imbalances, and an eventual financial crisis. \n An alternative policy option is to be more proactive, but cautious.  This would require \ninitiating a reversal of policy earlier in the recove ry while the data are still mixed but generally \npositive.  Small reversals in rates would leav e policy highly accommodative and supportive of our \neconomy’s recovery but would put more weight on mitigating the risk of longer-run financial \nimbalances.  It would end the borrowing subsidy more quickly and would moderate credit conditions \nin a more timely fashion.  It would reduce the like lihood that inflationary pressures might build, or that \nfinancial imbalances might emerge.  And over time it would contribute to greater macroeconomic \nstability.   \nUnder this policy course, the FOMC would init iate sometime soon the process of raising the \nfederal funds rate target toward 1 percent.  I would view a move to 1 percent as simply a continuation \nof our strategy to remove measures that were origin ally implemented in response to the intensification \n\n  7of the financial crisis that erupted in the fall of 200 8.  In addition, a federa l funds rate of 1 percent \nwould still represent highly accommodative policy.  From this point, further adjustments of the federal \nfunds rate would depend on how economi c and financial conditions develop.   \n \nConclusion \nAs we look forward from here, I expect that a ll options will be considered and discussed fully \nas we navigate the course of monetary policy.  As we consider our choices, I want to end my remarks \nby emphasizing that I am confident all of us wa nt the best outcomes for the U.S. economy.  The \nFederal Reserve understands its mission of stable prices and long-term, stable growth.  Perhaps \nbecause I have been part of the history of the cen tral bank for these past three decades, I am as \nconcerned about the introduction of instability in to the economy as I am about managing it when it \noccurs.  I am convinced that the time is right to put the market on notice that it must again manage its risk, be accountable for its actions, and cease its re liance on assurances that the Federal Reserve, not \nthey, will manage the risks they must  deal with in a market economy."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n               \n \nThe Rotary Club of Des Moines and the Greater Des Moines Partnership  \nDes Moines, Iowa  \nJune 30, 2011  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n2 \n  \nIntroduction \n \nThe U .S. economic recovery is under  way, but it remains more uncertain and volatile \nthan anyone would like. Some believe that the Federal Reserve can speed up t he recovery by \nkeeping the fed eral funds rate near zero , where it has been for nearly two -and-a-half years , and \nby promising  to keep it  there for an extended period. If I judged —or if evidence suggested —that  \na zero rate would solve our  country’ s unemployment problem or speed up the recovery  without \ncausing other adverse consequences , I would support i t. However, monetary policy is not a tool \nthat can  solve every problem.  \nIn today's remarks , I will outline  my current  views on the econom y, and suggest what \nalternative  options and policies our leaders might consider  as we search for ways to build a \nstronger,  more resilient economy .   \n \nU.S. economic conditions  \nFirst, it is a testament to the U.S. economic system that even  as this nation carries a heavy \npublic and private debt burden, the economy is completing its second year in  recovery. The level \nof activity , as measured by  GDP, has now surpassed its pre -recession p eak after growing at a \nnearly 3 -percent pace last year. However, I am concerned that in working to offset the effects of \nthis devastating crisis and to restore the economy to health, an extended zer o-interest -rate policy \nis producing  new sources of fragility that we need to be aware of and allow for  in our future \npolicy choices.  \nGovernments, businesses  and consumers have made financial choices and allocated \nresources with  an understanding  that a zero -interest -rate policy will remain in place indefinitely. \n\n3 \n The longer we leave interest rates  at zero , the more asset values will be defined by these low \nrates and the greater the negative impact will be once the inevitable move up in rates begins.  \nComplicating the fragility around monetary policy, fiscal policy as a pro -growth policy \ninstrument also appears to be approaching its limit . The government’s stimulus efforts to support \nthe economy, along with lower tax revenues, have resulted in historically large fiscal deficit s and \na very large debt level. Without a dramatic change, the deficit and the debt will only become \nmore daunting wi th the rising cost of entitlement programs  and likely higher interest rates . \nFor well over  a decade, t he U .S. consumer has been a principal  source of world demand \nand economic growth. As a result , the United States  has incurred consistently large trade def icits, \ncontributing to imbalances in the global economy. As we have painfully learned from the \nhousing bust, growth built on imbalances is ultimately unsustainable .   \nCircumstances require, therefore, that we transition  from an economy that relies too \nheav ily on  consumption and government spending for growth toward  more sustainable  sources \nof demand and economic pros perity . How we  undertake  this transition  will define our economy \nand country’ s economic future. \nTo start, over the next several years , we must change our national savings, consumption \nand investment  habits . Such shifts, though fundamental to long -term economic health, are \nadmittedly difficult to accomplish. They require changes in behavior and expectations. They involve dramatic shifts in resourc e use, which are not painless as workers are temporarily \ndisplaced and industries are disrupted. The pain is immediate, and the payoff comes slowly. However, the gains also can be significant, as more sustainable long -run economic growth is \nwell worth the effort and sacrifice.  \n\n4 \n In a recent visit to Singapore, I witnessed that nation’s  commitment to job creation. For \nexample, during the recent crisis and recession, Singapore developed a program to retrain \nunemployed workers to ensure they would have the skil ls needed when its manufacturing sector \nrecovered. As is well understood, workforce training matters. I spoke with individuals who \ndescribed the drive to bring new factories on- line, with the goal of bringing a factory on -line \nwith minimal delays  and, by their description , without compromising safety .   \n \nLessons from Germany  \nOther countries have made similar changes  out of necessity or during a time of economic \ndistress such as we are experiencing today. Countries have made deliberate  choices  and not  \nrelied on chance to  change economic incentives and behavior tha t served to improve economic \nperformance. I'm not advocating tha t we pick winners and losers —in fact, that is my big gest \nargument against too -big-to-fail financial institutions. Rather, I have observ ed a number of \ncountries that are building and expanding their manufacturing bases —such as Korea, Singapore \nand China —that have been able to experience strong GDP growth over long periods of time . \nGermany offers an other  example of a country having made sign ificant changes to \naccomplish real employment goals. In the mid -1990s, Germany’s trade defic it was simil ar to that \nof the United States . Since then, Germany has moved away from trade deficits to surging \nsurpluses, while the United States  has continued to r un large trade deficits. Complementing this \nshift, German levels of employment have made great strides, and its unemployment rate has \ntouched its lowest point in nearly 20 years.  \nI am not suggesting that the United States  attempt to be Germany or Singapore , two \ncountries that differ from us in many ways. I am also not advocating that we suddenly strive to achieve a large U .S. trade surplus . This might only create other global imbalances and \n\n5 \n distortions. However, adjustments in our economy are necessary, and other countries have shown \nit can be done.  \nPerhaps the most immediate, and obvious, observation is the simplest: We must change \nour national savings rate. To rebalance the U .S. trade position from deficit to balance requires \nthat the sum of private and public savings match  domestic investment. In other words, a country \nmust not produce less  than it consumes if it wishes to balance its trade position with the rest of \nthe world.  \nDuring the 2000s, Germany’s personal saving s rate increased and is currently about  \ndouble the U.S. rate. German households paid down debt and avoided heavily  relying on debt , in \ncontrast to the United States  and so many other countries’ households.  \nThe pers onal saving s rate in the United States has modestly increased since the start of \nthe recession, which is an important positive trend. Unfortunately, this improvement has been more than offset by the dramatic deterioration in public saving reflected in  the nation’s fiscal \ndeficits. Though a significant amount of the recent deterioration in public finances is related to \nthe U.S. financial crisis, the fact remains that our national savings crisis has been unde r way for \nnearly three decades. Si nce the early 198 0s, our nation has consistently chosen to spend rather \nthan save, as witnessed by the long -term decline in our private saving s rate and our tendency \ntoward fiscal deficits.  Most importantly, when we look across the more developed countries, we \nsee that those with higher national savings rates tend to have smaller trade deficits and higher domestic production per person.  \nGermany has also benefitted from managing unit labor costs in a manner that keeps its \nlabor force globally competitive. Over the last decade, the German economy experienced relatively modest wage increases and important productivity gains. Both of these factors \n\n6 \n contributed to keeping unit labor costs in check. However, another important component of its \nsuccess came in the form of labor polic y reforms.  \nIn the early 2000s, Germany, with labor and management input, passed a series of labor \nmarket enhancements called the “Hartz laws.” These laws modified some of the more generous employee benefits and reduced restrictions on temporary workers and the ability to lay off workers. Germany’s reforms also sought to incentivize unemployed workers to transition to employment by making changes to job training programs for the unemployed and creating targeted subsidies to support some manufacturing job cre ation.  \nFinally, Germany developed export markets by focusing on meeting the needs of parts of \nthe world experiencing the fastest growth and demonstrating strong demand for capital goods  \nthat German manufacturers produce : emerging economies in Asia, Europe and Latin America.  \nThe United States is well- positioned to match this kind of performance, if it chooses to do \nso. For example, since 2000, the share of our exports going to the BRIC countries —Brazil, \nRussia, India and China —has more than doubled. If we ch oose to increase our savings rate, if \ngovernment, labor and management see the mutual advantage of investing in and building a competitive manufacturing environment, then job growth will follow. \nAs the U.S. economy shifts gears to shrink its trade imbalanc es, many parts of the \ncountry will have a role to play. I fully expect Iowa to be an inte gral participant in this shift. \nIowa already possesses a strong manufacturing base that is a key driver of the state economy. By some estimates, about half of the manufacturing firms in the state are small - and medium -sized \nenterprises, which provide some parallels with Germany’s renowned export powerhouses, known as the Mittelstand . \n \n \n\n7 \n Real solutions versus economic shortcuts  \nRebalancing our economy and improving our trade position is a necessary development, \nbut unfortunately , it will take time. And as our immediate desire  is to rush to improve our \neconomy, I warn against the all -too-common impulse to take shortcuts and suffer their \nunintended consequences. Here in Io wa, for example, one area where I suspect this tradeoff \nmight be playing out is in the recent rapid run -up in agricultural land prices. \n Agricultural exports have played a significant role in the rapid rise of land prices . Since \n2000, agricultural exports from Iowa  have increas ed by a factor of six . A portion of this growth \nreflec ts surging commodity prices due to factors  on the supply side —such as extreme weather in \nparts of the world— and on the demand side, including the well -documented, rapidly growing \nfood demands of emerging economies.  \nIn addition to anticipated strong future demand for agricultural commodities, there is \nanother factor affecting these prices: exceptionally low interest rates. As a bank regulator in the \n1980s , responsible for financial i nstitutions in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, \nWyom ing, Colorado and New Mexico, I witnessed the devastating effects of easy credit and \nleverage in ag riculture, real estate and energy. We closed or assisted nearly 350 banks in our  \nregion alone.  \nWith interest rates near zero and with additional massive liquidity poured into our \neconomy, all interest rate s are affected. Therefore, asset values of every kind are also being \naffected, including land values in Iowa. Loans for land are available at rates wel l below historical \nlevels —in some instances, 400 basis points below historical averages. The effect on land assets, \nlike any asset, is to artificially boost its value. And there is ample experience that tells us that if rates were to rise quickly, this would affect world demand for commodities and raise the cost of \n\n8 \n capital o n land almost instantly. When —not  if—the  adjustment occurs, we will see a dramatic \ndrop in values. In the meantime, if operators and speculators have incurred large amounts of \ndebt, then a new crisis will emerge.  \nFinally, we know that a crisis can affect more than one segment of the economy. It nearly \nalways affects the broad economy and emp loyment. Shortcuts don’t work. We need to focus on \nthe real economy. We need to focus on real refor m.  \n \nConclusion   \nMy point today is simply that as powerful as monetary policy is, it some times is not \nenough. It cannot ensure an economy that balances it s savings and investing needs. It by itself \ncannot correct o ur current account deficit or enhance savings and investment. These will require \nimportant changes in our real economy. Providing the right environment in which government \ncan play its role in supporting business and the consum er to save, invest, manufacture  and \nservice national and glo bal needs  in the end will create real income and wealth.  \nWe need to focus on l ong-term, stable monetary policy and fiscal policy goals that \nsupport these broader goals. Having seen the effects of financial crisis after financial crisis as short -term policies beget short -term policies, we should know that an ever -present short -run \nfocus, even if well intentioned, is the road to ruin."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n            \n   \nPew Financial Reform Project and New York University Stern School of Business  \n“Dodd- Frank One Year On”  \nWashington, D.C. \nJune 27, 2011  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n \n2 \n Introduction  \nWe are approaching the one- year anni versary of the D odd-Frank Act. With so much of the Act’s \nimplementation work unfinished, it is not an anniversary that we can  celebrate; rather it is an o pportunity \nto take stock.  In that vein, I congratulate the organizers of this conference for bringing together such an  \nexcellent group of individuals to do just that. In particular , I want to recognize the New York University  \nStern School of Business  and economics faculty for the outstanding research they have done on critical \nfinancial reform issues. Their collaborative efforts have produced a series of must -read books that have a \ncombination of rigorous economic analysis and  practical policy prescriptions that is rarely seen these \ndays.  \nMuch of the Dodd- Frank discussion revolves around the economic distortions and disruptions \ncaused by the largest and most complex financial companies, the so- called systemically important \nfinancial institutions, or SIFIs.  \nAs we consider the topic of SIFIs, let me ask the following questions:  How can one firm of \nrelatively small global significance merit  a government bailout?  How c an a single investment bank on \nWall Street bring the world to the brink of financial collapse?  How can a single insurance company \nrequire  billions of dollars of public funds to stay solvent and yet  continue t o operate as a private \ninstitution?  How can  a relatively small country such as Greece hold Europe financially hostage? These \nare the questions for which I have found no satisfactory answers. That’s because there are none. It is not \nacceptable to say that these events occurred because they involved systemically important financial \ninstitutions.  \nBecause there are no satisfactory answers to these questions, I suggest  that the  problem with \nSIFIs is they are fundamentally inconsistent  with capitalism.  They are inherently de stabilizing to global \nmarkets and detrimental to world growth. So long as the concept of a  SIFI exists,  and there are  \ninstitutions so powerful and considered so important that they require special support and different rules , \nthe future of cap italism is at risk and our market economy is in peril.  \n\n \n3 \n To more fundamentally address this issue, we must go beyond today’s Dodd- Frank . We must \nconfine the use of the safety net to its original intent. We must reduce the artificial complexity of exist ing \nfinancial structures. The rewards of success must be balanced against the credible  consequences of \nfailure . In achieving such goals, we will  enhance the stability of the fundamental mechanism through \nwhich monetary policy is conducted and the economy depends . \n \nThe decline in competition and accountability in banking  \nThe U.S.  economy is the most successful in th e history of the world. It achieved this success \nbecause it is based on the rules  of capitalism, in which  private ownership domina tes markets and \nindividuals reap the rewards of their success.  However, f or capitalism to work,  businesses, including \nfinancial firms,  must be allowed, or compelled, to compete freely and openly  and must be held \naccountable for their failures.  Only under thes e conditions do  markets objectively allocate credit to those \nbusinesses that provide the highest value.   \nFor most of our history, the United States  held f ast to these rules of capitalism . It maintained a \nrelatively op en banking and financial system  with thousands of banks from small community banks to \nlarge global pl ayers that  allocated credit under this system . As late as 1980, the U.S. banking industry was \nrelatively unconcentrated, with 14,000 commercial banks and the assets of the five largest amounting to \n29 percent of total banking organization assets and 14 percent of GDP.  \nToday, we have a far more concentrated and less competitive banking system . There are fewer  \nbanks operating across the country , and the five largest institutions control mo re than half of the \nindustry ’s assets, which is equal to almost 60 percent of GDP. The largest 20 institutions control 80 \npercent of the industry ’s assets, which amounts to about 86 percent of GDP.  \nHere’s t he irony: T his marked increase in concentrated power , and  therefore , more concentrated \nrisk, reflects past efforts to assure greater economic stability.  This might best b e described as “good \nintentions/ bad outcomes ” syndrome. For example, the Federal Reserve was founded following the 1907 \nBanking Panic  and was charged with providing liquidity support to solvent banks that were experiencing \n\n \n4 \n funding problems. A fter the Great Depression, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  was created to \nprovide limited deposit insurance to protect small depositors and to further increase the resiliency of the \nfinancial system.  \nThen, over the past 30 years, this safety net has expanded far beyo nd its original intent.  More \nrecently , Glass- Steagall was repealed , giving high -risk firms almost unlimited access to funds generated \nthrough their new access to the safety net.  Finally, following a series of crises during the late 1980s and  \n1990s, the government confirmed that because of systemic impact, some institutions were just too big to \nfail—the largest institutions could put money in nearly any asset regardless of risk , and their creditors \nwould not be held accountable for the risk taken. Predictably, the industry's risk profile increased \ndramatically. The SIFI was born.  \nIs it any wonder then that in the fall of 2008 we experienced the greatest financial crisis since the \nGreat Depression? Financial institutions had  again become irresponsible in their lending practices.  They \nhad increased their leverage ratios to unprecedented levels.  They became “dry kindle” for a financi al fire \nand, with the end of the housing boom, the match was struck.   \nNow, with their bailout costs amounting to billions of taxpayer dollars, SIFIs are larger  than ever. \nStrikingly, they are argu ing that th ey should not be held to stronger  capital standards if  the United States  \nhopes to remain globally competitive.  That assertion is nonsense.  The remainder of my remarks today \nwill describe how the United States  can achieve a stronger, more stable financial system in order to secure \nits futu re as a global economic leader.  \n  \nProposal to reduce costs and risks to the safety net and financial s ystem  \n Following this financial crisis, Congress and the administration turned to the work of repair and \nreform. Once again, the American public got the s tandard remedies —more and increasingly complex \nregulat ion and supervision . The Dodd- Frank reforms have all been introduced before, but financia l \nmarkets skirted them.  Supervisory authority  existed , but it was used lightly because of political pressure \nand the misperceptions that f ree markets, with generous public support, could self -regulate.   \n\n \n5 \n  Dodd- Frank adds new layers of these same tools , but i t fails to employ  one remedy  used in the \npast to assure a more stable financial system —simplification of our financial structure through Glass -\nSteagall -type boundaries . To this end, t here are two principl es that should guide our effort s to restore such \nboundaries . First, institutions  that have access to the safety net should be restricted to certain  core \nactivities that the safety net was intended to protect —making  loans and taking deposits —and related \nactivities consistent with the presence of the safety net.  \n Second, the shadow bank ing system should be reformed in its use of money market funds and \nshort -term repurchase agreement s—the  repo market . This step will better assure that the safety net is not \nultimately called upon to bail them out in crisis .  \n \nConsistent with the first principle, banking organizations with access to the safety net should be \ngenerally confined to the following activities: commercial banking, underwriting securities and advisory \nservices, and asset and wealth  management services. Underwriting, advisory, and asset and wealth \nmanagement services are mostly fee- based services that do not put much of a firm’s capital at risk.  In \naddition, asset and wealth management services are similar to the trust services that have always been allowable for banks.  Restricting activities of banking organizations  \nIn contrast, banking organizations should be expressly prohi bited from activities that include  \ndealing and market -making, broke rage, and proprietary trading , which expose the safety net but have little  \nin common with core banking services.1\nThus, banking organizations would not be allowed to do trading, either proprietary or for \ncustomers, or make mar kets because such activity requires the ability to do trading.  In addition, allowing  Within the protection of the safety net, they create expansive \nrisks that are diffi cult to assess, monitor  or control.   \n                                                 \n1 This categorization of financial activities is from Matthew Richardson, Roy Smith and Ingo Walter in Chapter 7 of \nRegulating Wall Street: The Dodd- Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance , edited by Viral V. \nAcharya, Thomas F. Cooley, Matthew Richardson, Ingo Walter, New York University Stern School  of Business, \nJohn Wiley & Sons  Inc., 2010.  \n\n \n6 \n customer but not proprietary trading would make it easy to game the system by “concealing” proprietary \ntrading as part of the inventory necessary to conduct customer tradi ng. Also, prime brokerage services not \nonly require the ability to conduct trading act ivities  but also essentially allow companies to finance their \nactivities with highly unstable uninsured “deposits.”  This combination of factors , as we have recently \nwitne ssed, leads to unstable markets and government bailouts.  \nCritics of this proposal contend that  institutions grow to be large and complex because of \neconomies of scale and scope and they need the size and related complexit ies to be profitable and to \ncompete  globally . They believe firms must  have broad, mostly unrestricted access to all financial \nactivities to provide one -stop shopp ing and compete on a global basis . Arguments also are given  that \nlarge banks and securities firms are necessary to make efficient  markets for securities trading essential fo r \ncarrying out monetary policy.  \nThese arg uments are unconvincing  and, in fact,  mislead.  First, yes, it would be unfortunate if \nrestricting activities were to drive U.S. banks and jobs to other countries. However, w e have 200 years of \nbanking success in this country to refute that assertion.  More recently, under Glass -Steagall , U.S. banks \nand investm ent banks were highly competitive and successful as each specialized in lending to or \nunderwriting businesses all over the world. There is considerable evidence that under Glass- Steagall t he \nUnited States  was at no competitive disadvantage to Europe, with its mingled merchant banking system. \nThe United States  led the world —because it had strong, prudently run institutions that knew how to \nmanage money in the best interes ts of the client . \nSecond, there is no strong evidence of unlimited economies of scale an d even less for wide \neconomies of scope.  Although  both exist, they are captured at an asset size far less than that of SIFIs \ntoday. \nThird, large corporations would have ample convenient access to  commercial and traditional \ninvestment banking services insid e commercial banking . They would have to go to securities dealers to \npurchase swaps and other derivatives for hedging purposes, something that has been done in the past \nwithout difficulty.  \n\n \n7 \n Finally, it also seems improbable to me that any country should be willing or able to expand its \nsafet y net or to expose its taxpayers to the u ndefined risks of protecting ever -larger  and more complex \nbanking organizations. Instead , what countries should be focused on now is getting back to fundamentals \naimed at simplifying highly complex and unstable SIFIs. The focus should be on financial stability. \n  \nReforming the shadow banking system\nA legitimate concern of limiting the safety net is that this could worsen the risk of financial \ninstability by pushing activities to the unregulated shadow banking system.  Clearly, focusing solely on \nthe regulated banking industry and ignoring the unregulated shadow banking system would not solve the \nproblem and, in fact , might expand the shadow banking sector that was an integral part of the financial \ncrisis.    \nMuch of the instability in t he shadow banking system stems from its use of short -term funding for \nlonger -term investment.  The solution to this instability problem is not to provide a safety net for the \nshadow banks and regulate them more  but, i nstead, to remove exception s in which  money market \ninstruments are treated  essentially as deposits. The current exceptions  encourage significant short -term \nfunding of longer -term assets.  \nFirst, investors in money market mutual and other inv estment funds that are allowed to maintain a \nfixed net asset value of $1 have an incentive to run if they think their fund will “break the buck.” Thus, if \nthe fixed $1 net asset value is eliminated and the share values of such funds are required to float w ith their \nmarket values, shadow bank reliance on this source of short -term funding and the associated threat of \ndisruptive  runs would be greatly reduced.  \nSecond, the  potential disruptions to funding stemming from the repo financing of shadow banks  \nshould be ended. One of the sources of instability during the crisis was repo runs, particularly on repo borrowers using subprime mortgage -related assets as collateral.  Essentially, these borrowers funded long -\nterm assets of relatively low quality with very short -term liabilities.   \n\n \n8 \n These practices would be greatly  reduced by rolling back the bankruptcy law for repo collateral to \nthe pre -2005 rules. Prior to then, if a repo borrower defaulted, mortgage -related collateral could not be \nimmediately taken and sold by th e creditors. Returning to these  rules  would discourage the use of \nmortgage -related assets as repo collateral and reduce the potential for repo runs. Term lending through \nsecuritization would continue, probably at a smaller scale, with more closely matched term wholesale \nfunding provided by institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds  and life insurance \ncompanies.   \nThese changes to the rules for money market funds and repo instruments would increase the \nstability of the shadow banking system b ecause term lending outside the safety net would be less \ndependent on “demandable” funding and more reliant on term funding , and the pricing of risk would \nbetter reflect the actual risk incurred.  \n \nA final note: Implications for monetary p olicy  \nFinally, a s a member of  the Federal Open Market Committee, I realize that  we must consider  the \npotential effects of these proposals on the conduct of monetary policy. The impact could be significant \nbecause, as currently practiced, monetary policy operations are channeled through a limited number of counterpar ties called  primary dealers.  These dealers are required to participate in all auctions of U.S. \ngovernment debt and represent a key element in the implem entation of policy.  \nCurrently, there are only 20 primary dealers.  They are the largest financial firms operating in the \nUnited States , and most  are affiliated with commercial banks. I t is with this relationship that the changes I \npropose could affect the conduct of monetary policy. Specifically,  given that primary dealers could no \nlonger be affiliated with commercial b anks, would this inhibit market -making in securities, including \nTreasuries, and therefore interfere with the conduct of monetary policy?   \nThe answer is  “no.” I t is not necessary that primary dealers be affiliated with banks. It is only \nnecessary that they be institutions that deal in U.S. Treasuries and participate in auctions of U.S. \ngovernment debt.  Prior to the 1990s merger boom among investment banks and the Gramm -Leach -Bliley \n\n \n9 \n Act, it was typical that half or more of the primary dealers were not af filiated with commercial banks. \nTherefore, the fact that primary dealers are not commercial banks would  have little effect on the Federal \nReserve’s ability to conduct monetary  policy. \nI would add that al though  commercial banks could not be primary dealers, they could remain a \nkey part of the monetary policy mechanism. Recently , the Federal Reserve gained ex perience in using the \nTerm Auction Facility (TAF) . The TAF might very successfully be used in conjunction with primary \ndealer operations to conduct policy well into the future.   \n As you may recall, during the financial crisis, the TAF was an important comp onent of monetary \npolicy. For example, the TAF was introduced in December  2007 with an initial auction of $20 billion. \nThe facility was then ramped up  to almo st $500 billion by March  2009— about one -fourth of the assets on \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The maturity of TAF loans was generally 28 days or 84 days.   \nBy broadening the Federal Reserve’s monetary tools to include the TAF to provide term funds \nthrough the banking system in parallel with the primary dealers, we c ould greatly expand the number of \ncounterparties used in the conduct  of monetary policy. Thus, the TAF and primary dealers would provide \ndeep markets for the term portion of policy; prima ry dealers and traditional open- market operations would \ncontinue as the means for managing day-to-day operations and for maintaining the federal funds rate \nclose to the target.  With more counterparties, we enhance competition and ena ble nearly all banks to play \na role in th e conduct of monetary policy. This would make the larges t banks less “SI” and more “FI.”  \n \nConclusion  \nThe financial system has become far less competitive and far more volatile with the onset of \nsystemically important institutions.  Though large firms remain a critical part of our economic system in \nthe United States, they should not become so dominant that they become unaccountable to our capitalistic \nsystem.  We can make the necessary reforms to end the unique status of the SIFI and , in doing so, restore \nmuch of our global competitive vigor. Only from a position of financial stre ngth can the United States \nremain the global economic leader."

One reform effort, for \nexample, that is  especially difficult f or some interests to accept is the Volcker Rule. This rule  \nwill restrict banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading activities and involvement with hedge and private equity funds . It will affect the largest institutions most \ndirectly , confi ning their risk profile and limiting the advantages of leverage that currently drive  \nbehavior among these firms. How it is implemented will influence not only the behavior of these firms in the future but the discussion of other reform efforts yet to be undertaken .  \nI strongly support the Volcker Rule and suggest  it should be implemented with resolve  \nand should be strengthened in its reach and impact. Over the  next few minutes , I want to outlin e \nmy reason s for this position. Supporting my remarks this morning is a more extensive white \npaper prepared with colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City . \nThis paper  is posted \non our Bank’s website , www.KansasCityFed.org .  \n   \n\n3 \n A Brief History  \nA fundamental character istic of the United States is that its citizens have an  enormous \nsuspicion and distrust of concentrated power —political or financial . For nearly 200 years , state \nand f ederal laws placed limits  on bank activities and resource concentration, resulting in a  \nrelatively open U.S. banking system that has served the country  well. In fact , some of the largest \ninstitutions in this country  started small: The Bank of New York, for example, was founded, in \npart, by Alexander Hamilton , and the Mellon Bank was founded b y a farm boy who  built his \nown financial empire . Thousands of banks , from small community banks to large global players, \nhave operat ed in this co untry for most of our 200 years .  \nBanking in the United States thrived under the principl es of competition and \naccountability —as opposed to having a few mega -institutions with the power to allocate a \nmajority of financial resources and decide who wins and who loses. Rather, success followed a \nstructure in which thousands of banks operated;  competed ; and, in the end, helped build the \ngreatest  middle class the world has  known.  \nIn 1913, when the Federal Reserve was brought into existence, 21,000 commercial banks \noperated  across the country. At that time, the five largest banks c ontrolled assets that we estimate \nwere the equivalent of about 2.6 percent  of our gross domestic product  (GDP). As late as 1980, \nthe United States had 14,000 commercial banks, and the five largest controlled, in assets , the \nequivalent of about 14 percent  of GDP . Our nation had a  lightly concentrated and highly \ncompetitive commercial banking and financial system. W e saw the ascendancy of the United \nStates as the greatest economic system in the world. And we saw our country change from an agrari an-based economy  to a successf ul agriculture and i ndustrial complex. \n\n4 \n Today the U nited S tates has far fewer banks and a  highly concentrated financial industry. \nWe have fewer than 7,000 banks operating across the country . The five largest institutions \ncontrol  assets that are equivalent to  almost 60 percent  of GDP , and t he largest 20 institutions \ncontrol assets that are the equivalent of 86 percent  of GDP . The remaining  nearly 7,000 banks \ncontrol a ssets the equivalent of only 14 percent  of GDP.  More noteworthy perhaps is the fact that \nit was  several of the 20 largest institutions  that nearly brought down the U.S.  economy  during \nthis most recent global crisis .  \nWe did not get to such a circumstance b y accident or a Darwinian “ survival of the fittest”  \nprocess . We got there through policies that reflected good intentions  along the way, but \nultimately resulted in bad outcomes. Following earlier crises , such as  the 1907 Panic and the \nGreat Depression, we understandably  wanted a more resilient system that protected small \ndepositors . So, we first created the Federal Reserve and then the FDIC  to provide a safety net of \ncentral bank liquidity for solvent banks and limited deposit insurance.  \nDuring  the past 30 years, however, we have expanded the use of the safety net far beyond \nits origin al intent. During the crisis of the 1980s and early ’90s,  the government confirmed that \nsome institutions were too systemically important to fail—the largest institutions could put \nmoney anywhere , and its creditors would not be held accountable for the ris k taken. More \nstriking perhaps in the late 1990s, despite recent experience, Congress repealed the Glass -\nSteagall Act , which separated activities protected through the safety net from a host of other \nmore -highly risk- oriented and opaque  activities.  \nAs risks intensified and new crises emerged, this safety net was continually expanded to \nwhere the Federal Reserve, the  FDIC  and the Treasury were empowered to allocate enormous \nresources to ensure  systemically important institutions didn’t bring down the ec onomy. T his \n\n5 \n process inevitably led to the pick ing of winners and losers —not through competition and \nperformance, but through bureaucracy . The result is increased concentration  and, as just proven, \nless f inancial stability .  \nAlso, a s conditions allowed and incentives encouraged , complexity within the financial \nindustry expanded exponentially and so did industry risks . First, the expansion of the safety net \nenabled and encouraged banks  to increase their return on equity  by lowering capital levels and \nincreasing leverage. Second, w ith the elimination of Glass -Steagall , the largest institutions with \nthe greatest ability to lever age their balance sheets increased  their  risk profile by getting into  \ntrading, market making  and hedge fund activities , adding e ver greater complexity to their \nbalance sheets . Third, perception was reality , as certain complex institutions were bailed out and \ntherefore were in fact the safest  places for money  to go despite the risk . The market’s ability to \ndiscipline was mitigated , and these institutions became so complex that supervision could not \ncontrol their risk.  \nThe conclusion of this experience is  that the United States must reform its banking and \nfinancial structure  if we hope to have a competitive;  accountable;  and, in the  long run, less \nvolatile system. There are good reasons to expand the Volcker Rule and to narrow the scope of \nactivities for institutions operating under the public  safety net.  The consequence of expanding the \nsafety net to an ever-increasing range of activities is to invite a repeat of our  most recent crisis . \nYes, with separation  of activities , risks will remain in the financial system,  but unlike the past \ndecade, this risk will be  priced more correctly  and failure can be resolved  more equitably . \n \n  \n\n6 \n Proposal to Reduce Costs and Risks to the Safety Net and Financial System  \nLet me turn briefly to the reforms that I judge  necessary if we hope to more successfully \nmanage  the risks  and costs  to the safety net and financial system.  First, banking organizations \nthat have access to the safety net should be restricted to the core activities of making loans and \ntaking deposits and to other activities that do not significantly impede the market, bank management and bank supervisors in ass essing, monitoring and controlling bank risk- taking.  \nHowever, these actions alone  would provide limited benefits if the newly restricted  activities \nmigrate to shadow banks  without that sector also being reformed. Thus, we also will need to \naffect behavior within the shadow banking system through reforms of money market funds and \nthe repo market.   \n \nRestricting activities  of banking organizations  \nThe financial activities of commercial, investment and shadow banks can be categorized \ninto the following six groups1\n• Commercial banking: deposit -taking and lending to individuals and businesses . : \n• Investment banking:  underwriting securities (stocks and bonds) and advisory services . \n• Asset  and wealth management services:  managing assets for indivi duals and \ninstitutions . \n• Intermediatio n as dealers and market makers:  securities, repo  and over-the-counter \n(OTC) derivatives.  \n• Brokerage services:  retail, professional investors  and hedge funds (prime brokerage) . \n                                                           \n1 This categorization of financial activities is fro m Matthew Richardson, Roy Smith  and Ingo Walter in Chapter 7 of \nRegulating Wall Street: The  Dodd- Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance , edited by Viral V. \nAcharya, Thomas F. Cooley, Matthew Richardson, Ingo Walter, New York University Stern School of Business, \nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2010.  \n\n7 \n • Proprietary trading: trading for own account , internal hedge funds, private equity \nfunds, and holding unhe dged securities and derivatives.   \nBased on the criterion that permissible activities should not significantly impede the \nmarket, bank management  and the supervisory authorities  in assessing, mon itoring and \ncontrolling bank risk- taking, banking organizations should be allowed to conduct only the \nfollowing activities: commercial banking, underwriting securities and advisory services, and \nasset and wealth management services. Underwriting, advisory, and asset and wealth \nmanagement services are mostly fee -based services that do not put much of a firm’s capital at \nrisk. In addition, asset and wealth management services are similar to the trust services that have \nalways been allowable for banks.  \nIn cont rast, the other three categories of activities – dealing and market making, \nbrokerage, and proprietary trading – extend the safety net and yet do not have much in common \nwith core banking services . Within the protection of the safety net, t hey create risks  that are \ndifficult to assess, monitor  or control. Thus, banking organizations would not be allowed to do \ntrading, either proprietary or for customers, or make markets because such activity  requires the \nability to do trading.  In addition, allowing customer  but not proprietary trading would make it \neasy to game the system by “concealing” proprietary trading as part of the inventory necessary to conduct customer trading. Also, prime brokerage services not only require the ability to conduct trading activities , but also essentially allow companies to finance their activities with highly \nunstable uninsured “deposits.”  This combination of factors , as we have recently witnessed , leads \nto unstable markets and government bailouts. \nThe proposed activity restrictions will enable and  require  bank management to  focus  their \nactivities on the traditional banking business and manage  their  exposure to risks inherent in these \n\n8 \n activities.  Banking is based on a long -term customer relationship where the interests of the bank \nand customer are more aligned . Both the bank and loan customers benefit if borrowers do well \nand are able to pay off their loans.  In contrast, as shown only too clearly with this recent crisis, \ntrading is an adversarial zero -sum game – the trader’s gains are the losses of the counterpart y, \nwho is  oftent imes the customer . Also, for those firms with access to the safety net and large \namounts of credit, the advantage in the game goes to them. Thus, restricting these activities \nremoves a conflict of interest between a bank and its customers, which encourages a more stable financial  environment . \nIn addition, the inherent riskiness  of securities trading, dealing  and market -making \nattracts, and in fact r equires, people who are predisposed to taking short -term risks rather than \nlenders with a long -term outlook. The combination of securities and commercial banking \nactivities in a single organization provides opportunities for the senior management and boards of directors to be increasingly influenced by individuals with a short -term perspective.  As a \nresult, the increased propensity of these corporate leaders to take high risks for short -term gain  \nleads to more of a short -term-returns culture throughout the organization. \nHistorically, bank investments were restricted to loan s and investments in investment -\ngrade securities.  As demonstrated in the financial crisis, the complexity of many asset -backed \nsecurities made it very difficult to determine their credit q uality.  As a result, “complicated” \nmultilayer structured securities should be treated as other non- investment -grade assets  are, and \ncommercial banks should be limited or prohibited from holding them.  \nCritics of restricting activities have raised concerns t hat it would cause problems for U.S. \nbanks because they would face a competitive disadvantage relative to universal banks that are allowed to conduct the full range of activities. They say it would drive U.S. banks and jobs to \n\n9 \n other countries. If this were  accurate, it would be an unfortunate outcome, certainly. However , \nthis conclusion should be considered carefully before it is accepted. First, we have 200 years of \nbanking success in this country that tends to refute that assertion. Second , it seems improbable \nthat any other countr y should be willing or able to expand its safety net to new large and \ncomplex banking organizations. Third, a nd finally , the U.S. a uthorities  should consider carefully \nwhether it is wise to insure and therefore  protect  credi tors of foreign  organizations that operate in \nthis country outside of the U.S.’s  prudential standards.  \n \nReforming the shadow banking system   \nCritics of restricting the activities of banking organizations also argue that it could \nworsen the risk of financial instability by pushing even more activities to the unregulated shadow \nbanking system. I agree that focusing solely on the  regulated bank ing industry  would not solve \nthe problem and might in  fact expand the shadow banking  sector that was an integr al part of the \nfinancial crisis.  \nHowever, m uch of the instability in the shadow banking system stemmed from its use of \nshort -term funding for longer -term investment.  This source of systemic risk can be significantly \nreduced by making two changes to the money market.  \nThe first change addresses potential disruptions coming from money market funding of \nshadow banks – money market mutual funds and other investment s that are allowed to maintain \na fixed net asset value of $1 should be required to have floating ne t asset values. Shadow banks’  \nreliance on this source of short -term funding and the associated threat of disruptive runs would \nbe greatly reduced by eliminating the fixed $1 net asset value and requiring share values to float \nwith their market values.  \n\n10 \n The second recommendation addresses potential disruptions stemming from the short -\nterm repurchase agreement, or repo, financing of shadow banks. Under bankruptcy law, repo \nlenders receive special treatment as compared to other secured lenders because they are allowed to take possession of the underlying collateral if the borrower defaults. In other words, repo \nlenders are not subject to the automatic stay that all other creditors are subject to when default occurs.  The bankruptcy law also specifies the eligible  assets for the automatic stay exemption.  \nOne of the changes in the 2005 bankruptcy reform law was to make mortgage -related \nassets used in repo transactions exempt from the automatic stay.  Prior to 2005, only very safe \nsecurities were exempt from this  stay. The change meant that all of the complicated and often \nrisky mortgage securities could be used as repo collateral just when the securities were growing rapidly and just prior to the bursting of the housing price bubble. One of the sources of instability during the crisis was repo runs, particularly on repo borrowers using subprime mortgage -related \nassets as collateral.  Essentially, these borrowers funded long- term assets of relatively low quality \nwith very short -term liabilities.   \nTherefore,  to improve the stability of the shadow banking market , the bankruptcy law for \nrepo collateral should be rolled back to the pre -2005 rules and eliminate the automatic stay \nexemption for mortgage -related repo collateral . This would discourage such activity and tend to \nreduce the potential instability that is associated with repo  runs . Term wholesale funding would \ncontinue to be provided by institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds  and life \ninsurance companies.   \nOverall, these changes to the rules for money market funds and repo instruments would \nincrease the stability of the shadow banking system because term lending would be less \n\n11 \n dependent on “demandable” funding and more reliant on term funding , and the pricing of  risk \nwould reflect the actual risk incurred .  \n \nConclusion  \nThe proposal I am placing before you today will not take all risks out of the f inancial \nsystem.  Reasonable r isk is, in fact, part of the financial system and essential to our economic \nsuccess . However, t he proposal will  improve the  stability of the financial system by clarifying  \nwhere risk s reside;  improv ing the pricing of risk; and, thus, enhancing the allocation of resources \nwithin our economic system. It also will promote a more competitive f inancial system , as it \nlevel s the playing field for all financial institutions.  And finally, it will raise the bar of \naccountability for actions taken and, to an important degree , reduce the likelihood of future \nbailouts funded by  the American taxpayer s."

Unprecedented steps have been taken to restore stability to the world \neconomy and, just as importantly, to assure a sustained recovery. I certainly support  these goals. \nWhile I argued for handling  the l argest financial institutions differently than was done, I \nsupported the  Federal Reserve’s massive  liquidity injections  designed  to stau nch the financial \ncrisis . After all, central banks exist  in part for just that purpose . However, when the crisis is past, \nit is incumbent upon central banks to return to another of their responsibilities : creating \nconditions for a sustained economic recovery that requires looking  beyond short -term goals  to \nlong-term consequences .      \n For more than a year, I have advocat ed, not for a tight U.S. monetary policy , but for one  \nthat would begin unwind ing those  policies put in place during the  crisis . In January 2010, as the \nrecovery entered its third quarter, I expressed the view that the Federal Open Market Committee \nshould modify its rate guarantee to the market. That is, while agreeing that policy sh ould remain \naccommodative, I voted against promising “ exceptionally low rates for an extended period .” As \nthe recovery continued  into the spring , I judged that the Federal Reserve should gradually shrink \nits enlarged  balance sheet with  minimal market disruption by disposing of mortgage -backed \nsecurities that  were trading in the market at  a premium. Thus, I  voted against replacing maturing \nMBSs with  similar or other securities. Finally, i n the fall, I questioned the long -term benefits of \nfurther easing monet ary policy during a recovery  – and  I voted against QE2 .  \nToday, my view has not changed.  T he FOMC should gradually allow its $3 trillion \nbalance sheet to shrink  toward  its pr e-crisis level of $1 trillion. It should move  the U.S. federal \nfunds  rate off of zero and toward 1 percent within a fairly short  period of time. T hen, after \n\nevaluating  the effects of those actions , it should be prepared to  move the funds  rate further \ntoward a level that could be reasonably judged as closer to normal and sustainable.   \n I recognize that these actions are not simple to implement. They would impact different \neconomic sectors differently and to  varying degrees .  They involve trade offs in their effects  and \nuncertainty about the short -term reactions of financial markets and the real economy .  However,  \nthey are not unreasonable or radical  or inconsistent with our experience in dealing with past \ncrises . They are focus ed on the long er run – refle cting a sharp awareness that policy geared  too \nlong toward extensive accommodation undermine s market discipline and e ncourages speculative \nactivities. Put another way, t hese actions  reflect the  view  that the longer exceptionally \naccommodative monetary  policies  remain in place , the greater the danger that resources  will be \nmisallocated within and across  world economies .   \n Given the wide differences in views around the se issues, I want to take time this evening \nto share my perspective on  U.S. monetary  policy choices and their  effects  on economic and \nfinancial  outcomes . \n \nRecovery is Under Way  \n The financial crisis is over , and the U.S. econom y is recovering.  GDP growth in the \nUnited States  averaged 3.0 percent from  the third quarter of 2009 through the fourth quarter of \n2010.  And it is worth noting that for the same period, the International Monetary Fund estimates \nthat global GDP growth averaged 4.9 percent . Also, the U nited States  added 1.5 million  jobs into \nthe private sector  over the one -year period ending in February of this year . Other parts of the \nworld, especially Asia, have experienced particularly strong  growth.   While p arts of Europe and \n\nthe U.K.  have grown less robustly , the fact remains that the U.S. and much of the  world is \nexperiencing sustained economic growth.   \n With the United States  and many  world econom ies experiencing such  growth and with  \nthe U.S. financial crisis over , I would expect to see a change in policy in which stimulus put in \nplace at the height of the crisis would be throttled back.  However, this change in policy is on \nhold in the U nited States.  The reason for the delay is the existence o f significant productive \ncapacity that remains unused  in many of the developed nations. While the U.S. economy has \nclearly strengthened, it has  not yet returned to pre -crisis output and employment lev els.  Its \nunemployment rate, for example, re mains near 9 percent.   In the U.K., unemployment remain s \nnear 8 percent . Thus for many the issue of policy turns on one ’s confidence in the long run \neconomic trends and the degree of monetary accommodation needed to e nsure that those trends \ncontinue.   \n \nShifting Economic Risks     \nThe monetary policy being implemented currently within the United States  and much of \nthe world is more accommodative now than  at the height of the crisis. Policy interest rates \nremain zero , and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet continues to expand even as the economy \nimproves. With these actions, th e FOMC’s objectives  have shifted from that of containing a \nglobal crisis to that of more quickly accelerating economic growth. Its components focus on raising inflation expectations, i ncreasing  asset values  and pushing up growth in aggregate \ndemand, and, as stated in its September 2010 press release, emplo yment. While I agree these are \nworthy  goals, I am concerned that maintaining a crisis- oriented policy as the tool to achieve them \n\nsignificantly changes  the economic risks . Past  success in pursuing this form of policy is  mixed at \nbest. \n  \nCentral Banks and the Long Run  \n A Swiss central banker once advised  me that the duty of a central banker  is to take care of \nthe long run so the short  run can take care of itself . In the United States, this simple expression \nhas been codif ied in its laws. T he Federal Res erve Act requires that, “The … Federal Open \nMarket Committee shall maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit aggregate s \ncommensurate with the economy’ s long- run potential to increase production, so as to promote \neffectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moder ate long -term interest \nrates.”  \n These mandates recognize that the factors of production come t ogether in a systematic \nfashion across economies, sector s within economies and re source availability to create growth. \nThe process is not simple nor does it occur quickly  – which  is the purpose of putting policy in \nthe context of the long run.  It is within this context that policy should acknowledge the \nimproving economic trends and begin to withdraw some degree of accommodation. If this is not  \ndone , then the risk  of in troduc ing new imbalances and long -term inflation ary pressures into an \nalready fragile recovery  increase significantly . \n \nShort -Run Actions Have Consequences  \n In the spring of 2003 there was worldwide concern  that the U.S. economy was falling \ninto a “Japanese- like” malaise; the recovery was stallin g, deflation was likely to occur  and \nunemployment was too high. This was the prevailing view  despite the fact that t he U.S. economy \n\nwas growing at a 3.2 percent annual rate and the global economy’s average growth was nearly \n3.6 percent. In addition, t he fed f unds policy rate was 1 ¼ percent . Although most knew that such \na low rate would s upport an expanding economy, i n June 2003 it was lowered further to 1 \npercent  and was left at th at rate for nearly a year,  as insurance.  \n Following this  action , the United St ates and the worl d began an extended  credit \nexpansion and housing boom . From July 2003 to July 2006, the monetary base in the United \nStates  increased at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent , credit increased at an annual  rate of 9 \npercent , and housing prices increased at an annual rate of about 14 percent . The long- term \nconsequences of that  policy  are now well known. The United States  and the world have just \nsuffered one of the worst recessions in decades.  \n The crisis has sometimes been described as  a “perfect s torm” of unfortunate events  that \nsomehow came together and  systematically undermined the financial system . Such events  \nincluded, for example, weak supervision and a misguided n ational housing policy . While these \nfactors certainly contributed to the severity of the crisis,  monetary policy cannot escape its role \nas a primary contributing factor.      \n In reviewing data from this and earlier econo mic crises, the fact is that extended periods \nof accommodative policies are almost inevitably followed by  some combination of ballooning \nasset prices and increasing infla tion. I recently compared the movement of real policy interest \nrates and inflation for four countries: the United States , the U.K., Germany  and Korea fro m 1960 \nto the present (Chart 1). The relationship between negative rates and high inflation is \nunmistakable . Also, the relationship between negative rates and housing price busts in advanced \neconomies since 1970 is instructive . In this instance , nea rly 50 percent of the housing price busts \nwere preceded by negative real policy rates in the years before the busts (Chart 2). If a housing \n\nbust is thought of as a tail -risk event, these percentages are too high .  Thus, it is also worth \nnoting that a s of this month, the U.S. real federal f unds rate has been negative for 11 quarters.  \n These relationships,  of course , must be tested more vigorously before final  conclusions \nare drawn ; but t he data are strongly suggestive  and the findings consistent with those of  schol ars \nsuch as Allan Meltzer. E xtended periods of  accommodative policy, pursued to enhance  short -\nterm economic  growth , are often highly disruptive in their economic effects . After the easing  \nactions of 2003, unemployment declined  from 6. 3 percent in June 2003 to 5 percent two years \nlater and to 4.6 percent the following year. However,  by late  2009, following the worst of the  \ncredit crisis,  the unemployment rate was  more than 10 percent.    \n \nThe Future  \n As in 2003, concerns were voiced this past year  that the U.S. economy  was facing the \nprospect of  deflation, slow growth and high unemployment.  This was the case despite the many \nactions  world economies had taken  to remedy the crisis  and stimulate growth .   For me , it was \ndifficult to conclude that more monetary expansion w ould assure a sustained recovery, and  while \nthere may be events that may slow  economi c growth , those events are related to other real \nfactors .   \n   As the U nited States  continues to ease policy into its recovery, once again t here are \nsigns that the world is  building  new  economic  imbalances  and inf lationary impulses . I would \nsuggest also that the longer policy remains as it is , the greater the likelihood these pressures will \nbuild and ultimately undermine world growth .  In the United States , for example, with very low \ninterest rates, we are beginning to see some assets accelerating in price. Agricultural  land  prices, \nfor example,  are increasing at double -digit rates. High -yield securities in financial markets are \n\ndemanding price premiums bey ond what some would judge reasonable relative to risk. Why? To \nquote a mar ket participant, “W hat are my choices ?” \n The world for some time now has been experiencing rapidly  rising commodity prices .  \nWhile some of the increase may reflect global supply and demand conditions, at least some of \nthe increase is driven by highly  accommodative monetary policies in the U nited States  and other \neconomies.  An d, more recently , in the U nited States  there is  evide nce of  accelerating  increases \nin core price s. Over the past four months , core PCE inflation in the United States  has increased \nfrom a modest rate of 0.7 percent to a rate of 1.5 percent . I understand the U.K. also is \nexperiencing rising prices.  W hile no one can say with certainty whether this will continue, \nevidence is mounting that it might.      I conclude  my remarks this evening with the following  observation. I tracked  the average \ngrowth of money and the price level s in the United States from the 19\nth century to the present \n(Chart 3).  It should surprise no one that t here is a striking parallel between the long -run growth \nof money and the growth in the price- level index. From the end of World War II  alone, the price \nindex has incr eased by a factor of ten . With such a track record , it is hard to accept that defl ation \nshould be the world’s  dominant  concern.  \n \nConclusion  \n Central bank ers must look to the long run. If current  policy remains in place , we almost \ncertainly will stimulate the growth of asset v alues and inflation. This may temporarily  increase \nGDP and employment, but in the long run, we risk instability, damaging inflation and lost jobs , \nwhich is a dear price for middle and lower income citizens to pay . \n\n However, t he long run is not yet here . We have oppor tunities to assure greater long- term \nstability. Moving policy from highly accommodative to merely accommodative would be a step \nin the right direction. In this way, we can achieve a better long -run outcome than if we delay \nnormalization."

Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nbefore the  \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry  \nUnited States Senate  \n \nFebruary 17, 2011  \n  \n\n1 \n  \nThank you, Madam Chair.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss recent developments in \nU.S. agriculture and its role in the U.S. economy.  Agriculture remains a vital industry in the \nexpansive region that the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City serves and, accordingly, our Bank has a long tradition of focusing significant  attention on industry developments.  Our \nobservations on agriculture, in turn, ha ve given us useful insight into the U.S. and global \neconomies more broadly.  In my remarks this morning, I ’ll describe recent developments in the \nnation’s farm economy and discuss some risks that ha ve my attention.  \n \nRecent Developments in U.S. Agriculture \nAgriculture – broadly defined as farm production and output from related industries – \naccounts for almost one -sixth of U.S. jobs and economic activity.  While the farm share of \neconomic output has declined as other parts of our economy have grown, increased activity in \nbroader agricultural industries  – manufacturing, transportation, distribution and food retai ling – \nhas opened new job opportunities in both rural and metro communities.  \n A robust agricultural sector cushioned the rural economy in our and other regions across \nthe nation during the recent recession, and the industry’s strength is supporting furthe r \nimprovement in the rural economy today.  In 2010, strong demand and tight supplies for most farm commodities contributed to a sharp rebound in farm profits, which then supported sales in farm equipment and other farm -based industries.  Strong profits from agriculture also girded \nimportant elements of our rural financial system.  Commercial banks with large agricultural loan portfolios posted stronger returns than their peers over the past three  years.  While more than 300 \ncommercial banks failed during this time, only 22 were agricultural banks.  \n\n2 \n Agriculture is also benefitting directly from the rebounding economic strength of China \nand other emerging market economies, where rapid income growth is driving up food demand.  \nThe United States  remains a net exp orter of agricultural products, shipping more than 40 percent \nof its wheat, cotton, soybeans and rice crops to f oreign countries in 2010.   United States  crop \nand meat exports are expected to rise to record highs in 2011.  Looking out a little further, economists expect global growth to exceed 4 percent well into 2012, with the developing and \nemerging market economies remaining in the lead.  Rapid income gains in the developing world promise further increases in demand for higher -protein diets.  \n \nDeveloping Risks in Agriculture  \n Despite prospects of sustained farm income growth, U.S. producers must remain alert as \nthey face challenges related to their very success and tied to recent developments in financial \nmarkets.  Surging commodity prices and low interest rates have translated  into increasing \nfarmland values, which have eclipsed  their 1980s peaks.  In our Bank's fourth quarter 2010 \nSurvey of A gricultural C redit C onditions, for example, cropland values in Nebraska and Kansas \nwere nearly 20 percent above year -ago levels and more than 75 percent higher than five years \nago.   \nThis run- up in farmland values has occurred, however, amid financial markets \ncharacterized by high levels of liquidity and unusually low interest rates.  History has taught us that it is nearly impossible to de termine how much of the farmland boom may be an \nunsustainable bubble driven by financial markets and how much results from fundamental changes in demand and supply conditions.  Therefore, it will surprise no one when I say we are \n\n3 \n watching the market closel y, just as we are watching for imbalances emerging elsewhere in the \neconomy.  \nOf particular interest to me is how agriculture might adjust when financial markets return \nto more -normal interest rate conditions.   Rising interest rates often coincide with falling farm \nrevenues and higher capitalization rates, a depressing combination for farmland values.   \nMoreover, even if crop prices remain high but capitalization rates return to their historic  average, \nfarmland values could fall by as much as a third, which most certainly would erode the financial health of the farm sector.  \nFortunately, the industry entered this period with a relatively strong balance sheet.  Farm \nleverage ratios are at historic lows, and agricultural banks are well capitalized.  In addition, farm \noperators and banks have strengthened their risk- management practices, using basic hedging \nstrategies and derivative markets to manage price and balance sheet risk , which contributed to \nsmaller increases in problem assets at agricultural banks than  at their peers.   Nevertheless, I \nfollow the basic lesson that bad loans are made in good times , and I remain watchful.  \nIn closing, I’ll briefly highlight a symposium the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nhosted last summer to consider agriculture's response to the extraordinary shifts occurring in market conditions. There was a marked and, in my view, a very healthy consensus that the industry’s success will lie not in its ability to follow a single path, but in its ability to adapt quickly to shifting e conomic landscapes and conditions.  Still, my nagging concern remains that \ncurrent distortions in financial markets are increasing the risk that imbalances in asset markets will catch agriculture – and the U.S. economy more generally – by surprise once aga in. \nThank you Madam Chair. \n\n4 \n M E M O R A N D U M \nJanuary 14, 2011  \n \nTo:  Thomas Hoenig, Esther George, Diane Raley, Alan Barkema, Kevin Moore  \nFrom:  Jason Henderson and Brian Briggeman \nSubject:  Farmland Values and Interest Rate Risk  \n \nHigher crop prices and lower interest rates have fueled a surge in farmland values, raising \nconcerns about a bubble in the agricultural real estate market. Since June, grain prices have doubled, \nand futures markets suggest that prices could remain elevated through 2014. Still, h istorically low \ninterest rates and capitalization rates are needed to justify current farmland values.  \n \nOver the past year, farmland values have posted double -digit gains, with additional gains \nexpected in 2011 (Map 1). By the beginning of 2010, U.S. farml and values had risen more than 15 \npercent above 2005 levels, lifting the total value of U.S. farmland to almost $2 trillion (Chart 1). \nWhile farmers own the majority of U.S. farmland, non-farm investors are buying more land. \nAccording to a 2010 Iowa State University report, investors accounted for a quarter of Iowa farmland \nsales.  \n \nLow interest rates, which have depressed capitalization rates, contributed to the recent spike \nin farmland values. Capitalization rates on U.S. farmland have fluctuated over time , falling in periods \nof negative real interest rates – 1970s and 2000s – and rising during periods of higher real interest \nrates – 1980s. According to USDA data, Nebraska’s capitalization rate on cropland was 5.1 percent \nat the beginning of 2010, well below its historical average of 7.5 percent (Chart 2). Despite regional variation, capitalization rates on farmland values have fallen to record lows across the nation, with \nrates below 5 percent in most states (Map 2). Oklahoma and Texas have lower capitaliza tion rates \ndue to mineral rights inflating farmland values.  \n \nGiven low capitalization rates, farmland values face significant interest rate risk. For \nexample, irrigated cropland in eastern Nebraska is valued at $5,000 per acre. A historically low \ncapitaliz ation rate of 5 percent is needed to rationalize this land value at current corn prices and \nyields (Table 1). If interest rates would rise and lift capitalization rates to their historical average of \n7.5 percent, the capitalized value of irrigated farmland in eastern Nebraska could fall by a third to $3,300 per acre (Chart 3). If capitalization rates would rise to 10 percent as they did during the 1980s \nfarm crisis, land values could drop by half. Additional analysis suggests that other regions face \nsimilar  interest rate risks.  \n Rising interest rates could also cut farmland values by reducing farm revenues. Higher \ninterest rates tend to raise exchange rates, which limits agricultural exports, in turn depressing \ncommodity prices and farm revenues. In 1981, t he spike in real interest rates led to higher exchange \nrates and contributed to lower agricultural exports. With falling exports, commodity prices and farm \nrevenues dropped, which pushed farmland values to their 1985 lows. If a similar event occurred \ntoday , farmland values could fall. For example, if capitalization rates return to their historical average \nand corn prices drop to $4 per bushel, their 2009 average, irrigated land values in eastern Nebraska \ncould fall almost 50 percent to $2,700 per acre (Chart 4). Other regions face similar risks. In sum, \nrising interest rates could trigger a sharp decline in farmland values.  \n\n5 \n Map 1:  \nNon-irrigated Cropland Values  \n(Percent change 2009:Q3 to 2010:Q3)  \n \n \n \n \nChart 1:  \nReal U.S. Farmland Values  Source:  Federal Reserve District Surveys \n(Chicago , Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas)Kansas/W.

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n      \n \n            \nNational Association of Realtors Conference \nNew Orleans, La. \nNovember 5, 2010 \n   \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessa rily reflect those of the Fede ral Reserve System, its governors , \nofficers or representatives.\n\n \nIntroduction \nMy position on the current stance of our  nation’s monetary policy is well known, \nespecially to those who closely follow the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market \nCommittee has met seven times this year, and at each of those meetings I have cast a dissenting \nvote against the majority opinion of keeping the federal funds rate target at  its current level near \nzero for an “extended period.” \nI realize that advocating an interest rate in crease is not the best  applause line at a \nRealtors’ conference. However, I believe that moving rates modestly off of zero, where they \nhave been since December 2008, still represents highly accommodative monetary policy. More \nimportantly, such action is necessary if we are to  ensure a more stable economy that can thereby \nfoster a more sustainable housing market.   \nHow Can We Revive Housing? \nWe have all suffered through the worst colla pse in housing prices since the 1930s, and \nthe situation we face will not be easily corrected. \nThe housing collapse can be characterized as a classic asset-price bubble spurred by low \ninterest rates, easily accessible and often-unsound  financing, over-optimism about housing price \ntrends, and a high—and difficult to control—leve l of subsidies that flowed into housing. \nAlthough we may have experienced a few excepti onal years of housing activity, those years do \nnot come close to making up for the economic r ecession, foreclosures, erased wealth and slow \nrecovery that we now are experiencing. \n2 \n \n\nGiven this experience, the question that now confronts us is, “What can we do to create \nmore stable housing markets and lessen the boom -bust cycles in housing?” These cycles have \nunfortunately become all too familiar over the past few decades.  \nSome argue that our housing and mortgage mark ets will not recover in a timely fashion \nwithout extensive public support.  Among the suggested solutions are expanding Federal Housing \nAdministration lending and the role of the Fede ral Home Loan Banks and allocating whatever \nfunds are needed to bring the tw o housing agencies, Fannie Mae a nd Freddie Mac, back to their \npre-crisis role for housing. Other ideas include a renewal of tax credits for home purchases and \nmore extensive programs for mortgage restructur ings. From the Federal Reserve, some want a \ncontinuation of near-zero interest rates for an extended period and greater investments in \nmortgage instruments. \nIn sharp contrast to that vi ew, others suggest that the fi nancial crisis has exposed a \nnumber of critical flaws in our housing policie s and mortgage finance system that call for a \nsignificant “re-look” at how we finance this industry. For inst ance, Paul Volcker, who was \nchairman of the Federal Reserve during a porti on of the 1980s real estate crisis, recently \ndescribed the U.S. mortgage indus try as “dysfunctional” and a “creature of the government” that \nneeds reform.  \nThe options seem to fall out to either re building a system backed by extensive public \nsupport, subsidies and other prot ections, or build a new framework that returns housing finance \nto greater reliance on private market forces.  \nI support a policy path that re turns the housing industry toward  greater market discipline \nand greater long-run stab ility. This path requires a great ly reduced role for governmental \nintervention and public subsidies that have di storted the market over recent decades. The \n3 \n \n\nAmerican public, including as piring homeowners and those of you employed in the housing \nindustry, might be best served, over time, by reduci ng or removing these subsidies as part of our \nnational policy. \nThere are several factors that argue for making such a change in policy. First, the crisis \nclearly shows that a mortgage finance sy stem based on expanding the incentives and \nopportunities to take on more debt with little equity places hous eholds at significant financial \nrisk and creates unsustainable trends in housing expansion.  \nSecond, such policies create harmful distor tions within the economy, and they are \nenormously expensive in terms of both their e xplicit and implicit costs, to both taxpayers and \nhomeowners, especially when things go badly. Many of the subsidies directed toward housing \nhave been extremely inefficient, with other par ties capturing most of the benefits rather than \nhomeowners. \nMoreover, with the growing federal budget defi cits and the many interests that will be \nintensely competing for public funds, it is unrealis tic to expect that all can be accommodated or \nthat housing can continue to command the same portion of public funds and levels of taxpayer \nsupport and exposure. In brief, housing policy is  badly flawed, and today’s budget environment \nrequires reform. \n \nFix Freddie and Fannie \nWhat specific steps should we take? The first and most obvious step is to reform the two \nhousing finance vehicles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two institutions were \nresponsible for more than half of all U.S. mortgages passed thr ough the system at the height of \nthe housing boom. These government-sponsored enterprises were assigned goals around \n4 \n \n\naffordable housing that contributed dramatically to the growth in subprime credit and the decline \nin lending standards that led to the crisis. Fannie and Freddie clearly  fit the pattern of what Paul \nVolcker said we must avoid: “Private when things are going well and public when things are \ngoing badly.”  \nSeveral studies have found that the vari ous subsidies received by Fannie and Freddie \nhave done little to lower mortgage rates. Instead, the vast majority  of such benefits accrued to \nFannie and Freddie’s stockholders or was used to gain political  favor. For example, only two \nmonths before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were  put into conservatorship in September 2008, \nmedia accounts detailed how both had made the list of Washington’s top 10 lobbying spenders \nover the previous decade. Together, they had spent a total of $170 million.1 At that time, Fannie \nemployed 51 lobbyists and Freddie paid 91, with  both counting former members of Congress \namong their hired guns. This was only two years af ter the Federal Election Commission levied a \n$3.8 million penalty against Freddie related to char ges it was illegally involved in 85 political \nfundraisers.  \nConsidering the high level of political activ ism on the part of these GSEs, it should not \nsurprise you to learn that both Fannie and Freddie are considered “heavy hitters” on the Center for Responsive Politics’ website, OpenSecrets.or g, which provides a wide range of data on \nmoney’s influence on U.S. elections and policy. Th at designation means that both are among the \nbiggest donors to federal-level politics since 1989.  \nSo, while Fannie and Freddie have spent m illions on lobbying and building influence in \nWashington, their losses could cost taxpayers as much as $363 billion, according to recent \nestimates—and those are just the direct losses. Th e overall losses that could be attributed to the \nGSEs are likely to be several multiples higher when we consider that without their implied \n                                                \n \n1 USA Today, July 17, 2008. \n5 \n \n\n“federal guarantee” and related incentives around ris k, the markets might have been far more \ncautious and the financial crisis far less prolific . More stunning perhaps, had these institutions \nbeen held to stricter financial standards, far fewer households would have suffered the tragedy of \nforeclosures, the lost home equity and the lo ss of personal savings a nd wealth that today \ncontinues to hold back our economic recovery.   \nGiven the costs and market distortions these government-supported institutions brought \nwith them, we should be confident that they shou ld not be allowed to operate in the future as \nthey have in the past. We cannot afford to igno re that through their us e of implicit government \nfunding guarantees, they held a significant compet itive advantage in the marketplace, and that \nthis in turn encouraged excessive risk on their balance sheets, w ith tragic outcomes. \n Given past errors, how might we approach the need for some modest support for future \nfinancing within the housing indus try? I see two basic options. \nFirst, if we judge that some public support is  needed, we could esta blish public  entities \nthat focus solely on the secu ritization of conventional, c onforming mortgages with strong \nunderwriting standards, tight public oversight and balance sheets limited to holding amounts \nnecessary for warehousing loans to be securiti zed. This makes the government a conduit only, \nfacilitating the flow of capital but not providi ng the implicit guarantees on funding and assets \nheld that contributed to this cr isis. The market remains the fina l arbiter of standards and funding. \nA second option would be to give private en tities sole authority to securitize pools of \nconforming mortgages—similar to what is now done  with jumbo mortgages. If the Congress was \ndisposed to provide some favor to housing, a federal guarantee could be given to certain \nsecurities backed by mortgages meeting strict co nforming loan standards. However, such favored \nstatus should be based on some limiting factor, such as need or special purpose.  \n6 \n \n\nEither of these two options would address many of the problems associated with Fannie \nand Freddie in this crisis and would create a mo re transparent and competitive marketplace. The \nlatter option involving privately owned entities would offer the a dditional benefits of greater \nmarket discipline and insulation from political influence and control.  \n \nEnforce Sound Lending Standards  \nRegardless of these actions, we must as a nati on insist on the return to sound real estate \nlending standards. We know today that countries th at avoided the worst of this most recent real \nestate meltdown did a better and more consistent job in maintaining an effective and consistent \nset of standards for loan-to-value and debt-to-in come ratios. Some count ries, such as Canada, \neven tightened mortgage lending requirements when  real estate markets heated up. In the United \nStates, the oppos ite occurred. \nWhile sound credit standards are a key respons ibility of individual lenders, public policy \nalso played an important role in the deteriora tion of loan quality in the United States. This \noccurred largely through public efforts to prom ote and subsidize homeownership and increase \naccess to housing credit. During the crisis, politic ians, regulators and market participants were \nsingled out for blame. In reality, it was a group effort. \n In the years leading to this most recent crisis, a common theme emerged at all levels: \nHouseholds can accommodate more debt relative to income. A report titled The 1994 National \nHomeownership Strategy: Partners in the American Dream  stated: “Financing strategies fueled \nby the creativity and resources of the private and public sect ors should address…financial \nbarriers to homeownership [and]…reduce downpa yment requirements and interest costs by \nmaking terms more flexible.” In other word s, the key to homeownership from a political \n7 \n \n\nperspective is to promote more creative and flexib le lending standards, or  what, in hindsight, we \nmight more correctly call high leverage. \nThis political desire for creative and flex ible lending was hardly new in 1994, though. It \nwas also a central fixture in the real estate collapse of the 1980s. A Senate report on a 1982 \nlegislative provision to remove national bank loan-t o-value limits on real estate lending provides \na powerful insight into the causes of financial cris es. According to this re port, the purpose of the \nlegislative change was “to provide national banks with the ability to engage in more creative and \nflexible financing, and to become stronger pa rticipants in the home financing market.” \nAlthough creative and flexible financing mi ght remain a goal in housing, sound lending \nstandards cannot be ignored if we are to have sustainable housing growth. With this in mind, the \nFederal Reserve in 2008 revised rules implemen ting the Home Ownership and Equity Protection \nAct. These rules simply prohibit lenders from  making loans without co nsidering a borrower’s \nability to repay the loan from income and asse ts other than a home’s value. Who would have \nthought it necessary to write rules that  are otherwise nothing but common sense? \nWe should also take a closer look at the loan-to-value guidelines that depository \ninstitutions are required to follow in making real estate loans. We should review guidelines to \nensure they are adequate, and we should apply them equitably to other lenders. Other lending \nprovisions, subsidies and public policies directed toward the housing sector and home financing \nalso need to be examined. These would incl ude the risk weights for mortgage loans and \nmortgage-backed securities under th e Basel capital requir ements, state and federal tax deductions \nfor mortgage interest, reliance on credit rati ng agencies’ assessments  of mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and the wide variety of other public policies related to housing. Given current housing \n8 \n \n\nconditions and the way a number of subsidies have become embedded in our housing system, \nsome policy reforms would have to be phased in  gradually and after ma rkets have recovered.  \nA key point in reviewing U.S.  housing finance policies should  be to consider whether \nthey encourage homeownership in a cost-eff ective manner without put ting homeowners at \nunacceptably high financial risk. The 2005 Presiden t’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, \nfor instance, concluded that the federal tax deduction for mortgage interest provided an \n“incentive to take on more debt,” involved large subsidies that encouraged “overinvestment in \nhousing” and was “not shared equally among a ll taxpayers,” with higher-income households \nreceiving “a disproportionate be nefit.” Accordingly, the panel recommended replacing the \ndeductions with tax credits and placing a cap on the benefits as a means of distributing the \nbenefits more evenly and limiting the incentive s to take on excessive  amounts of debt.  \nWith regard to promoting housing through in terest rate policies, I have many times \npublicly expressed my views about the dangers  of using monetary tools and the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet to pursue low interest rates and fund mortgage-b acked securities. The \nonly additional point that I would repeat is that  for home financing to follow a path that is \nsustainable over time, the Federal Open Market  Committee must begin ta king steps to normalize \nmonetary policy. \n \nConclusion \nEconomists Hyman Minsky, Charles Kindleberge r, and, more recently, Carmen Reinhart \nand Kenneth Rogoff have all writ ten extensively about how high credit growth and the financial \nimbalances that develop during economic upturns sow the seeds fo r future financial instability. \nIn a similar manner, a Norwegian economist looked  at banking and financial crises in Norway \n9 \n \n\n10 \n going all the way back to the early 1800s. She f ound that every major cris is was preceded by a \nrapid run-up in real housing prices. Consequently , it is apparent that uns ustainable trends in \nhousing prices and home financing have been a major contributor to financial crises. \nThe United States stands virtually alone in its use of GSEs and significant subsidies to \npromote homeownership. Fannie Mae, Freddie M ac and their political supporters have long \nattempted to justify this system by saying that  “American housing finance is the envy of the \nworld.” Few would believe that today. \nIt is time for a significant change. We must move toward a system with fewer subsidies \nand misdirected incentives. Furthermore, to ensure  accountability, any hous ing subsidies that we \ndecide to keep should be made explicit, voted on transparently and carefully targeted to the \nintended beneficiaries: potential homeowners most in need and fo r whom such support will bring \nsuccess. \nMany of you might question whether a system w ith greatly reduced subsidies will work. \nA partial answer to this question can be found in international comparisons. A recent study, for \ninstance, found that in terms of homeownership rates, the United  States ranked only 17th out 26 \neconomically advanced countries . Many countries have achieve d higher homeownership rates \nwithout—and perhaps because they don’t have—many of the special privileges of U.S. housing \nfinance, such as GSEs, minimal down payments, 30-year fixed-rate loans and mortgage interest \ntax deductions. To this list, we could also add non-recourse debt instruments, government \npromotion of “creative and flexible financing,” th e ability to prepay loans, affordable housing \ngoals and similar government housing programs. \nIn making these remarks, I am not suggesting we do away with all support for housing. I \nam saying it is time for change."

Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n             \nNational Association of Business Economists Annual Meeting \nDenver, Colo.  \nOctober 12, 2010  \n \n           \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, \nofficers or representatives.   \n\n2 Introduction and Framework \nThank you, and it is a pleasure to welcome you to Denver . This is the largest \nmetropolitan ar ea in the Tenth Federal Reserve District and home to one of three branches of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The Denver branch serves Colorado, Wyoming and New \nMexico —three of the seven states of our region.  \nI appreciate this opportunity to engage and interact with business economists from around \nthe country regarding the policy choices now confronting the nation, especially those confronting the Federal Reserve.  \nIn setting out my views, I’ll first spend a minute describing the economy’s performan ce \nand then turn to the matter of quantitative easing versus my preferred path of gradual steps to a \nrenormalization of monetary policy.  \n \nShort -Term Outlook  \nCurrently, a major and necessary rebalancing is taking place within our economy . This \nincludes the deleveraging of consumers, businesses and financial institutions , and it's during a \ntime that state and local governments are struggling with budgets and mounting debt loads. In this context, a modest recovery with positive overall data trends should be se en as highly \nencouraging .  \nFollowing a bounce back from restocking earlier this year, the economy has slowed but it \nhas not faltered . GDP growth has averaged about a 2½ percent annual pace since the first of the \nyear. Industrial production is showing growt h of almost 6 percent , and high- tech more than \ndouble that. The consumer continues to buy goods, with personal income growing at more than a 3 percent rate, personal consumption expenditures at about 3 percent, and retail sales at more \n\n3 than 4 percent. And the U.S. economy has added more than  850,000 net new private sector jobs \nsince the first of the year . While modest, these are positive trends for the U.S. economy.  \n The issue is , of course , that while private jobs are being added within the economy, it is \nnot enough to bring unemployment down to where we all would like to see it . Unemployment \nremains stubbornly high at 9.6 percent . With such numbers, there is, understandably, a desire and \nconsiderable pressure for the Federal Reserve to “do something, anything” to get the economy \nback to full employment . And for many, including many economists, this means having the \nFederal Reserve maintain its zero interest rate policy or further still, enga ge in a seco nd round of \nquantitative easing – now called QE2. Some are even suggesting these actions are necessary for \nthe Federal Reserve to comply with its statutory mandate.  \n \nInterpreting the Policy Mandate \nThe FOMC’s policy mandate is defined in the Fe deral Reserve Act, which requires that: \n“The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long -run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate \nwith the economy's long- run potential to i ncrease production, so as to promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates .”   \nThere is , within the Act, a clear recognition that our policy goals are long -run in nature . \nIn this way, the Act reco gnizes that monetary policy works with long and variable lags. Thus, the \nFOMC should focus on fostering maximum employment and stable prices in the timeframe that monetary policy can legitimately affect – the future . The FOMC must be mindful of this fact a nd \nbe cautious in pursuing elusive short -term goals that have unintended and sometimes disruptive \neffects.  \n\n4 In recent weeks, some have argued that with inflation low  and the jobless rate high, the \nFederal Reserve should provide additional accommodation. Such an action  – the purchase of \nassets by the centr al bank as a policy easing tool – would mark a second round of quantitative \neasing . While there are several ways to accomplish this, many suggest that the most likely \nmethod would be for the Federal Reser ve to purchase additional long- term securities, including \nU.S. Treasuries.  \nProponents of QE2 argue that it would provide a near -term boost to the economy by \nlowering long- term interest rates while raising inflation . These benefits would arise from the \npurchase of U.S. Treasury securities, which would lead to lower U.S. Treasury and corporate \nrates. These lower interest rates would then stimulate consumer and business demand in several \nways, including encouraging mortgage refinancing that could lead to incr eased consumer \nspending, boosting exports through a likely lower exchange rate, and fostering higher equity prices, thereby creating additional wealth . Such a move is said to be consistent with the FOMC’s \nSeptember 21, 2010 announcement, which stated that it was “prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate.”  \nSuch easing, it is hoped, would bring inflation back up to something closer to 2 per cent, a \nrate that many judge to be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate. In addition, higher inflation would increase demand as consumers move purchases forward to avoid paying higher prices in the future.  \nSo, with these purported benefits, why would anyone disagree?  \n   \n\n5  New Risks and QE2  \nI believe there are legitimate reasons to be cautious when considering this approach . A \nmeaningful evaluation of QE2 must consider not simply whether benefits actually exist but, if \nthey do, how large they are and whether they are larger than possible costs.  \nBased on recent research and the earlier program of purchasing long -term securities —\nknown as LSAP —I think the benefits are likely to be smaller than the costs.  \nSome estimates suggest that purchasing $500 billion of long -term securities might reduce \ninterest rates by as little as 10 to 25 basis points. The LSAP program was effective, in part, because we were in a crisis . Financial markets were not functioning properly, or at all, during the \ndepths of the financia l crisis. In such a situation, it is reasonable that central bank purchases \nwould be useful and effective. However, currently the markets are far calmer than in the fall of 2008. The financial crisis has passed and financial markets are operating  more norm ally. One \ncould argue, in fact , that with markets mostly restored to pre -crisis functioning, the effect of asset \npurchases co uld be even smaller than the 10 to 25 basis point estimate .  \nI would also suggest that even if we achieved slightly lower interest rates, the effect on \neconomic activity is likely to be small. Interest rates have systematically been brought down to \nunprecedented low levels and kept there for an extended period. The economy’s response has been positive but modest.  \nIn fact, right now t he economy and banking system are awash in liquidity with trillions of \ndollars lying idle or searching for places to be deployed or , perhaps more recently , going into \ninflation hedges . Dumping another trillion dollars into the system now will most likely mean \nthey will follow the same path into excess reserves, or government securities, or “safe” asset purchases . The effect on equity prices is likely to be minor as well . There simply is no strong \nevidence the additional liquidity would be particularly effec tive in spurring new investment, \n\n6 accelerating consumption, or cushioning or accelerating the deleveraging that is hopefully \nwinding down.  \n If the purported benefits are small, what are the possible costs?   \nFirst, without clear terms and goals, quantitative easing becomes an open- ended \ncommitment that leads to maintaining the funds rate too low and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet too large . The result is a further misallocatio n of resources, more imbalances  \nand more volatility.  \nThere is no working framework that defines how a quantitative easing  program would be \nmanaged . How long would the program continue , and what would be the ultimate size?  Would \npurchases of long- term assets continue until the unemployment rate is 9 percent or 8 percent or  \neven less?  Would purchases continue until inflation rises to 2 percent or 3 percent or more?  Would the program aim to reduce  the 10 -year Treasury rate to 2 ¼ percent or 2 percent or even \nless?  Without answers to these and other questions, QE2 becomes an open- ended policy that \nintroduces additional uncertainty into markets with few offsetting benefits.  \nAs central b ank assets expand under quantitative easing , what will be the exit strategy?   \nIn the midst of a financial crisis, we may not have the luxury o f thinking about the exit strategy . \nIn current circumstances, however, we must define an exit strategy if the objective is to raise inflation but contain interest rate expectations. If history is any indication, without an exit strategy the natural tendenc y will be to maintain an accommodative policy for too long.  \nWhile I agree that the tools are available to reduce excess reserves when that becomes \nappropriate, I do not believe that the Federal Reserve, or anyone else, has the foresight to do it at the rig ht time or right speed. It may work in theory . In practice, however, the Federal Reserve \ndoesn’t have a good track record of withdrawing policy accommodation in a timely manner.  \n \n\n7  \nSecond, we risk undermining Federal Reserve independence.  QE2 actions approach \nfiscal policy actions. Purchasing private assets or long -term Treasury securities shifts risk from \ninvestors to the Federal Reserve and , ultimately , to U.S. taxpayers. It also encourages greater \nattempts to influence what assets the Federal Reserv e purchases. When the Federal Reserve buys \nlong-term securities  – such as  the $1.2 trillion in mortgage backed securities it purchas ed during \nthe financial crisis – it favors some segments of the market over others . And when the Federal \nReserve is a ready buyer of government debt, it becomes a convenient source of cash for fiscal programs . During a crisis this may be justified, but as a policy instrument during normal times it \nis very dangerous precedent.  \nThird, rather than inflation rising to 2 or 3 percent, and demand rising in a \nsystematic fashion, we have no idea at what level inflation might settle . It could remain \nwhere it is or inflation expectations could become unanchored and perhaps increase to 4 or \n5 percent . Not knowing what the outcome might be  makes quantitative easing a very risky \nstrategy . It amounts to attempting to fine -tune inflation expectations —a variable we cannot \nprecisely or accurately measure—over the next decade.  \nAnd why might inflation expectations become unanchored?   \nThe budget deficit for 2011 is expected to be about $1 trillion. Even if the Federal \nReserve were to purchase only $500 billion—and this amount in itself is a source of considerable \nuncertainty —that would appear to monetize one -half of the 2011 budget deficit . In addi tion, the \nsize of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet —now and over the next decade —will influence \ninflation expectations. Expanding the balance sheet by another $500 billion to $1 trillion over the next year, and perhaps keeping the balance sheet at $3 tri llion for the next several years, or \n\n8 increasing it even further, risks undermining the public’s confidence in the Fed’s commitment to \nlong run price stability, a key element of its mandate.  \nWhile QE2 might work in clean theoretical models, I am less confid ent it will work in the \nreal world . Again , I will note that the FOMC has never shown itself very good at fine -tuning \nexercises or in setting and managing inflation and inflation expectations to achieve the desired results.  \n Given the likely size of actions  and the time horizon over which QE2 would be in place, \ninflation expectations might very well increase beyond targeted levels, soon followed by a rise in long-term Treasury rates, thereby negating one of the textbook benefits of the policy.  \n \nNon-Zero Rat es as an Option  \nAt this point, with a modest recovery underway and inflation low and stable, I believe the \neconomy would be better served by beginning to normalize monetary policy . If long run stability \nis the goal, then re -normalizing policy is an importa nt step toward realizing that goal . How might \nwe achieve this goal?   \nFirst, rather than expand the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by purchasing additional \nU.S. Treasury securities, the Fed should consider discontinuing the policy of reinvesting principal  payments from agency debt and mortgage -backed securities into Treasury securities. \nGiven where we are, we would need to make such a change slowly but systematically . Allowing \nmaturing mortgage backed securities  to roll off, the Federal Reserve’s balance s heet would \nshrink gradually, with relatively small consequences for financial markets.  \nSecond, we should take the first early steps to normalize interest rate policy . This is not a \ncall for high rates but a call for non- zero rates . In 2003 the FOMC delayed our efforts to raise \nrates . In that period we reduced the federal funds rate to 1 percent and committed to keeping it \n\n9 there for a considerable period. This policy fostered conditions that let to rapid credit growth, \nfinancial imbalances and the eventual f inancial collapse from which we are still recovering . Had \nwe been more forceful in our action to renormalize policy then, it’s likely we might have suffered far less in 2008 through 2010.  \nAlso, any effort to renormalize policy would include signaling a cl ear intention to remove \nthe commitment to maintain the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent “for an extended period.”   As the public adjusts to this, we should then turn to determining the pace at which we return the funds rate to 1 percent . Once there, w e should pause, assess  and determine what additional \nadjustment might be warranted. A 1 percent federal funds rate is extremely accommodative, but from that point we could better judge the workings of the interbank and lending markets and determine the ord er of policy actions th at would support sustained long -term growth.  \n \nOther Concerns Regarding Zero Rates  \nThese are difficult times , no doubt , and it is tempting to think that zero interest rates can \nspark a quick recovery . However, we should not ignore the possible unintended consequences of \nsuch actions . Zero rates distort market functioning , including the interbank money and credit \nmarkets; zero rates lead to a search for yield and , ultimately , the mispricing of risk; zero rates \nsubsidize borrowers at the expense of savers.  \nFinally, it is important to note, that business contacts continue to tell me that interest rates \nare not the pressing issue. Rather, they are concerned with uncertainties around our tax structure; they are desperate to see this matt er settled . They need time to work through the recent \nhealthcare changes; and they are quite uncertain about how our unsustainable fiscal policy will be addressed . They are insistent that as these matters are addressed, they will once again invest \nand hire . QE2 cannot offset the fundamental factors that continue to impede our progress.  \n\n10  \nConclusion  \nWe are recovering from a set of shocks , and it will take time. These shocks did not \ndevelop overnight, but came after years of interest rates that were too low, l everage that was too \nhigh, and financial supervision that was too lax. If we have learned anything from this crisis, as \nwell as past crises, it is that we must be careful not to repeat the policy patterns we have used in previous recoveries, such as 1990- 91 and 2001. If we again leave rates too low for too long out \nof fear that the recovery is not strong enough, we are almost assured of suffering these same consequences yet again . I am fully committed to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to maintain \nlong-run growth so as to promote effectively the goals of ma ximum employment, stable prices  \nand moderate long- term interest  rates."

Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n          \nThe William Taylor Memorial Lecture  \nWashington, D.C. \nOct. 10, 2010 \n \n      \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, \nofficers or representatives.  \n  \n\nIntroduction \n I was honored to be asked to speak at this year’s William Taylor Memorial Lecture. I \nworked with Bill from th e time he arrived at the Board of Governors until he left to lead the \nFDIC. During the period that he led bank supervision activities for the Federal Reserve, I was in \nbanking supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, serving in a variety of areas \nfrom banking economist, to merger analyst, to discount window officer, to the officer in charge of Financial Supervision. During that period, including the crisis of the ’80s, nearly 350 banks \nwere closed or received open assistance in the Kansas Cit y District states alone. I think it’s fair to \nsay I was a student of Bill Taylor.  \nDuring the recent financial crisis, as ever more serious problems emerged, I couldn’t help \nbut think back to Bill. I remembered how he managed the numerous problems that emer ged with \nalmost infinite regularity during that earlier period; how he led our efforts in dealing with the \nOhio thrift crisis, the New England financial crisis, the Midwest ag crisis, the Southwest energy \ncrisis and bank failures as large as Continental Il linois, which at that time was the seventh largest \nbank in the United States with operations in 29 countries. I recall how Bill coolly dealt with CEOs of the largest banks in America. He also was blunt and straight with the facts when \nworking with us in the field or in talking to a senator, or even to his boss, Paul Volcker.  \nAs I looked back to this period, it occurred to me that few of our current examiners were \naround during those years and fewer still knew Bill, so at our Bank we wrote a small book calle d \nIntegrity, Fairness and Resolve: Lessons from Bill Taylor and the Last Financial Crisis,  which \nhas circulated to bank examiners pretty broadly. A copy is available for each of you this evening, \nand I hope you will take the opportunity to read this short biography that explains why so many \nrespect Bill Taylor so highly.  \nI cannot say with certainty how Bill would have dealt with all aspects of this most recent \ncrisis. But like Paul, I am confident we would have been well served had Bill Taylor been with \nus in the times leading up to this crisis, and that the regulatory reform legislation just enacted \nwould have been something less than 2,300 pages long. That said, the Bill Taylor story isn’t just the what -if musings of a bank supervisor. The story is about leadership and is particularly timely \nnow because without strong leadership, current regulatory reform efforts will fail.  \nThe president’s signature on the Dodd- Frank Act is only the beginning of a process. The \nAct is long, complex, sometimes extremely pre cise and other times vague and confusing. It has \n\nprovisions which require that an enormous number of rules be written and expertise be \ndeveloped across a host of financial activities and firms. With that in mind, I will touch on only a \nsample of the key is sues that confront us with this legislation and its implementation.  \n First, the Act outlines a method to resolve our largest firms, and I am hopeful that it will \nbe implemented with force and clarity. However, until proven otherwise, it would be unwise to \nignore the reality of size and influence on future decisions regarding these largest institutions.  \nSecond, uncertainty around “too big to fail” makes the Volcker Rule and the \nimplementation of strong capital rules all the more critical in minimizing the likelihood that these \ninstitutions again cause a financial crisis that undermines our national and global economies.  \nThird and most important, we need leaders like Bill Taylor who understand financial \ninstitutions and have the wisdom to ask the right ques tions, the courage to call it as they see it \nand the resolve to overcome the inevitable obstacles to strong supervision.  \n \nResolution and the Future  \n As we think about a resolution process for this country’s largest financial institutions, it is \nimportant first to consider what the failure of such a firm implies for our economy. The largest \nbank holding company in the United States controls more than $2.4 trillion of assets, which is \nroughly 16 percent of GDP. The largest five institutions control $8.4 trillion of assets, nearly 60 \npercent of GDP, and the largest 20 control $12.8 trillion of assets or almost 90 percent of GDP.  \n It's pretty certain that should any one of these firms encounter significant trouble, the \nnegative, systemic effects for creditors would be immediate and the adverse impact on \nbusinesses and consumers would soon be evident. The uncertainty from such a failure on other \nfirms who are interconnected or who followed the same lending path would affect confidence in \nthe entire nati onal and global economies.  \nThe Dodd- Frank Act outlines a process for resolving failed “systemically important” \nfirms at no cost to taxpayers. It calls for taking a firm into receivership when it defaults and \nhaving stockholders and creditors absorb the losses to avoid taxpayer bailouts. It allows for \nbridge banks and transitional funding to continue essential operations and services for \nmaintaining financial stability. To the extent that we achieve this outcome, our economy and our \ncountry will be well ser ved.  \n\nHowever, the reality is that the possible adverse effects on the global economy of a \nfailure of such a firm would be enormously destabilizing and harmful.  \n What Federal Reserve chair, FDIC chair, or secretary of Treasury would risk an \neconomic collapse when by making some creditors whole, the panic might be stopped?  And I \ncan assure you that when the regulatory authorities begin the process for recommending \nreceivership, they almost certainly will find themselves facing an atomic force of resistance  from \nthose at risk.  \nI have another practical reason for doubting that our too- big-to-fail problem has been \nsolved. Prior to Dodd- Frank, the Bank Holding Act allowed regulators to force the termination of \nactivities or sale of subsidiaries that are a risk  to the safety and soundness of an affiliate bank. To \nmy knowledge, this authority has never been successfully used for a major banking organization.  \nThe reality is that unless the rules are written so tightly that there remains no bailout \noption, we cannot be confident that “too big to fail” has ended.  \n \nVolcker Rule  \n The possible continued existence of “too big to fail” highlights the importance of other \nprovisions of the Act, especially the Volcker Rule.  \nIt has been noted that commercial banks hold the  franchise for our nation’s payments \nsystem. They carry the responsibility of trusted intermediary for our deposits used in payments \nand trusted repository for much of our savings and trust assets. These critical roles explain why \ncommercial banks are prov ided a substantial safety net – which includes access to the enormous \nresources of the central bank and deposit insurance.  \nFor several decades following the Great Depression and the reforms of that time, it was \nunderstood that commercial banks would be af forded these special protections and privileges but \nin return they would be limited in their risk -taking. The Glass -Steagall Act codified this \nunderstanding.  \nIn 1999 with the Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act, the separation of commercial banks and the \nmore highly ri sk-oriented investment banks was ended under the rationale that it would enhance \ncompetition and extend services to the public. The largest institutions lobbied extensively for this \nchange using their great wealth and influence to see it successfully passed.  \n\nSome of us who had experienced the chaos of the ’80s, including individuals like Paul \nVolcker and Bill Taylor, had long -held concerns that if the separation of commercial and \ninvestment banking activities were ended, it would lead to ever -larger concen trations of financial \nassets and would worsen the problem of “too big to fail.” The truth is it took less than a decade \nfor our first major crisis related to this merging of activities to occur.  \nIn the period leading up to this most recent crisis, the reg ulatory authorities, like the \nindustry, trusted that the market would self -regulate. It didn’t, it can’t and it won’t.  The \nindustry's structure and incentives are now inconsistent with the market being the disciplinarian.  \nThe Volcker Rule does not reinst itute Glass -Steagall. It does improve the odds toward \nfinancial stability by instituting a partial return to the separation of commercial and investment banking activities. It strives to affirm the principle that those institutions that by their franchise \nhave access to the safety net should be separated from those firms that are free to speculate with \nshareholder, not taxpayer, funds.  \nPaul has it right.  \n \nCapital Standards  \nWhat about capital and our banking system?  To me, it is a simple fact that the rule s \naround bank capital define the strength of our financial system in the long run. Capital, which I \ndefine simply as tangible common equity, serves first as a discipline on a bank’s appetite for risk \nand, when needed, helps absorb losses from unexpected shocks. And finally, it gives confidence \nto depositors and other creditors that a firm can reasonably be expected to withstand an \neconomic downturn.  \nHowever, the expansion of the safety net and the incentives this engenders discourages \nequity capital on a bank’s balance sheet. Financial firms enhance the returns to investors by \n“leveraging up” assets against this capital. The market, knowing the safety net is in place and \nassuming the most influential firms will be bailed out, lends at favorable rates and fa cilitates the \ntrend toward ever -greater leverage and risk. Like Gresham's Law on money, bad capital drives \nout good capital.  \nTo address this weakness in the system, the Dodd- Frank legislation instructs the \nregulatory authorities to set up appropriate capi tal and leverage standards. This process is also \n\nunder way at the international level, with the completion of the Basel standards, requiring higher \nlevels and stronger forms of capital.  \nAlthough this is a good start in establishing meaningful capital leve ls, those responsible \nfor financial oversight will face a heavy burden to hold firms to any enhanced capital standard. It \ntakes time to build capital. It inhibits the payments of dividends that banks are eager to restart.  \nWe can be certain that there will  be an enormous effort put forward to substitute other \nforms of liabilities for equity or to change the terms. The industry and others will remind us often \nthat to place too high a capital requirement or too short a time horizon on the industry will \nconstr ain credit and slow the recovery and expansion. However, we can be just as confident that \ncurrent equity capital standards must be set much higher than recent levels if the industry is to retain the public's trust and be a source of sustained credit and ec onomic growth.  \nAs a Swiss central banker once insisted to me many years ago, “ [I]t is the central bank's \njob to focus on the long run so that the short run can take care of itself.”  \nFor me, one certain lesson from this most recent crisis is that both th e industry and \nsupervisory authorities lost sight of the long run.  \nThe industry over a series of years systematically pushed to increase its flexibility around \nunderwriting greater levels of risk, pursuing greater leverage for the sake of short -term retur ns. \nRisk management systems were weakened or abandoned outright. Executives whose job it was to sound the alarm were ignored or in some cases dismissed.  \nThe CEO and boards of directors of many companies didn’t have any reasonable \nunderstanding of the risk s they were taking and didn’t care so long as profits flowed quarter to \nquarter. They failed in their fiduciary duties.  \nThe regulators also came up short. They too often allowed leverage to increase to \nunprecedented levels without raising alarms. They bac ked down to congressional and industry \npressure. The fallout of such failures is now all too obvious.  \n Any regulatory reform will fail unless the industry and the regulatory authorities are \nresolute in their commitment. We should not have needed legislati on to tell us the necessity of \nmaintaining strong capital and underwriting standards. It should not have taken legislation for us to recognize the importance of controlling conflicts of interest and addressing early on the issues \naround moral hazard that have undermined the integrity of our financial system. It also is not a \nmatter of too many regulators because recent experience dismisses that as the core issue.  \n\n \nThe Bill Taylor Rule  \nNo, the core issue is leadership.  We need leadership that reflects the highest level of \nintegrity, is trusted at the outset as fair and has the resolve to implement a regulatory program \nthat looks past special interest and focuses on the system.  Why don't we just call it the Bill \nTaylor Rule.  \nBill recognized that the failure of a bank, regardless of its size, had an important impact \non the community it served, its business customers and consumers. He understood that the job of \na bank supervisor was not to close banks, but to enforc e rules and exercise regulatory judgment \nthat minimized bank failures. He encouraged strong capital standards, insisted on tough examinations and outlined careful actions with a focus toward mitigating problems and \nstrengthening the system before it became subject to unmanageable crises.  \nThere is one additional characteristic of Bill Taylor that enabled him to be a great leader \nin bank supervision: He was a commissioned examiner. He knew what the examiners were \nfacing. He knew the tricks of the frauds and the arguments of desperate bankers. Bill insisted that \nhis briefings come from the field examiner of a problem bank, not the officer in charge.  \nWith Bill, you didn’t worry about his past, current or future conflicts. Nothing prevented \nhim from telling the  hard facts. He was not concerned with re- election, reappointment or \nfundraising. He had no paid speeches or consulting contracts. He wasn’t “giving back” or building his resume. Bill understood the unique role a financial regulator should play outside of \npolitics and profit. \n Bill Taylor was the cop on the beat and Bill Taylor is the model on which to write the \njob description for those who will lead financial supervision.  \n \nConclusion  \nI will close with an excerpt from a speech Bill gave in 1987 in which he anticipated with \namazing accuracy today’s events. He said:  \n“The banking structure of the country will change. It’s … now a matter of playing it out \n... to a nationwide banking arrangement. ... Although I have some hope for moderation, the \nincreased competition brought about by all these changes in combination with the fascination of \nthis country for debt and leverage will continue to create stress that will require very close \n\nattention. ... Now, one never knows. It's not over ’til it's over. ... (This) ol d examiner … has these \nsuspicions lurking in his heart. Suspicions that say the answer to world hunger is not eating \nsomeone else’s lunch.\"  \nBill called it as he saw it. And once again, Bill was right."

            "content": "September 30, 2010  \n \n  \nTo: Tenth Federal Reserve District Members of Congress  \n Re: TARP recipients and dividend payment s \n \nOn September 14, The Washington Post  published an article referring to small banks as \n“deadbeats” for deferring the payment of dividends on TARP preferred stock. While this characterization is inaccurate from any source, it is extremely frustrating when it comes in the paper of record for ou r nation’s capital.  The article shows an unfortunate lack of understanding \nof the TARP and how it has been implemented within the banking industry broadly.  Given the paper’s readership, I wanted to provide a more complete picture of the TARP dividend pay ments \nto members of Congress served by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  \n The depth of the economic problems that our nation faced challen ged the entire banking \nindustry.  Large and small banks both made serious errors during the buildup to this most recent \ncrisis.  Banks from both groups also received TARP funds.  To suggest that banks in one group are “deadbeats, ” simply choosing to dismiss  their financial responsibilities, w hile ignoring the \nconcessions allowed for some larger banks  is to grossly misrepresent the realities involved in \nrestoring the financial industry.   \n The banking indus try is recovering from a major financial crisis, and the process of \nrebuilding financial health will be a lengthy one for many large and small banks .  In such times, \nthe most prudent course of action for banks is to acknowledge their losses, conserve capital for future losses, and acquire additional capital if necessary.  In fact, banks in troubled condition are subject to supervisory actions that expressly limit dividend payments at t he direction of bank \nregulators.  Long- standing regulatory policy discourages the payment of dividends during those \ntimes when capital needs to be conserved; the health of the institution must come before the wealth of the stockholders. \n The Federal Reserv e issued updated guidance to bank holding companies in March 2009, \nreiterating the importance of banking organizations conserving their capital especially when experiencing financial difficulties and/or receiving public funds.  In the supporting FAQs, this  \nsupervisory guidance specifically addressed under what conditions it would be appropriate for a TARP recipient – large or small  – to defer payment of dividends:  \n \n“A board of directors’ decision to defer a dividend on a government investment – \nas with all other instruments in the capital structure – should be based primarily on the extent to which deferral is necessary for the bank holding company to preserve capital to continue operating in a safe and sound manner and serving as a source of strength to its depository institution subsidiaries.”  \n  \n\n \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City   Page Two  \n \n \nTo encourage banks to do otherwise helps neither the banks nor the taxpayers in the long \nrun.  The TARP program was initially designed for the largest banks, which received most of the TARP funding.  Large banks had many advantages over small banks in repa ying these funds, \nincluding their “too big to fail” guarantees.  Smaller banks fail when they are deemed insolvent.  “Too big to fail ” also has given the largest banks better access to capital markets.  Smaller banks \ntypically are more closely held or thi nly traded, and have more limited access to capital \nespecially as their condition weakens.  The real estate problems challenging many smaller banks \nare long -term problems, and their extended recovery is at odds with the TARP incentives for \nrapid repayment.    \n So while the only option for some smaller TARP recipients to conserve capital  may have \nbeen  to temporarily defer dividends, some of the largest TARP recipients were able to \nrenegotiate  the terms of their TARP funding  to eliminate or reduce the dividend obligation.  Last \nyear, Citigroup eliminate d the  dividend obligation on its TARP preferred stock when the \ngovernment agreed to convert its holdings to common stock.  Ac cording to recent articles  in The \nWall Street Journal , similar option s may be under consideration for Ally Financial  and AIG .  \nThese actions may be appropriate policy to support financial recovery, but the financial \nimplications may be far more significant than the dividend deferrals criticized by T he \nWashington Post.  It is worth noting that the  government  funding provided to Citigroup  alone \nwas more than  three times the total TARP funding provided to banks with assets below  $10 \nbillion . \n It remains to be seen whether the application of TARP funds to small banks proves to \nhave been beneficial to the recove ry of the banking industry.  However,  to suggest that banks \ndeferring their TARP dividends are doing so inappr opriately is to misrepresent a n entire portion \nof the industry and further distort the reputation of small banks that largely remain a key economic strength in communities across the country .   \n Although it isn’t possible to control how the media presents or misrepresents information, \nI thought it important to bring this issue to your attention.  As always, I am available to answer any questions  that you or your  staff may have about this or any other issue  relating to the health \nof our financial system and economy.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nThomas M.

Hoenig \n \nPresident \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \nbefore the \n \nSubcommittee on Oversight  and Investigations \n \nUnited States House of Representatives \n       \n \n         \nOverland Park, Kan. \nAug. 23, 2010  \n\n2 \n Chairman Moore and members of the Committ ee, thank you for the opportunity to testify \nat this timely hearing on the future of community banks. \nOver the past 20 years, as the banking indus try has consolidated into fewer and larger \nbanks, a perennial question has been, “Is the comm unity bank model viable?”  The short answer \nis, yes. The longer answer is, yes, if they ar e not put at a competitiv e disadvantage by policies \nwhich favor and subsidize the largest financia l institutions.  I have worked closely with \ncommunity bankers my entire  career, through good and bad economic times.  I know their \nbusiness model works.   \nThere are more than 6,700 banks in the count ry, and all but 83 would be considered \ncommunity banks based on a commonly used cuto ff of $10 billion in assets.  In the Tenth \nFederal Reserve District, we have about 1,100 banks, and all but 3 would be considered a \ncommunity bank.  A lower threshold of $250 mill ion, which focuses on a far more homogeneous \ngroup, includes about 4,600 institutions or a bout two-thirds, of all banks.  My submitted \nmaterials and remarks now are directed toward th is group of banks, which serve Main Street in \ncommunities across the country.  \n Community banks are essentia l to the prosperity of the local and regional economies \nacross the country. The maps I provided show that community banks have the majority of offices \nand deposits in almost a third of all counties na tionwide.  However, their presence and market \nshare are most substantial among Midwestern states , where their role is pa rticularly crucial in \nrural areas and smaller cities.  It is the economies in these states that would suffer most \nsignificantly without th eir presence.  Why? \nCommunity banks have maintained a str ong presence despite i ndustry consolidation \nbecause their business model focuses on strong re lationships with their customers and local \ncommunities. Community banks serve all facets  of their local economy including consumers, \nsmall businesses, farmers, real estate deve lopers, and energy producers.  They know their \ncustomers and local markets well; they know that their success depends on the success of these \nlocal firms; and they recognize that they have to be  more than a gatherer of funds if they hope to \nprosper.  These factors are a pow erful incentive to target their unde rwriting to meet specific local \ncredit needs.  And it gives their customers an advantage of knowing with whom they will work \nin both good and difficult economic times.  Larger banks are important to a firm as they grow \n\n3 \n and need more complicated financing, but in this  region, most businesses are relatively small and \ntheir needs can be met by that local bank. \nIt is said that a community with a local ba nk can better control its destiny.  Local deposits \nprovide funds for local loans.  Community bank s are often locally owne d and managed – through \nseveral generations of family ownership. This vested interest in the success of their local \ncommunities is a powerful incentive to  support local initiatives. It is the very “skin in the game” \nincentive that regulato rs are trying to reintr oduce into the largest banks.  It’s the small \ncommunity’s version of “risking you r own funds” that worked so we ll in the original investment \nbanking model, and kept partners  from making risky mistakes th at would result in personal \nbankruptcy back then, and government intervention more recently. \nThere is no better test of th e viability of the community bank business model than the \nfinancial crisis, recession, and abnormally slow recovery that we’ve experienced over the past \n2½ years.  The community bank business model has held up well when compared with the megabank model that had to be propped up wi th taxpayer funding.  Community bank earnings \nlast year were lower than desi red but on par with t hose of larger banks.  However, community \nbanks generally had higher capital ratios that pu t them in a better position to weather future \nproblems and support lending. \nThis is an important point to note as the decline in overall bank le nding, particularly to \nsmall businesses, is a major concern.  Data s how that community banks have done a better job \nserving their local loan needs ove r the past year.  Community banks , as a whole, increased their \ntotal loans by about 2 percent as compared to a 6 percent decline for larg er banks.  In addition, \ncommunity banks have had either stronger loan growth or smalle r declines across major loan \ncategories.  Business lending in  particular stands out, with community bank loans dropping only \n3 percent as compared with a 21 percent decline for larger banks.  \nOf course, some community banks made poor  lending and investment decisions during \nthe housing and real estate boom of the mid 2000s.   Unlike the largest banks, community banks \nthat fail will be closed or sold.  For community banks that survive, it will be a struggle to recover.  Commercial real estate, particularly la nd development loans, will be a drag on earnings \nfor some quarters yet.  Neverthe less, for those that recover, a business model that continues to \nfocus on customer relationships will be a source of strength for local economies.   \n \n\n4 \n Thus, community banks will survive the crisis  and recession and will continue to play \ntheir role as the economy recovers.   The more la sting threat to their survival, however, concerns \nwhether this model will continue to be placed at a competitive disadvantage to larger banks.  \nBecause the market perceived the largest banks as being too big to fail, they have had the \nadvantage of running their busine ss with a much greater level of  leverage and a consistently \nlower cost of capital and debt.  The advantage of  their too-big-to-fail status was highlighted \nduring the crisis, when the FD IC allowed unlimited insurance on non-interest-bearing checking \naccounts out of concern that businesses would move their deposits from the smaller to the largest \nbanks.  As outrageous as it seems, in many cases it is easier  for larger banks to expand through \nacquisitions into smaller communities.  This occu rs because smaller banks tend to focus on their \nlocal markets and therefore often face significant an titrust restrictions to in-market mergers. This \npolicy ignores the fact that the largest 20 banking organizations in  the United States now control \njust less than 80% of the industry’s total assets. \nGoing forward, the community bank model will face challenges.  Factors such as higher \nregulatory compliance costs and changing technology will encourage community bank \nconsolidation.  And despite the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to end too big to fail, \ncommunity banks will continue to face higher co sts of capital and deposits until investors are \nconvinced it has ended.  But community banks have  always faced such challenges.  They have \nsurvived and prospered.  If allowed to compet e on a fair and level playing field, the community \nbank model is a winner."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n           \nTown Hall Meeting \nLincoln, Nebraska \nAugust 13, 2010 \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n The views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \nThese are trying times for the U.S. econom y.  The unemployment rate is almost 10 \npercent, our financial system remains under stress, community bank failures have become \nweekly news and the central bank is printing money to such an extent that zero interest rates \nbring little return to t hose who choose to save.  \nNot in decades has the Federal Reserve seen such challenges in how it conducts monetary \npolicy.  With this in mind, this morning I will give you my sense of the issues we face and the \nhard choices that must be made.  I'll begin by focusing on financial reform  legislation, including \nmy observations about where we are with too-bi g-to-fail.  Then I'll turn to the economy and \nmonetary policy. \n \nRegulatory Choices  \n \nOn March 6, 2009, I gave a speech in Omaha called “Too Big Has Failed.”  I shared my \nthoughts about the financial crisis and my c oncern for the long-run effects of bailing out \ninvestors of the largest financial institutions .  That speech hit a nerve by stating what many \nconsidered a simple truth, which is that taxp ayers should not subsidiz e our largest financial \nfirms. With our very important Federal Reserv e Branch office in Omaha, I have been in \nNebraska many times since then, but this is my first trip back after the passage of financial \nreform legislation, so it seems an  appropriate time to review some of the implications of enacting \nthe 2,300-page law.   \nOverall, important steps were taken in an e ffort to strengthen and enhance the regulatory \nframework and accountability of fina ncial institutions.  However, th e success of this legislation \nentirely depends on how well regulatory authorities implement the new requirements. \nThere is, for example, a provision called the Volcker Rule, which will limit \na large firm’s ability to set up speculative activit ies.  So-called “proprietary” trading and the \nsponsorship of hedge funds that engage in hi gher-risk activities must be done outside of \ncommercial banks and bank holding companies, away  from direct access to insured funds and \nthe Federal Reserve’s discount window. This is an important provision.  However, there are exceptions to the rule and, again, whether it work s as intended will depend on how strongly  the \nrules are written, and how well they  are interpreted and enforced. \n\nThe legislation also sets up a new consumer bureau to address the gaps in unregulated \nand under-regulated financial firms, including mortgage finance companies, payday lenders and \ncredit card issuers.  Its success will depend on whether it can appropriately identify those \ninstitutions exploiting those gaps and bring them into accepted sta ndards of behavior.  If the new \nbureau merely directs its resources to the already heavily regulated community banks, its \nbeneficial effects will be minor.  A targeted implem entation program is critical if the consumer is \nto experience the hoped-for benefits. \nThe legislation primarily hoped to address th e public’s concerns about too-big-to-fail \ninstitutions—that is, those that are so large a nd interconnected that th ey will be bailed out by \ntaxpayers no matter what risks a nd bad decisions they make because they are too “systemically \nimportant” to be allowed to fail.  Whether or not  too-big-to-fail is addr essed by this legislation \ndepends on the leadership at the regulatory agenci es when the next crisis occurs.  The law now \nrequires that the FDIC take into receivership an  institution that is designated as “in default or \ndanger of default” for which the regular bankrupt cy process would have systemic consequences.  \nThe process for taking this action is complex, requ iring multiple regulatory parties to agree, the \nTreasury Secretary making the final determination with the President’s concurrence, and a court \nruling that the action isn’t arbitrar y and capricious.  This will be an incredible challenge for the \nregulatory agencies.  Recent experience tells us that  time is of the essence in a national liquidity \ncrisis. It will be extremely difficult in practice to  designate the largest institutions as insolvent, \ntake them over and liquidate.  The simple trut h is “too-big-to-fail” wi ll not go away easily. \nOur largest institutions, even after their poor performance during this last crisis, remain \nfinancially and politically powerful institutions.  It gives me pause, for example, that after the recent devastating experience of the global bank ing crisis, regulatory au thorities are already \nbacking off initial attempts to strengthen in ternational capital requirements for these largest \nbanks and financial firms.  The Basel Committee just announced an agreement to establish for our largest global banks a Tier 1 ca pital-to-asset ratio of 3 percent.   This is a 33-to-1 leverage \nratio.  Bear Stearns entere d this crisis and failed with a 34-to-1  leverage ratio.  It leaves a small \ncushion for error and is a level of  risk that I judge unacceptable.  \nAs I consider the outlook for financial regu lation, I am hopeful but realistic re garding  \nwhether next time things will be different.   Regulatory agencies have been given a mandate and authority to strengthen oversight of the larges t firms.  Success will depend on whether we choose \nto make hard calls and to use the new author ity with integrity, fairness and resolve.   \n\n \nMonetary Choices  \n \nI want to spend my remaining time on mone tary policy.  I acknowledge that there are \ndifferent perspectives on the array of economic data we receive and analyze, and therefore there \nare legitimate, differing views a bout what is best for the econo my. The Federal Reserve has a \ndual mandate to pursue stable prices and stab le long-term growth.  The entire FOMC is \ncommitted to pursuing those goals, but there are differing views on the causes and fixes to our current situation.   \nI have been at the Fed through past swings in the business cycle.  There is today a \nfamiliar theme as I listen to the media, various economists and “market experts.”  They say we are entering the era of a “new normal” in whic h we have to accept high unemployment and low \nincome growth and that interest rates will remain at  zero indefinitely.  They warn that deflation is \na serious risk and that the U.S. could become another Japan, which must be avoided at all costs.  Before this week’s FOMC meeting, The Wall Street Journal wrote that the Fed would add more \nstimulus into the economy—including the purchase of long-term treasuries.  It turns out that \nreporter was remarkably prescient.  \nI share these concerns about our econo my.  Economic conditions are far from \nsatisfactory, unemployment is simply too high, and we  want a stronger recovery.  But as much as \nI want short-term improvement, I am mindful of possible longer-term consequences of zero \ninterest rates and further easing actions.  Rather than improve economic outcomes, I worry that \nthe FOMC is inadvertently adding to “uncerta inty” by taking such actions.  Remember, high \ninterest rates did not cause the financial crisis or the recessi on.  Let me summarize four key \npoints that I judge releva nt in choosing among moneta ry policy options.   \n \nTrend data show modest recovery \n \nThe recovery is proceeding as many economists ear lier this year outlined  that it would.  It \nis a modest recovery, with mixed results.  Yet,  GDP is likely to expand at somewhere around a 3 \npercent rate through the re mainder of the year.  Month-to-month data will be mixed, as is typical \nduring recovery.  For example, industrial pr oduction was down 0.3 percent for April, up 1.3 \npercent for May, and up 0.1 per cent for June.  New orders for non-defense capital goods \n\nexcluding aircraft were down 2.8 percent in Ap ril, up 4.7 percent in May, and up 0.6 percent in \nJune.  Durable goods orders were up by 2.9 percen t in April, down 0.7 percent in May and down \n1.2 percent in June.  Corporate profits are bei ng reported as consistently strong, month after \nmonth.  What these data points tell me is that  volatile monthly data should not drive policy \nactions. \nWhile monthly data may be mixed, the trend data are consistently positive. Private job \ngrowth has been less than hoped for but positiv e nonetheless.  Private payrolls increased 630,000 \nsince January 1.  In the first half of the year, private labor income incr eased in all components: \nhours worked, employment and wages.  Hours worked have risen more rapidly than \nemployment, which is typical for the early stages of an economic  recovery.  In fact, we are \nexperiencing a better pace of rec overy this time than at this po int in our previous two economic \nrecoveries.    \nIn addition, since the second quarter of 2009, personal income growth has increased 2.8 \npercent, consumption is up 1.6 percent, investment  in equipment and software is up 15 percent, \nand housing is up 5.3 percent.  Year-over-year, in dustrial production is up 8.2 percent, high tech \nis up 20 percent and manufacturing is up 8.3 percen t.  Corporate profits are up 57 percent since \nthe fourth quarter of 2008. While we are not where we want to be, the economy is recovering \nand, barring specific shocks and bad policy, it shoul d continue to grow over the next several \nquarters. \n \nCorrections take time \n \nWe are recovering from a horrific set of shocks, and it will take time to “right the ship.”  \nMoreover, the financial and economic shocks we have experienced did not “just happen.”  The \nfinancial collapse followed years of too-low in terest rates, too-high leverage, and too-lax \nfinancial supervision as pres cribed by deregulation from both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations.  In judging how we approach this recovery, it seems to me that we need to be \ncareful not to repeat those policy patterns that followed the recessions of 1990-91 and 2001.  If \nwe again leave rates too low, too long out of our uneasiness over the strength of the recovery and \nour intense desire to avoid recessi on at all costs, we are risking a repeat of past errors and the \nconsequences they bring. \n\nHere are some important figures regarding just how out of balance our economy became \nand what might have contributed to these im balances between the early ‘90s and today: \n• The real fed funds rate averaged 1.6 percent between 1991 and 1995, 0.37 percent \nbetween 2001 and 2005 and -1.0 percent from 2008 to the present, hardly a tight \npolicy environment. \n•  Gross federal debt increased from 60 percent to 75 percent of nominal GDP \n•  Consumer debt increased from 63 pe rcent to 94 percent of nominal GDP \n•  Nonfinancial debt increased from 189 pe rcent of nominal GDP at the start of the \ndecade to 234 percent by December 2008. \n• Between 1993 and 2007, the average leverage of the 20-largest financial \ninstitutions in the U.S. (total assets-to- tangible equity capital) increased from 18-\nto-1, to over 25-to-1, reac hing as high as 31-to-1. \n• The U.S. increased its debt to the rest of  the world dramatically from 4.87 percent \nto 24.32 percent of nominal GDP. \n \nObviously, the effect of these trends on our  economy has been significant and we must \naccept that they will not be corrected quickly. \n \nIt is not time for tight policy \n \nIn my view, maintaining an accommodative mone tary policy is necessary at this time, but \na clear policy path toward a less highly accommodative policy will encourage a more sustained \nrecovery.  Under such a policy, financial dele veraging will evolve slowly and many of the \nremaining economic imbalances will rebalance.   Under such a policy, the economy will expand \nat a sustainable moderate pace with similar mode rate job growth, but job growth that will be \nstable and resilient.  There may be ways to  accelerate GDP growth, but in my view, highly \nexpansionary monetary policy is not a good option.   \nTo be clear, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy.  I am a dvocating a policy that \nremains accommodative but slowly firms as the economy itself expands and moves toward more \nbalance.  I advocate dropping the “extended peri od” language from the FOMC’s statement and \nremoving its guarantee of low rates.  This tells the market that it must again accept risks and lend \nif it wishes to earn a return.  The FOMC would announce that its policy rate will move to 1 \n\npercent by a certain date, subject to current conditions.  At 1 per cent, the FOMC would pause to \ngive the economy time to adjust and to gain c onfidence that the recovery remains on a reasonable \ngrowth path.  At the appropriate time, rates would be moved further up toward 2 percent, after \nwhich the nominal fed funds rate will depend on how well the economy is doing. \nIf such a path were chosen, then how mi ght GDP and important components perform?  \nLet me start with consumption, which for d ecades amounted to about 63 percent of GDP.  \nDuring the boom it rose to 70 percent.  It seem s reasonable that the consumer will most likely \nreturn toward more historical levels relative to  GDP and then grow in line with income.  If so, \nthe consumer will contribute to growth but is unli kely to intensify its contribution to previously \nunsustainable levels. \nTo view the role of the consumer from a nother perspective, I w ould note that personal \nsavings declined from nearly 10 percent of dis posable income in 1985 to less than 2 percent in \n2007.  It is now closer to 6 percent, better in  many ways, but still below historical norms. \n Assuming it stabilizes and pe rsonal incomes grows as it has so  far this recovery, you get a \nclearer sense of how consumption will contribute to the economy’s expansion but also why it is \nunlikely to play a dominant role as it did in this past decade. \nWhile businesses need to rebalance as well, they are essential to the strength of the \nrecovery.  Fortunately, they are in the early stages of doing just  that.  Profits are improving and \ncorporate balance sheets for the nonf inancial sector are strengtheni ng and are increasingly able to \nsupport investment growth as confidence in the economy rebuilds.  Also, although credit supply \nand demand may be an issue impeding the recovery  to some extent, a shortage of monetary \nstimulus is not the issue.  There is enormous liquidity in the market, and it can be accessed as \nconditions improve. \nFinally, the federal government needs to rebala nce its balance sheet as well.  Federal and \nstate budget pressures are enormous, and uncertain tax programs surely are a risk to the recovery.  \nThis adds harmful uncertainty upon both busine sses and consumers.  However, while these \nburdens are a drag on our outlook, they are not new to the U.S. and, by themselves, should not \nbring our economy down unless they go unaddressed. \nI believe the economy has the wherewithal to rec over.  However, if, in an attempt to add \nfurther fuel to the recovery, a zero interest rate is  continued, it is as likely to be a negative as a \npositive in that it brings its own unintended cons equences and uncertainty.  A zero policy rate \n\nduring a crisis is understandable, but a zero rate after a year of recovery gives legitimacy to \nquestions about the sustainability of the recovery and adds to uncertainty. \n  \nMarket motives \n \nWe were reminded of the critic al nature of our financial ma rkets when they locked up \nduring the crisis.  We need mark ets to function smoothly.  However, market participants should \nnot direct policy.  When mixed data are reported as systematically negative results, and the more \npositive, long-term growth trends fail to be adeq uately acknowledged, it is an invitation to hasty \nactions.  Of course the market wants zero rates to continue indefinitely: They are earning a \nguaranteed return on free money from the Fe d by lending it back to the government through \nsecurities purchases.   \nThe current recovery in its fi rst year saw GDP grow an average of 3.2 percent.  The GDP \ngrowth rate for the 1991 recovery was 2.61 percent; and for the 2001 recovery, it was 1.92 \npercent.  We would all like to see a stronger recovery, but slow gr owth is not a decline in growth \nand we should not react hastily.   The summer of 2010 has seemed strikingly familiar to me.  I recently went back and looked at news reports for the spring and summer of 2003, just prior to when the FOMC lowered \nthe fed funds rate to 1 percent, where it rema ined until 2004.  I’ll provide just two examples. \nIn June 2003, one prominent economist noted in USA Today:   “The Federal Reserve Board \nrecently warned that America faces a risk of [deflation].  Japan has been suffering from it for \nmore than a decade.  Europe may be heading toward it.  The entire world economy could succumb to it.  …This could be the first r ound in a deflationary cycle.  The Commerce \nDepartment reports orders to U.S. factories slip ped 2.9% in April from March, the largest decline \nin 17 months.  …With fewer jobs and stagnant wa ges, Americans won’t be able to buy enough to \nkeep the economy going.” \nAlso in June 2003, a Boston Globe  columnist noted:  “On the surface, one can make the \ncase that the Fed doesn’t have to do anything at al l. Interest rates are incredibly low….Still, the \nFed will not sit on its hands.  Chairman Alan Greenspan and his deputies have done everything \nbut advertise the coming rate cut on the Goodyear blimp.  Their mo tivation is to avoid deflation. \n  …Another rate cut, even a cut of one-half poi nt, doesn’t guarantee that there won’t be an \neconomic collapse.  But it makes that collaps e less likely—hence the no tion of rate cut as \n\ninsurance policy.  As insurance, a rate cut is pr etty cheap.  Lower rates aren’t going to trigger a \nburst of inflation, and if they give the economy an extr a boost, well, who is going \nto complain about that?” \nIn the third quarter of 2003, immediately foll owing these and many similar articles, GDP \nexpanded at what turned out to be nearly a 7 perc ent annual rate, yet rates were left at 1 percent \nfor several months.  With the low rates very lo w for a considerable period, credit began to \nexpand significantly and set the stage for one of the worst economic crisis since the great \ndepression.  In my view, it was a very expensiv e insurance premium.  Unemployment today is \n9.5 percent.  I fully acknowledge that I was on the FOMC at that time.  That’s why I believe that \nzero rates during a period  of modest growth are a dangerous gamble. \nThe Great Depression of the 1930s was a traumatic event.  We need to be aware of its \nlessons.  We need to avoid its mistakes.  For example, the Fed should never again double reserve \nrequirements overnight.  However, I urge us not to forget other more-recent lessons from the \ngreat inflation and the financial crisis of 2008: R eal interest rates that are negative 40 percent of \nthe time create severe consequences.   \nOne final note about deflation: The consumer price index was a mere 18 in 1945 but was \n172 at the start of this century.  Today, despite our most recent crisis, the CPI is over 219.  Not \nonce during more than half a cen tury has the index sy stematically declined.  I find no evidence \nthat deflation is the most serious threat to the recovery today.  \nConclusion \n \nI agree that the Federal Reserve needs to keep  its policy rate accommodative.  For a while \nlonger, it should remain even below the long-run equilibrium rate.  However, the economy is \nimproving and is growing at a rate faster than the last two recoveries.  Importantly, the recent \nfinancial crisis and recession was not caused by high interest rates but by low rates that \ncontributed to excessive debt and leverage among consumers, businesses and government.  We \nneed to get off of the emergency rate of zero, move rates up slowly and deliberately.  This will \nalign more closely with the economy’s slow, deliberate recovery so that policy does not lag the recovery.   \nMonetary policy is a useful tool, but it cannot solve every problem faced by the United \nStates today.  In trying to use policy as a cure -all, we will repeat the cycle of severe recession \n\nand unemployment in a few short years by keeping rates too low for too long.  I wish free money \nwas really free and that there was a painless way to move from severe recession and high \nleverage to robust and sustainable econo mic growth, but there is no short cut."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n         \nBartlesville Federal Reserve Forum \nHosted by Bartlesville Chamber of Commerce \nBartlesville, Okla. \n \nJune 3, 2010 \n \n      \nThe views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives. \n  \n\n \n1 \n I appreciate the opportunity to  join you here today. Bartle sville plays an especially \nimportant role in the history of  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. After Congress passed \nthe Federal Reserve Act nearly a century ago, a special committee was appointed to determine \nwhere the nation’s 12 regional Federal Reserve Ba nks would be located and what regions those \nbanks would serve. When that committee met in Ka nsas City to discuss bu siness relationships in \nthe central United States, Frank Phillips was am ong those who attended and spoke in favor of \nlocating our Bank in Kansas City and having it serve Oklahoma. The support from Mr. Phillips \nand others from Oklahoma was absolutely critical to the eventual decisions that established the Bank in Kansas City and included Oklahoma in the Tenth Federal Reserve Dist rict that we serve. \nA few years after our founding, we opened our Oklahoma City Branch. This morning, the community and business leaders who serve on th e Branch’s Board of Directors – including \nBartlesville’s own K. Vasudevan – met here in Bartlesville, which seems especially appropriate. \nThis is not the only connection between th e Federal Reserve's founding and Oklahoma. \nThe Senate sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act was one of Oklahoma's first senators, Robert \nOwen. Senator Owen, like Mr. Phillip s, recognized the importance of  having the central bank of \nthe United States tied directly to America’s Ma in Streets and not isolat ed in Washington or on \nWall Street. That structure is at least as importa nt today as it was a centu ry ago. It is my hope \nthat, after much debate, the regulatory reform  legislation now under discussion in Washington \nwill affirm in its final version the impor tance of these regiona l responsibilities.  \nIt is our job as the regional  headquarters of the nation’s cen tral bank to serve as the link \nbetween our communities and national policy de liberations. Although these policy issues are \nalways important to our nation, today we find ourselves at a uni que and difficult point. We are \nattempting to support an economic recovery, but in doing so, also avoid fostering the next crisis. \n\n \n2 \n It is this challenge that I would like to spend the next few minutes disc ussing and sharing with \nyou my views.  \n \nEconomic outlook \n At this point, the U.S. economy appears on th e path to recovery. Subject to the risks I will \ndiscuss a bit later, the general outlook is good. GDP grew at nearly a 4 percent pace in the \nsecond half of last year, after bottoming out last summer. I anticip ate growth will be slower this \nyear, coming in between 3 and 3½ percent.  \nWhat is perhaps most encouraging now is the changing composition of growth that we \nare seeing. Last fall, a good porti on of the GDP growth could be traced to temporary factors \nrelated to fiscal stimulus and inventory adjust ments by firms that had scaled back during the \nworst of the recession. At that time, there was co nsiderable uncertainty about what might happen \nonce these temporary factors subsided. However, mo re recent data suggest that the recovery is \nmore broad-based and self-sustaining, and perhaps even stronger than anticipated.  \nConsumer spending, which makes up more than  70 percent of GDP, has been expanding \nat a solid pace. While consumers have been cautious  about big-ticket purcha ses, we’re starting to \nsee some signs that this is changing as cons umer confidence improves. Manufacturing activity \ncontinues its sharp rebound, and nonmanufacturing activity has been expanding as well. With \nbusinesses seeing a recovery in  demand, business purchases of equipment and software have \nbeen robust.  \nJobs, of course, remain a critical issue.  Improvements in labor markets boost household \nincome prospects and enables Americans to take  care of themselves and their families and to \nsave for their future. So of course jobs are a cr ucial component in the tran sition to self-sustaining \ngrowth. We are now seeing clear signs that the process of job creation is taking hold. Payrolls \n\n \n3 \n have risen in each of the first four months of th is year. In April, payrolls increased by a strong \n290,000. The recent uptick in the unemployment rate from 9.7 to 9.9 percent actually reflects an \nimproved outlook, as workers who dropped out of the job market are gaining confidence and \nbeginning to reenter the workforce. Solid job ga ins in the months ahead will translate into a \ndownward trajectory for the unemployment rate  later this year and into next year.  \nNevertheless, while the economy is improvi ng, recovery in certain sectors will be \nprolonged. Notably, the constructio n industry has yet to convinci ngly turn the corner. The \nresidential housing market re ceived a boost from federal home buyer tax credits last fall and \nagain this spring, but given the overhang of uns old homes, building activity will remain subdued \nthrough most of this year or longer. Nonresidential  construction will likely  continue to contract \nthis year, due to high vacancy rates in that sector. These ar e important negatives but by \nthemselves should not de rail the recovery.   \nLooking at the economy more broadly, inflati on has drifted lower in recent months, \nwhich is typical following a rece ssion. While energy prices have kept consumer price inflation \naround 2 percent, inflation in non-food and non-ener gy prices – which is core inflation – has \nbeen running at rates of around 1 percent. These infl ation rates are likely to continue for the next \nyear or so. However, as the economic recove ry continues or picks up momentum, I expect \ninflation to drift higher. \nAs for risks to this outlook, th ere are several. The fluid situ ation in Greece and Europe \nreminds us to be wary. The European debt prob lems have increased uncertainty and a renewed \naversion to risks, and are causing in vestors to flee riskier assets su ch as stocks and junk bonds for \nsafer assets such as U.S. Treasury debt. These shifts will have a modest negative net effect on U.S. economic growth in the near term. As an aside, I would note this episode illustrates the \n\n \n4 \n longer run danger of running persistent budget defic its – a situation that we  must soon address in \nthe United States.  \nMonetary Policy \nIt is within the context of this outlook and its longer run implications that the Federal \nOpen Market Committee must balance its objec tives of supporting short-run economic growth \nand long-run stable growth and lo w inflation. It also is within the context of this outlook and \nthese objectives that policy must be normalized, as reflected in the level of real interest rates and \nthe size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s combined balance sheet.  \nAchieving such multiple objectives requires de ft handling. But most certainly, the first \nstep toward a more normal policy is to move policy rates off zero, back  toward neutral.  \nIn saying this, I have no illusions about the challenges of moving away from zero. But in \nmy judgment, the process should begin sooner to avoid the danger of having to over compensate \nlater, as so often happens in policy.   \nI would begin the normalization of policy by ou tlining for the public a two-step process: \nFirst, the Federal Reserve would continue to unwind its extraordinary policy actions \nimplemented as a response to the financial turm oil that began in the fall of 2008. The market’s \nneed for these facilities has eas ed and we have closed most of them, returning the discount \nwindow to more normal operations. As part of this  first step, the FOMC w ould also eliminate its \ncommitment to maintaining “exceptionally low leve ls of the federal funds rate for an extended \nperiod.” \nSecond, with these steps taken, with the improve ments in market cond itions and liquidity, \nand with an improving outlook, the FO MC would be prepared to rais e the funds rate target to 1 \n\n \n5 \n percent by the end of summer. This would cont inue the current high ly accommodative policy, \nbut would move nominal rates away from zero and real rates to a less negative level.   \nWe would then pause, maintaining the funds  rate at 1 percent while we assess the \neconomic outlook and emerging financial conditions . This would provide time to judge whether \nand to what degree further policy adjustments are warranted to assure long-run financial \nequilibrium and stability.  \nBased on the current outlook consensus, it s eems reasonable that the economy would be \nwell-positioned to acc ept this modest increase in the funds rate. As a reminder, the funds rate \ntarget remained between 1 and 2 percent even after the intensification of the crisis in the fall of \n2008. It was reduced to its current target ra nge of zero to ¼ percent in mid-December 2008. \nRelative to the depths of the crisis, conditions today are much improved from where we were 18 \nmonths ago. Financial stress is clearly reduced  and a sustainable economic recovery appears \nunder way. It is also important to emphasize that th e 1 percent fed funds rate target, coupled with \nthe Federal Reserve’s large balance sheet, provid es an extraordinarily accommodative monetary \npolicy environment and one that would ensure th e economy’s continued progress in the recovery. \nSetting out such a plan would be a more orderly move toward unwinding the earlier \nextraordinary actions and would serve to reduce the likelihood of a buildup of new financial \nimbalances.  \nLet me turn now to the subsequent steps that might be taken to more fully restore policy \nto a long-run equilibrium policy le vel. Given the relatively modest expected trajectory of growth \nand inflation, these added moves will involve some quarters to complete. But the direction \nshould be firmly established now with the timing dependent on the performance of a \ncombination of financial, infla tion and growth variables. Expe rience tells me that a clear \ncommitment now to such action would mitigat e the likely need to later tighten beyond our \n\n \n6 \n estimate of neutral that so ofte n comes with delay. More specifi cally, these next steps involve \nraising the funds rate from 1 to above 3 percent reasonably quickly as we gain confidence that \nGDP and employment are on a steady path toward potential. The final steps would take rates to \nbetween 3.5 and 4.5 percent as economic gr owth approaches long-run potential. \nIf we are to achieve a steady rate environm ent, it is also important that the Federal \nReserve's balance sheet be restored  to its pre-crisis size and co mposition. Obviously this requires \nthe careful process of selling the Federal Rese rve's $1.3 trillion portfolio of mortgage-backed \nsecurities. Various approaches to this can be identified but most agree that it should be done with \nthe process or time horizon clearly set out for all to  see. I also would suggest it begin at least \nwhen the fed funds rate rises above 1 percent or sooner if conditions provide the opportunity. \n \nMonetary Policy and Unemployment \nFinally, I want to spend a few minutes suggesting why it is important to move the federal \nfunds rate off of zero even though the unemploymen t rate remains above 9 percent. It has been \nargued, with some supporting evid ence, that the Federal Reserve’s commitment to very low \ninterest rates in 2003 and 2004 was too low for t oo long and contributed to the housing and credit \nboom and subsequent busts.  \nBetween August 2002 and January 2005—two-and -a-half years—the federal funds rate \nwas below the rate of core inflation. Such lo w interest rates encourage borrowing and a buildup \nof debt, sometimes in ways we do not fully appr eciate until much later with the benefit of \nhindsight. In addition, low interest  rates – especially with a commitment to keep them low – led \nbanks and investors to feel “saf e” in the search for yield, which involves investing in less-liquid \nand more risky assets. In addition, financial inst itutions often search fo r yield by increasing the \namount of assets supported by each dollar of net worth – leverage. For example, leverage at \n\n \n7 \n securities broker dealers rose dramatically. After averaging just 13-1/4 between 1970 and 2000, \nleverage climbed to a high of 40 in the third qua rter of 2007 – the start of the financial crisis. \nIt was after a period of too-low interest rates, too much credit , too much leverage that the \ncollapse of the housing bubble, the rapid delevera ging and the ensuing financial crisis occurred. \nAnd it was after these events that unemployment rose to more than 10 percent and the United \nStates lost 8.4 million jobs. In 2010, we have only gained back 573,000 jobs. \nIn another period, the mid-1970s and early 1980s , low interest rates also triggered an \nextreme swing in the economic cycle. The real fe d funds rate was kept negative for a span of \nnearly three years, from November 1974 to Se ptember 1977. The low interest rate environment \nled initially to a drop in the une mployment rate. But rising infla tion and asset bubbles eventually \ndictated a restrictive moneta ry policy implemented by Fed Ch airman Paul Volcker and his \nFOMC colleagues. In the end, the nation paid a high price for the low rates of the 1970s, when \nunemployment reached 10.8 percent in  the recession of the early 1980s. \nIn the drive to achieve price stability and stable growth, monetary policy is a powerful \ntool. Certainly lowering interest rates is the appropriate monetary  policy response to the onset of \nan economic recession and rising unemployment. But it is also a blunt instru ment that has a wide \nset of intended but also un intended consequences that can and have worsened economic \noutcomes including misallocation of precious res ources, inflation and long-term unemployment. \nThat is why we want to return  to a sustainable long-term equi librium policy rate, starting soon. \nThe economy is improving and policy should reflect  that fact, carefully but confidently. \nAlthough we find ourselves in a unique environment,  history offers us some important lessons. If \nwe do not learn from past mistakes, we w ill find ourselves repeating them yet again."

            "content": "May 10, 2010 \n \n \n \n  The Honorable Senator Maria Cantwell 511 Dirksen Senate Office Building  \nWashington, DC 20510  \n The Honorable Senator John McCain 241 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 \n \nDear Senators Cantwell and McCain:   \nAfter the collapse of a large segment of th e American banking system and its contribution \nto the Great Depression, Congress passed several la ws designed to assure that the United States \nwould not experience such turm oil again.  The Federal Reserve Act was enhanced and the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act was adopted to place an expanded safety net around commercial \nbanks, recognizing their importance to financial and economic stability.  Congress also passed \nthe Glass-Steagall Act with the specific inten tion to limit or prohibit commercial banks’ \nexposure to activities judged to hold risks incompatible with  this safety net.    \n \nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 removed several key provisions of Glass-Steagall, \nratifying a growing consensus that it was no longe r necessary to impose such a separation of \ncommercial and investment banking.  To me, it s eems hardly a coincide nce that less than a \ndecade after its repeal, our nati on suffered the most significant financial and economic turmoil \nsince the Glass-Steagall Act was put in place in 1933.   \n \nWe have come full circle.  With the most r ecent financial crisis, we are reminded that \ncommercial banks are the primary intermediary of the payments system and the trusted guardians of depositors’ funds, and that  this role is cr itical to the nation’s financia l and economic stability.  \nIt therefore necessarily follows that commercial banks should not be “high- rollers,” especially \nwhen risk taking is subsidized and enabled by the public purse.  They should not be investment \nbanks.  Thus, I support current efforts to rest ore the principles underlying the separation of \ncommercial from investment banking firms.   \n \n\n\n \n \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Page 2 \n \n \n In making this statement, I acknowledge those who argue that the entirety of the crisis \ncannot be attributed to the repeal of Glass-Steagall and the passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley.  As \nfinancial markets have developed, some inve stment banking activities have become natural \nextensions of commercial banking and have  helped banks provide a broader and more \ncompetitive package of services to their customer s and diversify their revenues.  These services \ninclude securities brokerage activities and st andard underwriting activities for revenue bonds, \ncorporate debt and equity, and high-quality asset-b acked securities.  I also would agree that some \nlong-standing activities allowed for commercial banks actually contribu ted to the crisis.  \nSubprime mortgaged-backed securities  were at the heart of the crisis and, for the most part, were \ninstruments that banks could buy and sell under thei r traditional powers to hold investment grade \nsecurities.  The fact is that like all crises, this one can be attribut ed to a failure of management to \nunderstand the risks they were taking on and to ignoring the signs of incr eased risks within the \nfinancial industry.     \nThat said, the crisis most certainly reflects th e harsh reality that the activities and cultures \nof the more protected commercia l bank and the more highly risk-o riented investment bank have \nbecome closely intertwined. Investment banking ac tivities change the incentive structure and the \nculture in banking organizations to  encourage more of a trading- based, risk-taking environment – \nmuch like we have seen in recent years.  Moreover, the leverage supporting these activities magnify the risks to both, which is incompatible with the protections and subsidies that come \nfrom having access to the safety net.   \n \nConsequently, I have long supported the positi on for reinstating Gla ss-Steagall-type laws \nto separate the higher risk, often more leverage d, activities of investment banks from activities \ntied to the nation’s payments system and related role of trusted intermediary of the commercial \nbanking system.  Experience tells us that so long  as investment and commercial banks mix high-\nrisk activities with those that ar e afforded government protections, then inevitably, elevated risk, \nfinancial vulnerability, and unstable markets will be  the result.  Most tragically then, we find it \nnecessary, inevitably, to bail out undeserving firms.   \n \nThe Volcker Rule represents a good starting point for the discussion.  It offers the \nopportunity for a systematic review to define t hose institutions that by their franchise should \nhave access to the safety net from those that should not.  We cannot con tinue down a path in \nwhich the incentive for a financial firm is to become so large or so complicated that when a fatal \nmistake is made, we are all too frightened to allow its failure. \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Page 3 \n \n \nFinancial reform is essential to address thes e issues.  Unfortunately, the debate has been \nfar more political than analyt ical.  The ideas that surrounde d Glass-Steagall, FDICIA, the \nMonetary Control Act, a nd interstate banking were subjected to  critical analyt ical scrutiny, and \nlawmakers had some idea, albeit im perfect, of what needed to be done.  A substantive debate is \nnecessary if we are to determine and agree upon what approaches will be effective, while \npreserving a profitable, competitive, and innovative financial system that supports rather than \njeopardizes the U.S. economy.  To proceed with out considering the ramifications and unintended \nconsequences of leaving investment banking comingled with commercial banking is a \nprescription for failure.   \nSincerely, \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident"

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nbefore the  \nHouse Financial Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee  \nUnited States House of Representatives \n \nMay 6, 2010 \n \n\n1 \n Introduction \nChairman Moore, ranking member Biggert, and members of the committee.  \nAmong the factors that contributed to this recen t financial crisis, there is no question that \nleverage was key. And the unwinding of this levera ge contributed to the escalation of this crisis \ninto the worst recession in 75 years, hur ting Americans at all economic levels. \nI have spent more than 36 years at th e Federal Reserve deep ly involved in bank \nsupervision, and it has been apparent to me for some time that our nation’s financial institutions must have firm and easily understood leverage requirements. Leverage te nds to rise when the \neconomy is strong as investors and lenders forget past mistakes a nd believe that prosperity will \nalways continue. If we don’t institute rules now to  contain leverage, anothe r crisis is inevitable. \nMy written testimony addresses the systematic  increase in debt and leverage that has \noccurred in all major sectors of our economy over the past two decades. My comments today, \nhowever, will focus specifically on what occurred at the largest financial firms—which were the \ncatalysts for this crisis. \nLeverage is the ability to use debt to build assets as a multiple of a firm’s capital base. \nThe leverage at banking organizations has risen steadily since the mid-1990s, but was not \nimmediately obvious because of the many different ways capital and leverage can be measured. \nIn my judgment, the most fundame ntal measure of a financial inst itution's capital is to exclude \nintangible assets and prefe rred shares and focus only on ta ngible common equity—that is \nownership capital actually availa ble to absorb losses and meet  obligations. Looking at tangible \ncommon equity, you see that levera ge for the entire banking industry rose from $16 of assets for \neach dollar of capital in 1993 to $25 for each dollar of capital in 2007. More striking perhaps, \nthis aggregate ratio was driven most significantly  by the 10 largest banking companies. At these \nfirms, assets rose from 18 times capital to 34 over the same period, a nd that does not include \ntheir off-balance sheet activities. \nThese numbers, in my opinion, reflect two esse ntial points. First, that based on capital \nlevels, the 10 largest banking organizations carri ed fundamentally riskier balance sheets at the \nstart of this crisis th an the industry as a whole. Second, their greater leverage reflects a \nsignificant funding cost advantage.  Not only is debt cheaper than  equity, but their debt was \ncheaper than for smaller organizations because cr editors were confident these firms were too big \nto be allowed to fail. \n\n \n This was a gross distortion of the marketpl ace, providing these firms an advantage in \nmaking profits, enabling them to build size, and the n, in the end, leaving others to suffer the pain \nof their collapse. This is not cap italism, but exploitation of an unearned advantage. And the list \nof victims is long, including families who lost ho mes, workers who lost jobs, and taxpayers who \nwere left to pay the tab. \nThis increase in leverage in the banking indus try spread broadly to the other sectors of \nthe economy, creating a general excess of credit gr owth over the past 10 y ears, especially among \nconsumers. \nThis economy-wide rise in leverage was base d on the assumption that asset prices would \ncontinue to rise, especially t hose in housing. When prices fell and defaults and losses mounted, \ncapital ratios that had been systematically reduced over time proved grossly inadequate. To \nillustrate, suppose the 10 largest banking organizations had been required to confine their \nleverage to a historically more reasonable le vel of $15 of tangible asse ts for every dollar of \ntangible common equity rather than the $34 they had. Under this historically limit, they would \nhave been forced to hold an additional $326 bi llion of equity, 125 per cent more than they \nactually had, to absorb potential losses, or they could have cut b ack on their growth by nearly $5 \ntrillion, or more likely, some combination. \nThe point is that institutions got away from the fundamental principles of sound \nmanagement. And those institutions with the high est leverage suffered the most. Financial panic \nand economic havoc quickly followed. The process of deleveraging is underway, rebuilding capital has begun, but during this rebuilding loan s are harder to get, which is impeding the \neconomic recovery.  \nWith this very painful lesson fresh in our minds, now is the time to act. I strongly support establishing hard leverage  rules that are simple, understandable and \nenforceable and that apply equally to all banking organizations that operate in the United States. \nAs we saw in the years before the crisis, leverage tends to rise during economic expansions as \npast mistakes are forgotten, and pressure for growth and higher return on equity mounts. \nStraightforward leverage and underwriting rules requi re bankers to match increases in assets with \nincreases in capital and prevent disputes with ba nk examiners over “interpretations” of the rules. \nAs a result, excess is constrained, and a countercyclical force is  created that moderates booms \nand forms a cushion when the next recession occurs.  \n\n \n I firmly believe that had such rules been in  place, we would have been spared a good part \nof the tremendous hardship the American people have gone through during the past two years.  \nCritics of more conservative capital ratios say this will restrict growth. Yes, it will. The \nsuccess of the U.S. economy is not the result of the size of financia l institutions but  the strength \nof the financial system. I would be  pleased to answer your questions. \n \n\n \n  \n     \nLeverage: The Double-Edged Sword \n \nWritten Statement of \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nbefore the  \nHouse Financial Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee  \nUnited States House of Representatives \n \nMay 6, 2010 \n \n\n1 \n Introduction \nChairman Moore, ranking member  Biggert, and members of the committee.  Thank you for \nthe opportunity to testify at  this timely hearing.  \nThe financial panic of 2008 created th e worst recession since the 1930s, sending \nunemployment soaring to 10 percent and dramati cally changing the lands cape of our financial \nsystem. While many factors were responsible fo r creating this crisis, there is no doubt that \nexcessive debt and leverage was a major contributor.  \nLeverage, the ability to use debt to build assets  as a multiple of a firm’s capital base, is a \ndouble-edged sword. Credit is obviously essential to  an economy’s growth and prosperity. But \nwhen a tower of debt is built on a foundation of weak  capital, the inevitable outcome is a collapse \nand loss of national wealth.  \n Following this most recent crisis, lawmaker s and regulators are exam ining the issues of \ndebt, leverage and financial stre ngth. We are at a crossroads. Th e country must again review and \ndefine an acceptable leverage profile for our economy and specifically for financial institutions. \nDefining leverage standards too ti ghtly inhibits growth. Defining them too loosely invites excess \nrisk and crisis.  \nMy views on this topic are based on 36 years of broad experience in the Federal Reserve. \nAs head of bank supervision for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the 1980s, I saw the \ndamage caused nationally and locally by excessive  leverage and bank failures—both small and \nlarge. As President of our Bank over the past 18 years, I’ve witnessed th e anguish of individuals \nand businesses as they struggled to manage th e downside effects of too much leverage.  \n  \nTrends \nOver the past two decades there has been a syst ematic increase in debt and leverage within \nthe United States, involving all major sectors of th e economy. The charts I have included with my \nstatement show asset-capital and debt-income ratios increasing annually across all sectors, rising to \nlevels well above long-run trend lin es. In hindsight most agree this  build up was ex cessive and the \nmarkets and the regulators should have seen the crisis coming. But they didn’t. \n  There are three components that we must l ook at in judging the safety of any level of \nleverage: the quality of assets, th e quality of capital and the amount of capital. While asset quality \nis important, it is the quality and amount of cap ital that gets a company through unexpected asset \n\n2 \n problems encountered during the course of business.  For that reason, I will focus my attention here \non the quality and amount of capital.  \nStockholder tangible common equity is the stro ngest form of capital. It is immediately \navailable to meet creditor obligations and absorb  losses. Fundamentally, this is what defines a \nmeaningful measure of leverage. Other measur es of capital include different hybrid debt \ninstruments or intangibles that attempt to acc ount for potential value and future earnings. For \nexample, goodwill is an intangible that is not imme diately available and evaporates quickly when a \nfirm encounters asset problems. Tr ust preferred stock is a hybrid-deb t instrument that carries cash \nflow demands over the life of the instrument. Thus , I measure leverage as a firm’s total tangible \nassets measured against tangible common equity. \nThe leverage at banking organizations has been rising steadily since the mid-1990s. The \nincrease, however, is not immedi ately obvious because of the differe nt ways capital and leverage \ncan be measured (Chart 1). For example, in 2007 just before the crisis began, leverage for all \nbanking organizations based on total equity capi tal, which includes common equity, perpetual \npreferred stock, and goodwill and other intangible assets, was the same as it was in 1993, $13 of \nassets for each dollar of capital.  \nThe story is quite different when you fo cus on tangible common equity by excluding \nperpetual preferred stock and goodwill and other intangi ble assets. Tangible total assets rose from \n16 times tangible common equity in 1993 to a mu ltiple of 25 in 2007. The increased reliance on \nlower quality capital in recent ye ars is clearly seen by the large gap among the various leverage \nmeasures in recent years as compared to the ea rly 1990s when all the measures were about the \nsame.  \nMoreover, a closer examination of the distri bution of leverage acro ss firms of different \nsizes shows that almost all of th e increase in leverage is due to  the largest banking organizations \n(Chart 2). For the 10 largest banking companies, leverage based on tangibl e common equity almost \ndoubled from 18 in 1993 to 34 in 2007, and this doesn ’t include their off-ba lance sheet activities. \nFor the rest of the industry, leverage rose from 14 to just 17 (Chart  3). I would also note that for \nbroker-dealers, which are an incr easingly important source of credit through the shadow banking \nsystem, financial leverage rose from 13 in 1992 to 47 in 2007 (Chart 4). \nAs a result, with twice as much leverage as all other banking organizations, the 10 largest \nhad much riskier balance sheets at the start of the crisis.  The much  higher leverage and greater risk \n\n3 \n exposure of the 10 largest firms cl early indicates that they had a significant funding cost advantage \nover all other organizations, and their creditor s believed they had less exposure to losses. \n  This increase in financial sector leverage fuel ed a significant growth of debt in the \nnonfinancial sector of the economy and, as it turned out, led to a general excess of credit growth \nover the past 10 years (Chart 5). Bank lending rose from 39 percent of gross domestic product \n(GDP) in 2004 to 47 percent by the e nd of 2007, and that figure excludes the rapid growth in credit \nfrom the shadow banking sector and the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While bank loans \nrelative to GDP have declined since 2008, it remains well above the long-term trend.    \nThe increase in leverage and debt was most prominent in the consumer sector. Consumer \ndebt as a percent of personal income generally has been rising since the 1 950s (Chart 6). However, \nit began a rapid acceleration in 2000, rising from 76 percent to 110 percent by the end of 2007.  \nNonfinancial business borrowing relative to nominal GDP also has followed an upward \ntrend since the 1950s (Chart 7). During this most recent expansion, it has increased from 77 \npercent in 2004 to 89 per cent at the end of 2007.  \nFinally, and no less importantly, th e federal government deficit is at record levels and the \ncurrent trend is unsustainable (Chart 8). The incr ease over the past two year s is due partly to the \nautomatic stabilizers that come in to use during a recession and to additional fiscal actions taken to \nrestart the economy. These temporary actions will  add to an already heavy burden of various \nprograms that have sharpened the upward trend with no obvious end in sight. \n \nEffects \nGiven the levels of leverage  in the economy, no one should have been surprised at the \ncollapse triggered by the housing bubble bursting in 2006 and the rise in subprime mortgage \ndefaults in 2007.  \nWhen housing prices fell, many discovered that they had taken on more financial risk than \nthey previously assumed and more than their capit al levels could support. The institutions with the \nhighest leverage suffered the most, and, as it turned out, these were some of the larg est institutions \nin the world. Financial panic quickly followed.  \nWhat started as a Wall Street panic soon crea ted regional distress and finally Main Street \nsuffering. And just like the largest institutions, th e regional and community banks that were most \n\n4 \n leveraged, were most likely to fail. The wave of losses, consumer foreclosures and business \nfailures infected every element of the economy.  \nThe deleveraging process commenced as highly- leveraged financial institutions, working \nwith highly-leveraged consumers and business, had insufficient capital to withstand the financial \nblows. Increasing numbers of home owners were unable to keep up with their mortgage payments, \nleading to higher defaults. Mortgage defaults, in  turn, sharply lowered th e values of mortgage \nsecurities held by financial institutions. These loss es led banks to attempt to reduce their leverage, \nwhich required rebuilding tangible capital and redu cing total assets – thus reducing loans. This \nplaced downward pressure on asset values, losses wo rsened and the vicious cycle of deleveraging \nworsened. Homes and businesses were lost to foreclosure and liquidation, while unemployment \nclimbed. \nThe large increases in levera ge over the past decade have  wrecked havoc on our economy \nand are responsible for the sluggishness of our recovery. Strong economic growth simply cannot \noccur if consumers and businesses must focu s on rebuilding balance sheets instead of on \nincreasing spending, production and hiring of new workers \nOnce again we have learned that the double e dged sword of leverage is a pro-cyclical \nweapon. \n \nConstraining Leverage  \nToday, the largest financial firms are showi ng a solid recovery. Regional and community \nbanks continue to show stress but problems may have peaked as they have worked to reestablish \nstable capital and leverage levels. The market a ppears to be correcting a nd leverage based on high \nquality capital is returning to more historic nor ms. In time credit will once again expand and the \neconomy will improve. But it won’t be quick or easy. Th erefore, we must now turn to actions that \nwill prevent the impulses of consumers, businesses,  and financial institutions from assuming ever \nmore leverage as the expansion becomes a boom. If we take action now, then when the next \neconomic correction occurs there will be less devastation to our economy. If we don’t change policy now, then this crisis will be  remembered only in text books and leverage will rise again and \nlead to another crisis.  \nI strongly support establishing hard leverage  rules that are simple, understandable and \nenforceable and that apply equally to all bank s and bank holding companies that operate in the \n\n5 \n United States.  As we saw in the years leading up to  the current crisis, levera ge tends to rise during \neconomic expansions as investors an d lenders forget their past mistak es and believe that prosperity \nwill continue with no end in sight.  Straight forward leverage and underwriting rules are not \nprocyclical, so that as the economy expands and heats up, bankers must match increases in assets \nwith increases in capital, which constrains reckle ss growth. Thus, such rules would serve to limit \ngrowth beyond a prudent level by creating a coun ter-cyclical force that moderates booms and \nprovides a cushion to bank losses when the next recession occurs.  \nFor an example of the power of a hard leverage rule , consider the impact on a ssets and/or equity of \nrestricting bank holding companies to holding no more  than $15 of tangible assets for every $1 of \ntangible equity capital (Chart 9).As I noted, at the end of 2007, the 10 largest bank holding \ncompanies held $34 of tangible assets for every $1  of tangible equity capital. If the maximum \nleverage ratio was 15:1, these companies would have  had to reduce their assets by $4.9 trillion (56 \npercent), increase thei r tangible common equity by $326 b illion (125 percent), or some \ncombination of the two.  \nSimple rules also provide examiners with the tools they need to prevent leverage from \nrising and underwriting standards from declining. Without hard rules on leverage ratios and \nlending standards, bank examiners were disadvantag ed in taking actions on rising leverage and \ndeclining loan-to-value ratios because bankers  could correctly claim they were following \nsupervisory guidance on capital leve ls, and their loan problems were very low, while profits were \nstrong.  \nFinally, the rise in leverage in the last cycle was facilitated by the complexity of \ninternational risk-based-capital re quirements. In particular, the Base l I risk-based capital standards \nin place leading up to the cris is provided very crude measures of asset riskiness, which \nincreasingly underestimated risk as asset markets deteriorated. Ba nks also could arbitrage capital \nstandards and raise their risk-based capital ratios by shifting assets to favorably treated off-balance \nsheet vehicles or exchanging  a ssets such as prime mortgages fo r “lower risk” subprime mortgage-\nbacked securities. The Basel II risk-based standa rds, which we were starting to phase in, would \nhave enabled an even greater amount of leveragi ng to occur. These standards, which allow banks \nto use model-based risk estimates for many types of assets, actually suggested banks were holding \ntoo much capital in the months leading up to the crisis. \n \n\n \n Chart 1 \nLeverage Ratios - All BHCs \n \nSource:  FR Y9-C, End of Year \nNote:  Tangible assets/tangible common equity is calculate d as total assets less goodwill and other intangible \nassets divided by equity capital le ss perpetual preferred st ock, goodwill and other intangi ble assets.

I’m pleased to be in New Me xico today, and I extend my congratulations \nand best wishes to the city of Santa Fe on its 400th anniversary.   \nLast week, The Wall Street Journal’s  front page featured an artic le with a headline focused on \nthe “epic comeback” of the corporate bond market. Th e article chronicled how a record $31.5 billion \nin new high-yield, high-risk “junk” bonds came on the market last month and how investments in \nbond mutual funds last year were the highest on reco rd. Thanks to the combination of near-zero short-\nterm interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed securities, \ninvestors are flush with cash. And, as is sometimes the case, cash earning so little is an enticement to \ntake on additional risk in hopes of higher returns.  \nThe bond market is not the only place where we are seeing the impact of cash-rich investors. \nOur contacts within the Tenth Federal Reserve Distri ct have shared anecdotal information suggesting \nthat operators and investors in the Midwest are buy ing farmland and bidding up the price. We’ve seen \nthis in the agricultural regions of our District in th e past, notably in the run-up to the banking crisis of \nthe 1980s. \nEvents such as these, along with new economic re search now coming to light, are beginning to \ndocument a story about long-run risks that are creat ed when money and credit are easy for too long, \nwhen interest rates are near zero, and when fina ncial imbalances risk macroeconomic and financial \ninstability.  \nAs we all know, the last couple of years have been an extraordinary period in our nation’s \neconomic history.  In response to the crisis, th e Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to drive \ndown long-term interest rates and provide direct support to a fragile housing market. This was in \naddition to the steps taken by the administration and the Treasury.  We will long study these events.  \nAlthough we may disagree on the specifics of the actions taken during that period, most agree that \nwithout strong intervention, the outcome would have been dire.   \n\n  2But as the economy turns the corner and we move  beyond the crisis, what about the challenges \nwe now face, and what about policy actions over th e next several quarters?  The economy appears to \nbe on the road to recovery, and we find ourselv es having to face important questions of how the \nFederal Reserve will unwind the policy response to the crisis.  In particular, what are the hazards of \nholding the federal funds rate target close to zero?   The risks of raising rates too soon are clear and \ncompelling.  My comments, however, concern the risks of  raising rates too late.  Such risks also can be \nsignificant but all too often seem more distant and less compelling, and therefore hold great long-term \ndanger for us all. \n \nThe economic outlook \nAs a preface to a discussion on the issues, I first should outline my expectation for the U.S. \neconomy.   Policy choices can be realistically c onsidered only after first defining how we judge \ncurrent conditions and our outlook for the future.   \nFrom my vantage point, the outlook is generally good.  A number of indicators suggest the \neconomy has begun to recover and is expanding at a steady pace since hitting bottom last summer.  \nGDP grew nearly 4 percent in the second half of last  year, and growth of almost 3 percent is expected \nin the first quarter of this year.  The pace of gr owth should modestly pick up over time, and looking \nahead, I expect GDP growth of about 3 percent for 2010. \nWhile labor markets remain weak, they seem to have stabilized.  The pace of job losses \ngradually slowed over the course of 2009 and early 2010.  In the first three months of the year, unemployment has remained essentially unchanged at 9. 7 percent. Importantly though, Friday’s report \nfrom the Labor Department showed the largest increase  in non-farm payrolls in three years with more \nthan 160,000 jobs added.   Further, forward-looki ng indicators such as temporary help services, which \nhas grown rapidly since the middle of last year, s uggest broader job growth will continue. This is good \nnews because such progress is essential for sustai ned growth.  And like most, I am following it \n\n  3carefully.   Unfortunately, it tends to lag the rec overy and makes the implementation of policy always \ndifficult to manage during the early stages of a recovery. \n  Consumer spending has been growing at a so lid pace, and most forecasters put first quarter \nconsumption growth at more than 3 percent.  These are critical improvements because consumer spending, which has accounted for about 70 percent of GDP, will be a critical force strengthening the \nrecovery.  The manufacturing sector has followed th e consumer and also has been expanding at a \nstrong pace.  Production has increased at an annual rate of about 8 percent since hitting bottom last \nsummer.  In turn, business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up.   \nThese are encouraging signs that the forces n ecessary for a sustained recovery seem to be \nmoving into place and that this is not just a temporary boost from the fiscal stimulus package and \nsharp slowing in the pace of inventory liquidation.  \nResidential and non-residential construction continues to struggle, although to varying \ndegrees.  Residential construction spending has falle n sharply in the last few months after a strong \nuptick in the second half of last year, thanks in la rge part to the homebuyer tax credit.  Looking ahead, \nspending should pick up considerably in response to  the extended tax credit and then rise at a more \nmoderate pace after the credit expires.   \nThe picture is considerably bleaker for the non -residential sector.  Private spending fell at an \nannualized rate of more than 25 percent in the last th ree months and is likely to fall further for most or \nall of this year.  There has been an increase in v acancy rates for office, reta il, and industrial space. \nMeanwhile, non-residential property values are down.  The soft market is due in part to problems with \nfinancing.  With many banks facing the prospect of considerable losses in commercial real estate, \nlending remains weak.  \nLooking at the economy more broadly, inflati on has drifted lower in recent months and is \nfollowing the pattern common during and after a recessi on.  While energy prices have kept consumer \nprice inflation at around 2 percent, inflation in non- food and non-energy price – core inflation – stands \n\n  4at about 1 percent.  In the absence of any current cost pressures from tight labor markets or other input \nprices, inflation will likely remain low for the next year or two.    Risks of a commitment to near-zero rates \nWith the economy gradually recovering from a sev ere recession, monetary policy is by any \nmeasure highly accommodative. The key challenge fo r the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market \nCommittee, is the question, “For how much longer should it remain so?” \nThe FOMC statement, issued after several mee tings including the most recent, has said that \n“conditions will likely warrant keeping the fed funds rate, which is our key monetary policy tool, at \nexceptionally low levels for ‘an extended period.’” Th e statement elaborates that this view is based on \n“economic conditions, including low rates of resource  utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable \ninflation expectations.”  \nBy itself, the current state of the economy warrants an accommodative monetary policy.  \nHowever, as the economy continues to improve, risks emerge around the act of holding rates low for \nan extended period. \nI have dissented at the last two FOMC meeti ngs specifically because I believe the “extended \nperiod” language is no longer warranted and I am c oncerned about the buildup of financial imbalances \ncreating long-run risks. \nThere is no question that low interest rates stimulate the interest-sensitive sectors of the \neconomy and can, if held there too long, distort the allocation of resources in the economy.  Artificially low interest rates tend to promote consumer spending over saving and, over time, \nsystematically affect investment decisions and th e relative cost and allocation of capital within the \neconomy. \nToday, as we look back over the past decade, there is a case to be made that too many \nresources were channeled into financial market ac tivities and into real estate construction, both \nresidential and non-residential. Some researchers ha ve argued that keeping interest rates very low in \n\n  52002-2004 contributed to the housing boom and bust.  Exceptionally low rates, while perhaps not the \nsingle cause, played an important role in crea ting the conditions leading to our recent crisis. \nWe now find ourselves with a Federal Reserve System balance sheet that is more than twice \nits size of two years ago.  The federal funds rate is near zero and the expectation, as signaled by the \nFOMC, is that rates will remain so for an extended period.  And the market appears to interpret the \nextended period as at least six months.  Such acti ons, moreover, have the effect of encouraging \ninvestors to place bets that rely on the continuan ce of exceptionally easy monetary policy.  I have no \ndoubt that many on Wall Street are looking at this as a rare opportunity.    \nThese actions are not taken to enrich one group over another.  They are taken with the well \nintended purpose of assuring a strong economic recovery  and to create an environment of sustained \njob growth and strong business investment.  I take no  exception to this goal.  However, the unintended \nnegative consequences of such actions are real and severe if the monetary authority goes too long in \ncreating such conditions.   \nLow rates, over time, systematically contribut e to the buildup of financial imbalances by \nleading banks and investors to search for yield.  The Wall Street Journal  article tells a story about the \nmarket coming back that also makes my point.  The search for yield involves investing in less-liquid \nassets and using short-term sources of funds to in vest in long-term assets, which are necessarily \nriskier.  Together, these forces lead banks and inv estors to take on additional risk, increase leverage, \nand in time bring in growing imbalances, perhaps a bubble and a financial collapse. \nI make no pretense that I, or anyone, can reliably identify and “prick” an economic bubble in a \ntimely fashion.  However, I am confident that holding rates down at artif icially low levels over \nextended periods encourages bubbles, because it encour ages debt over equity and consumption over \nsavings.  While we may not know where the bubbl e will emerge, these conditions left unchanged will \ninvite a credit boom and, inevitably, a bust.   \n \n \n\n  6What next? \nSo, what options are available to policymakers? I appreciate the inclination for staying the course that financial markets have come to expect:  \nkeeping the federal funds rate target near zero and maintaining a commitment to very low rates for an \nextended period of time.  That view is motivated by  concerns over an unemployment rate of nearly 10 \npercent and persuaded by the fact that co re inflation remains below 2 percent.  \nContinuing with current policy may also refl ect confidence that the longer-term risks of \nfinancial imbalances are quite small and could be mitigated as they emerge.  The Federal Reserve \ncould correct imbalances through in terest rate action or regulatory changes as the imbalances become \napparent later. \nHowever, in times of uncertainty policym akers tend to reassure themselves that an \naccommodative course of action can be reversed always  in a timely fashion.  Inevitably, though, the \npolicy bias is to delay, to let accommodative conditi ons stand, and to reverse only when the economy \nis beyond recovery and into an expansion.  The ou tcome too often is greater inflation, significant \ncredit and market imbalances, and an eventual financial crisis. \n An alternative policy option is to be more proactive, but cautious.  This would require \ninitiating a reversal of policy earlier in the recove ry while the data are still mixed but generally \npositive.  Small reversals in rates would leav e policy highly accommodative and supportive of our \neconomy’s recovery but would put more weight on mitigating the risk of longer-run financial \nimbalances.  It would end the borrowing subsidy more quickly and would moderate credit conditions \nin a more timely fashion.  It would reduce the like lihood that inflationary pressures might build, or that \nfinancial imbalances might emerge.  And over time it would contribute to greater macroeconomic \nstability.   \nUnder this policy course, the FOMC would init iate sometime soon the process of raising the \nfederal funds rate target toward 1 percent.  I would view a move to 1 percent as simply a continuation \nof our strategy to remove measures that were origin ally implemented in response to the intensification \n\n  7of the financial crisis that erupted in the fall of 200 8.  In addition, a federa l funds rate of 1 percent \nwould still represent highly accommodative policy.  From this point, further adjustments of the federal \nfunds rate would depend on how economi c and financial conditions develop.   \n \nConclusion \nAs we look forward from here, I expect that a ll options will be considered and discussed fully \nas we navigate the course of monetary policy.  As we consider our choices, I want to end my remarks \nby emphasizing that I am confident all of us wa nt the best outcomes for the U.S. economy.  The \nFederal Reserve understands its mission of stable prices and long-term, stable growth.  Perhaps \nbecause I have been part of the history of the cen tral bank for these past three decades, I am as \nconcerned about the introduction of instability in to the economy as I am about managing it when it \noccurs.  I am convinced that the time is right to put the market on notice that it must again manage its risk, be accountable for its actions, and cease its re liance on assurances that the Federal Reserve, not \nthey, will manage the risks they must  deal with in a market economy."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n        \n \n   \nAmerican Bankers Association Government Relations Summit \nWashington, D.C. \nMarch 18, 2010 \n \n \n \n \n\nAs a Federal Reserve Bank president, I am  occasionally asked outrageous questions \nregarding central banking and commercial banks.  “Is the Federal Reserve owned by a European \nbanking cabal?”  “How much owne rship of the Federal Reserve do the Rockefellers hold?”  But \nover the past few days, the questions  have become truly outrageous:  \n“Will the regional and community bank model survive in the future?”  Are community \nbanks important? \n“Shouldn’t the Federal Reserve supervise only the very largest bank s and not community \nbanks?” \nWhat’s more, it is particularly bothersome to me that these last two questions are most \noften asked by individuals who ha ve not been in or know what a community bank does. So let \nme answer the question.  \nWhether you are here today representing JP  Morgan or the First State Bank of \nHometown, Kansas, the answer is  the same.  When you cut thr ough the fog, there is no question \nas to the need for and the importance of commun ity banks in our nation’s  financial system. The \nmaps on the screen behind me show that banks w ith less than $10 billi on in total assets hold \nsubstantial market share in much of the United States and hold the majority of deposits in 16 \nstates. Bank subsidiaries of bank holding companie s with less than $50 billion hold the majority \nof deposits in 26 states.   \nAs you can see from these maps, regional and community banks serve local markets, and \nin turn, support local economic  growth. These banks rely on knowing their customer, and \nmanaging those relationships to work with bo rrowers through good times and bad. Regional and \ncommunity banks are also typically locally ow ned and managed, which means they have an \nimmediate and vested interest in th e success of their local communities.  \nYes, regional and community banks also are under pressure from this crisis, and it will be \na struggle for them to regain their footing; but, certainly no more so than that for our largest institutions that received significant government support. Commercial real estate will be a drag \non earnings for some quarters yet, and there w ill be bank failures.  But this segment of the \nindustry will recover and its model, with its focus on relationship banking, will prosper as the \neconomy recovers and expands.   \nInterestingly, looking at prelimin ary data, I suspect future analys is of this crisis will find \nthat regional and community banks during the cr isis actually may have done a better job of \n\nserving their local markets and maintaining lendi ng standards. While this group of banks has a \nhigher concentration of commercial real estate to capital, there is evidence that they are working \neffectively, and in some inst ances, more cooperatively than  the largest ba nks with their \nborrowers to work out or reduce losses, base d on their knowledge a nd active monitoring of \ncustomers.  \nSome of our largest banks would be well-served to take a lesson. \nIt is also no coincidence that with breakdow ns in other parts of the marketplace, a \nsubstantial portion of regional an d community banks have increase d their loans to businesses. \nDuring 2009, 45 percent of the banks  with under $1 bi llion in assets increased their business \nlending. \nAnd while it may make some of the largest banks uncomfortable to hear this, regional \nand community banks have managed all this while  operating at a competitive disadvantage.  For \nit is the largest financial firms that have an implicit, recently made explicit, guarantee that taxpayer dollars will be used to pr otect them from failure, regardless  of what risks they assume.  \nIt is only now that we are discussing legislation to address the issue of a special class of the \nlargest firms that we have deemed too-big-to-fail.  This is the one item that must be addressed if \nwe are to have any real competitive equity among all financial institutions.  What is proposed \nmay need to be strengthened, but it is a start.  \nLet me end my remarks by quickly commen ting on the Federal Reserve’s role as a \nsupervisor of regional and community banks, some thing that will soon come under debate in the \nSenate and perhaps again in the House. The strong opposition to removing the Federal Reserve \nfrom regional and community bank supervision, voiced by myself and ot hers from the Federal \nReserve, is not driven by the idea of simply pr otecting our “turf” or saving Federal Reserve jobs. \nThe record very clearly shows that the Fe deral Reserve System has made important \nchanges to its operations when such moves bene fit the country as a whole regardless of the \nimpact on the Federal Reserve. Most notably , the Federal Reserve was among the strongest \nsupporters of Check 21 legislati on, while realizing it would mean the eventual loss of thousands \nof Federal Reserve check processing jobs. The legislation improved the efficiency of our \npayments system, and while it was painful for me  personally to see the elimination of hundreds \nof jobs in my District, it was a step we  had to take to best serve the nation. \n\nIn this case, however, serving the best intere st of the nation does not mean reducing the \nFederal Reserve’s supervisory role. \nGiven the importance of 6,800 re gional and community banks lo cated in almost as many \ncommunities across this country, it  is inconceivable to me that  the Central Bank of the United \nStates would not have a role in  their oversight, through the supe rvision of state member banks \nand bank holding companies.   \nThe Federal Reserve System was designed by its  founders with the go als of it supervising \na broad cross section of U.S. banks, assuring eq uitable access to the Federal Reserve liquidity \nfacilities regardless of institutional size or lo cation, and contributing to  the stability of the \nfinancial system – not only on Wall Street but on America’s Main Street.  It does this job well.  \nIn the crisis of the ’80s, which affected bot h large and small banks, banks supervised by the \nFederal Reserve proportionately imposed the leas t losses on the FDIC when they failed relative \nto banks supervised by other Federal agencies.   \nIn addition, the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision of banks and bank holding \ncompanies provides it critical information on lo cal economies in places such as Muskogee, \nOkla.; Santa Fe, N.M. and Scotts bluff, Neb.  And to answer th e question: yes, our role in \nregional and community bank supe rvision supports our responsib ilities as members of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, by expandi ng our understanding of local and regional \neconomies.   \nStripping the Federal Reserve of its resp onsibility for supervising regional and \ncommunity banks and bank holding companies should be unacceptable to anyone who cares \nabout equity in the nation’s banking system, la rgest to smallest bank, and the nation’s regional \nand local economies. Confining the Federal Reserv e’s supervisory role to  only the largest firms \nwill, I fear, inadvertently make the Federal Reserve the Central Bank to the largest firms while disenfranchising the other 6800 bank s.  The map tells the story.  \nWhen Congress created the Federal Reserve nearly a century ago, it gave us a \ndecentralized system that spanned the continent. The explicit purpose for this structure was to better balance the interest of Main Street ag ainst those of Wall Street.  Recent experience \nconfirms that this structure is as important today as then, perhaps more so. Community banks are important to the banking system and to the econo my, and therefore continue to be important to \nthe Federal Reserve. I have said be fore but it deserves repeating: It would be a tr agic irony if the \n\noutcome of this crisis is a gain in power for the largest firms at the expense of the other 6,800 \nregional and community banks. If so, it would be a win for Wall Street.  \n\nGeographic  Market Share of Banks in the U.S. \n \n \nGeographic  market share of banks over $10 billion \n \nSource:  FDIC Summary  of Deposits (June 2009) \n  \n \n  \nGeographic  market share of bank subsidiaries  of BHCs over $50 billion \n \nSource:  FDIC Summary  of Deposits (June 2009) \n• 69% of total deposits are held at \nbanks with greater than $10 \nbillion in total assets. \n \n• Banks with less than $10 billion in \ntotal assets make up the majority \nof deposits in 16 states. \n• 60% of total deposits are held \nat bank subsidiaries  of BHCs \nwith greater than $50 billion \nin total assets. \n \n• These BHCs own the majority \nof deposits in 24 states. \n \n• Total assets of the largest \nBHCs constitute  83% of all \nBHC assets in the U.S.; \nhowever,  represent  less than \n1% of the total population  of \nBHCs. "

            "content": "Comments on the Volcker Rule  Activity Restrictions \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nMarch 2, 2010 \n \n \n On January 21, 2010, President Obama announced the “Volcker Rule,” as an additional \nreform to his financial reform plan.\n1  Under the Volcker rule, bank holding companies and \nfinancial services holding companies would “no longer be allowed to ow n, invest, or sponsor \nhedge funds, private equity funds, or proprieta ry trading operations for their own profit, \nunrelated to serving their customers.”  The Pres ident indicated the rule is designed to prevent \ncostly risks that could destab ilize the banking system, preclude unfair advantages, and prevent \nconflicts of interest.  This document discusses th e rationale for the Volcker rule and suggests its \neffectiveness could be strengthened by supplemen ting it with traditional, simple, and proven \nregulatory rules, such as higher capital requ irements and concentration limits on nonbanking \nactivities. \n \nHow Volcker rule activities affect banks  \n \nThe Volcker rule is based on the idea that banks have a special role in the financial \nsystem.  They are integral to providing credit and operating the payment system.  As a result, the \nfailure of banking institutions ca n destabilize the financial syst em and damage the economy.  \nThis special role provides the justification for regulating bank and bank-related activities. \n \nSome supporters of the Volcker rule have mistakenly claimed th at restricting these \nactivities is necessary because th ey cause bank losses directly or that banks use insured deposits \nto fund proprietary tradi ng activities.  However, these claims  fail to distinguish between banks \nand holding companies that own banks.  Specifi cally, Volcker rule activities can only be \nundertaken in holding company subsidiaries, a nd the Federal Reserve’s Regulation W places \nbarriers between banking and holding compa ny activities that woul d preclude, among other \nactivities, using deposits to fund Volcker rule activities. \n Although the Volcker rule activities do not affect banks dire ctly, there are at least three \nchannels through which losses due to these activ ities might affect a holding company’s bank \nindirectly.  The channels exist because large holding companies manage activities along business \nlines that traverse legal entities.\n2  The 3 channels are: \n \n                                                             \n1 The transcript is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/th e-press-office/remarks-president-financial-reform .  In \nthe same presentation, President Obama also proposed caps  on the percentage of financial institution liabilities that \ncould be held by any one firm to limit further consolidation in the financial system. \n2 For example, the investment banking business line at JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America all do \nunderwriting, market making in securities and derivatives, and lending. \n\n2 \n  Reputation effects – if a holding company's tr ading subsidiary fails, creditors may lose \nconfidence in the holding company’s bank.  As  a result, creditors could withdraw their \nfunding from the bank. \n Withdrawal of customers that prefer a variet y of services – holding companies are run along \nbusiness lines (as opposed to legal entity lines) to  more easily market to large customers that \nneed a range of services.  Failure of a holding company subsidiary may allow a large customer to be wooed away by a company that o ffers a full line of services.  In such a case, \nthe large customer may wit hdraw business and funding from  the banking subsidiary.  \n Funding from subsidiaries – A holding comp any’s nonbank subsidiaries will deposit their \nfunds and customers’ idle balances in the ba nk.  The failure of the nonbank subsidiary could \ncause a sudden withdrawal of a significant amoun t of funding.  Due to reputation effects, the \nsubsidiary’s failure may make it difficult for the bank to raise replacement funding.  \n \nRisk, conflicts of interest, a nd expansion of the safety net  \n \nAs noted above, banks play a special role in  the economy because they provide financial \nintermediation services and are the critical compone nt of the payments system.  As the financial \nsystem has evolved, banking services also have  evolved beyond the trad itional services of \nlending and deposit taking to other financial intermediation and client service activities.  These \ninclude such services as brokerage and market  making, underwriting new issues of stocks and \nbonds, merger acquisition and advice, and invest ment advice.  However, many large banking \ncompanies have gone beyond intermediation services  to proprietary invest ment activities, which \nare the activities prohibited by the Volcker rule .  These investment activities use the firm’s \ncapital to take greater financial risks that are expected to earn more at tractive returns.  With \nclient service activities, transa ctions are undertaken for the firm ’s clients, while with Volcker \nrule activities, transact ions are undertaken directly for the firm itself. \n \nThe proprietary investment activ ities not only tend to be risk ier than client intermediation \nservices, but when conducted with client activities in a single firm, they can cause conflicts of \ninterest.  For example, a firm that does client trading and proprietary tr ading has incentives to \n“front run” client trades.  In addition, the financial system safety  net (deposit insurance, discount \nwindow lending, etc.) has traditionally been provid ed for activities in th e intermediation/client \nservices category.  Allowing a sing le firm to engage in both cate gories of activities extends the \nsafety net’s coverage.  An important rationale fo r the Volcker rule is to prevent or reduce the \npotential for conflicts of interest and expansion of the safety net. \n \nA modified Volcker rule proposal  \nThe Volcker rule has many advantages.  It  prohibits holding companies from conducting \nrisky activities that can lead to losses for subs idiary banks, create conflicts of interest, and \nexpand coverage of the safety net.  In addition, it reflects, in part, con cerns that deregulatory \nefforts may have gone too far, allowing too much discretion and e rring on the side of \npermissiveness.  While the activities targeted by th e Volcker rule were not a direct cause of the \nfinancial crisis, they contributed to the overall ri sk level in the financial system.  Now that we \nhave seen how destructive a financial crisis can be , many people are ready to be more restrictive.  \nThe Volcker rule can help ensure that the restrict ed activities are not the trigger that sets off the \nnext financial crisis. \n\n3 \n  \nThe Volcker rule should be strengthened, however, by supplementing it with traditional, \nsimple, and proven regulatory rules, such as hi gher capital requirements and concentration limits, \nor additional supervision for nonbank holding compa ny activities.  Some critics have claimed \nthat prohibiting proprietary trading would not be effective because it is difficult to distinguish \nfrom other trading and hedging activities.  Thes e critics argue that holding companies would \nsimply continue to conduct these activities am ong other business lines, such as market making or \nprime brokerage, where the activity (and potentially the risks) are not as easy to identify and \nmanage.  Requiring these other act ivities to be conducted in sepa rately capitalized subsidiaries \nsubject to strict capital and concentration limits  would strengthen the Volcker rule by offsetting \nsuch attempts to “hide” proprietary trading.   \n Providing regulators the authority to im pose capital requirements and activity \nconcentration limits on nonbanking s ubsidiaries would also reduce the amount of activities that \nneed to be prohibited.  Specificall y, private equity investments do not  create conflicts of interest \nand may not be significantly riskier than some ac tivities that banks are allowed to conduct, such \nas leveraged lending.  In addition, given that private equity firms are allowed to purchase banks, \nit seems inconsistent to prevent bank hol ding companies from making private equity \ninvestments.  Strict capital requirements and c oncentration limits on priv ate equity investments, \ntherefore, may be sufficient to  protect the financial system. \n \nConclusion\n \n \nConducting activities such as hedge fund sponsorship and in vestment and proprietary \ntrading in a bank holding company can create problems for affiliated banks and the financial system.  The activities have a risk profile that  can lead to losses in affiliated banks, create \nconflicts of interests among various holding compa ny business lines, and lead to an expansion of \nthe safety net.  The Volcker rule is a reas onable approach for cont rolling problems created by \nthese activities, and it can be strengthened by allowing regulators to im pose capital requirements \nand concentration limits on the nonbanking subsidiaries of holding companies."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n           \nPeterson-Pew Commission on B udget Reform Policy Forum \nWashington, D.C. \nFebruary 16, 2010 \n  \n\n2 \n \n \n Thank you for the opportunity to join you today,  both to attend and to participate in this \nevent on a topic of some urgency. \nThe United States is moving into an era in  which government fina nce  is taking center \nstage.  Fiscal measures taken to bring th e economy out of recession, mounting longer-term \nliabilities for Social Security and Medicare, and other growing demands  placed on the federal \ngovernment have invited a massive buildup of gove rnment debt now and over the next several \nyears. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projec tions have the federal debt reaching an \nunsustainable level of two to five  times our total national income within the next 50 years, which \nleads us to an inescapable conclusion—U.S. fis cal policy must focus on reducing this debt build-\nup and its consequences.  \nIn managing our nation’s debt going forward, it strikes me that we have only three \noptions.  First, the worst choice for our long-term  stability, but perhaps the easiest option in the \nface of short-term political pr essures: We can knock on the cent ral bank’s door and request or \ndemand that it “print” money to  buy the swelling amounts of govern ment debt. Second, perhaps \nmore tolerable politically, although damaging to our economy: We can do nothing so long as \ndomestic and foreign markets are willing to fund our borrowing needs at  inevitably higher \ninterest rates.   Or third, the most difficult and probably the least palatable politically: We can act \nnow  to implement programs that reduce spending and increase revenues to a more sustainable \nlevel. \nI recognize that this last opti on involves hard choices and short-term pain.  However, in \nmy view it is the responsible path to sustai nable economic growth with price stability. The \n\n3 \n \nalternative options inevitably le ad to financial crisis and gr eater long-run losses in national \nincome and wealth.   \nThe question of what combination of spe nding and revenue actions the country might \nchoose is the purview of Congre ss and the executive branch. As a central banker, it is my \nresponsibility to anticipate and avoid the conseque nces that an unchecked expansion of the debt \nmay have on monetary policy. It is  a fact that the current outlook for fiscal policy poses a threat \nto the Federal Reserve’s ability to achieve it s dual objectives of pric e stability and maximum \nsustainable long-term growth, and therefore is a threat to  its independence as well.  \nThe founders of the Federal Reserve underst ood this conflict.  They understood that \nplacing the printing press with the power to spend was a formula for fiscal and financial disaster. \nAware of this danger, they designed our central ba nk to be responsible for stable prices and long-\nterm growth, and they gave it a degree of indepe ndence so that it could carry out this mandate.   \nThe goal of policy cannot be to “just get through” the cu rrent challenge, but rather to rebuild the \nfoundation of a stable and prosperous economy, looki ng to our nation’s long-te rm future. It is in \nthis context that I appreciate this opportunity to address what I see as our emerging fiscal \nchallenges. \n \nLessons from History \nThroughout history, there are many examples of severe fiscal strains leading to major \ninflation.  It seems inevitable that a government turns to its central bank to bridge  budget \nshortfalls, with the result be ing too-rapid money creation and eventually, not immediately, high \ninflation.  Such outcomes require either a coope rative central bank or an infringement on its \nindependence. While many, perhaps most, nations assert the importance and benefits of an \n\n4 \n \nindependent central bank, the  pressures of the “immediate” over the goals of the long run makes \nthis principle all too expedient to  forgo when budget pressures mount.  \nGerman hyperinflation is one  classic and often-cited example, and with good reason. \nWhen I was named president of the Federal Re serve Bank of Kansas City in 1991, my 85-year \nold neighbor gave me a 500,000 Mark German no te.  He had been in Germany during its \nhyperinflation and told me that in 1921, the note would have bought a house.  In 1923, it would \nnot even buy a loaf of bread.  He said, “I want y ou to have this note as a reminder.  Your duty is \nto protect the value of the cu rrency.”  That note is fram ed and hanging in my office. \nSomeone recently wrote that I evoked “hyperi nflation” for effect.  Many say it could \nnever happen here in the U.S.  To them I ask, “Would anyone have believed three years ago that \nthe Federal Reserve would have $1¼ trillion in mortgage back securities on its books today?”  \nNot likely.  So I ask your indulgence in remi nding all that the unthi nkable becomes possible \nwhen the economy is under severe stress.   \nIf German hyperinflation seems an unrealistic example from th e distant past, then let’s \ncome forward in time.  Many have noted that in the 1960s, the Federal Reserve’s willingness to \naccommodate fiscal demands and help finance spending on the Great Society and the Vietnam \nWar contributed to a period of accelerating pri ce increases.  Although the Federal Reserve was a \nreluctant participant, it accepted the view that monetary policy  should work in the same direction \nas the Congress and the administra tion’s goals and help finance at  least part of their spending \nprograms.  Monetary policy accommodation during this period contributed  to an increase in \ninflation from roughly 1½ percent in 1965 to almost  6 percent in 1970.  It also helped set the \nstage for the Great Inflation of the 1970s as in flation expectations gradually became unanchored. \n\n5 \n \nLast Friday, I read that an economist at th e IMF raised a question of whether  central \nbanks should allow higher rates of inflation during normal times to give them more room to \nadjust for shocks. While this may sound like a re asonable theory from a credible economist, my \nconcern is that it rati onalizes solutions to short-term probl ems that too often take an economy \ndown the wrong path. \n \nThe Current U.S. Fiscal Imbalance  \nToday, the United States is benefiting from po licies that were estab lished in the 1980s to \nend the Great Inflation.  Conf idence in the long-run stabilit y of the U.S. economy and the \nFederal Reserve’s commitment to price stability  have kept the demand for Treasuries relatively \nstrong, allowing the government to borrow at low interest rates from  its citizens and the rest of \nthe world.  It would be a mistake, however, to take this current ability for granted and to do \nnothing about the mounting debt.  \nWhile the last 30 years have been relativ ely stable—at least until recently—our longer-\nterm history is less reassuring.  From World War II to the present, nominal federal debt held by \nthe public has increased over 30 fold.  And, suppor ted by steady growth in the money supply, the \nprice level has increased by a fact or of 12.  That’s a huge increase in the general price level, and \nit represents a significant reducti on in the purchasing power of th e dollar over time.  These are \nmatters that demand our attention as we make c hoices involving both fiscal  and monetary policy. \nThe immediate concern is the size of the de ficit.  The CBO projects the deficit was \nalmost 12 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2009 and will be almost 8 percent in the current fiscal \nyear—extraordinarily high levels by historical standards.  In th e entire history of the United \n\n6 \n \nStates, the government has run deficits over 10 percent of GDP in only a few instances, and \nusually only during or immediat ely following a major war.   \nAs troubling as these deficits appear, even more disconcerting is the longer-term outlook \nfor the federal debt caused by the accumulation of  these deficits over time.  The CBO’s long-\nterm debt projections clearly show that current fi scal policies are unsustain able.  In one scenario, \nthe liftoff point for federal debt—that is, the ti me when debt starts ri sing without any sign of \nstabilizing—occurs shortly af ter 2020.  By 2035, federal debt held by the public reaches 80 \npercent of GDP—a level only exceeded during and ju st after World War II.  In another, more \npessimistic scenario, the liftoff  in debt has al ready begun, with federal debt held by the public \nreaching 181 percent of GDP in 2035, easily ex ceeding the peak debt to GDP ratio of 113 \npercent that occurred at the end of World War II. \nA key part of the problem stems from rapi d growth in entitlement spending, including \nspending on Social Security and, es pecially, Medicare.  Over the next 30 years, the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) estimates  that the present value of fu ture expenditures on all social \ninsurance programs exceeds future revenue by over $50 trillion. That is nearly four times the size \nof GDP and clearly unsustainable. \nAdding to my concerns for the nation’s economic  prospects is the current level of private \nindebtedness.  As with government debt in th e United States, private nonfinancial debt has \ngrown steadily over the post-World War II perio d, from 40 percent of GDP in 1945 to almost \n175 percent in 2009.  Every consumer and business that is a net borrower would benefit from \nlower interest rates.  And just as noteworthy, it should not escape our notice that rising inflation \nwould trim the real value of their indebtedness.   Thus, high private inde btedness will contribute \nto the political pressure on the Federal Reserve.   \n\n7 \n \n \nThree Paths Forward \nReturning to my opening comments, I see just  three ways forward in dealing with our \ncurrent and prospective fiscal imbalances.  While each involves considerable pain only the third \nwill resolve the imbalances withou t eventually causing inflation to accelerate or precipitating a \nfinancial and economic crisis. \nMonetize.   One option for dealing with a fiscal  imbalance is for the central bank to \nsuccumb to political pressure and monetize the debt .    As deficits and debt levels within a \ncountry rise relative to national inco me, interest rates  tend to rise as well.  In this instance the \ncentral bank is often pressured to keep rates low and encouraged or required to assist the markets \nin facilitating the government's f unding needs.  If the central bank succumbs to this pressure, its \nbalance sheet will expand, bank reserves will  grow, and inevitably the money supply will \nincrease.  This process often appears benign at fi rst, but if it goes on unc hecked, the outcome is \nalmost always higher levels of inflation and ulti mately a loss of confidence in the value of the \ncurrency and the economy.  Walter Bagehot’s famous dictum about banks holds equally true for \ngovernments—once their soundness is questioned, it is  too late.  At that  moment, governments \nand their citizens are forced to make sizeable, painful fiscal adjustments.  \nAn example of both the political pressure that  can be exerted on the central bank, as well \nas the inflationary consequences of debt monetiza tion is currently playing out in Argentina.  The \npresident of Argentina recently forced out the Governor of the Central Bank because he would \nnot transfer reserves held at th e central bank to repay Argentinean debt. Inflation in Argentina is \ncurrently running near 8 percent and will almost certainly increase.   \n\n8 \n \nPolicy Stalemate .  The second path forward  is a stalemate between the fiscal and \nmonetary authorities.  In such a stalemate, the fiscal imbalance grows while an independent \ncentral bank maintains its focu s on long-run price stability.  Although the U.S. government is \ncurrently privileged to borrow at favorable rate s, the fiscal outlook would inevitably undermine \nthis privilege and its risk prem ium on debt would increase.  Al so, as the government competes \nwith private borrowers for funds, th e potential exists for the fiscal imbalance to drive up the real \ncost of borrowing and capital to th e private sector as well.  Eventu ally, this combination of large \ndebt, and high cost of borrowing and capital  weakens economic growth and undermines \nconfidence in the economy’s long run potential.  Sl owly, but inevitably, if  the fiscal debt goes \nunaddressed, the currency weakens, as does acce ss to global financial markets.  And the cycle \nworsens, leading ultimately to a financial and economic crisis. \n An interesting example in this respect is Cana da in the first half of the 1990s.  During this \nperiod, Canadian federal debt increased from about  55 percent of GDP to roughly 70 percent.  At \nthe same time, following a joint agreement betw een the government and the Bank of Canada, the \nBank targeted a steady downward path for infl ation from 3 percent at the end of 1992 to 2 \npercent at the end of 1995.  With no monetary accommodation from the central bank, \nunsustainable government deficits and debt caused re al interest rates in Canada to climb.  While \nCanadian inflation was below that of the United States throughout this period, Canadians paid a \nsubstantial risk premium over U.S. rates to bo rrow.  Moreover, the Canadian dollar came under \npersistent pressure.  Overall economic performa nce suffered, with GDP growing very sluggishly \nin the recovery from the 1990-91 recession and un employment climbing as high as 12 percent. \nThese economic conditions contributed to th e election of a new government, which made \na credible commitment to balance the budget.  In the following y ears, the federal budget deficit \n\n9 \n \nfell dramatically.  Revenue increased, and govern ment expenditures were cut sharply. By 1996, \nCanadian interest rates had falle n below comparable U.S. rates.  Inflation remained subdued, real \nGDP growth picked up, and unemployment fell.       \nEquitable Fiscal Discipline .  The Canadian experience in the second half of the 1990s is \nsuggestive of the third—and the only responsible—way to resolve our growing fiscal imbalance:  \nBy addressing its source in an e nvironment of price stab ility.  All seem to ag ree this is the way  \nwe  would prefer  to go, but of course the devil is in the details.  At the outset, it requires an \ninstitutional framework committed to having an independent central bank.  This discourages the \nfiscal authority from turning to its central bank and should it do so,  strengthens the bank’s \nability to say “no.”   \n  In the United States, the Federal Reserve’ s policies in the early 1980s provide a vivid \nexample of the benefits that arise from the ex ercise of central bank independence. During this \ntime, high interest rate policies designed to lower inflation were d eeply unpopular both among \nelected leaders and the broad public. But the Federal Reserve was able to exercise its \nindependence and pursue long-term goals which sy stematically reduced inflation and changed \nthe psychology of the nation rega rding its expectation about infl ation’s path. As a result, the \nUnited States has had nearly th ree decades of low inflation.  \nKnowing inflation is not an acceptable alte rnative to strong fiscal management, a \ngovernment faced with rising debt levels must pr ovide a credible long-term plan to reestablish \nfiscal balance. The plan must be clear, have th e force of law and its progress measureable so as \nto reassure markets and the public that the country has the will and ability to repay its debts in a \nstable currency.    \n\n10 \n \nTo be broadly accepted, the plan must be seen as  fair, in which there is a sense of shared \nsacrifice across all segments of the economy.  Without being specific, these requirements  \nsuggest an approach in which we are willing to disappoint a host of special interests.  It means, \nfor example, controlling budget ea rmarks, trimming subsidies to numerous economic sectors, \nand resolving our banking problems and the perc eption that Wall Street is favored over Main \nStreet, all of which would otherwise foster mi strust and cynicism among the public.  Leaving \nthese issues unaddressed will undermine the essential popular support required for the tough \ndecisions needed to bring our federal budget into balance.   \nFinally, there are no short-cuts.  We curren tly must adjust from a misallocation of \nresources. There is no way to avoid some short- term pain in fixing the fundamentals in our \neconomy.  It is inconvenient for the election cycle, and it is undeniably terri ble to have at least 10 \npercent of the labor force out of work.  But shor t cuts now mean  people out of work again in  \nonly a few years because we again try and avoid difficult adjustments.  Outlining a credible \ncourse for managing our debt for the future will accelerate the restorati on of confidence in our \neconomy and contribute importan tly to sustainable capital investment and job growth. \n \n Conclusion \n As I mentioned in the beginning, the fiscal  projections for the United States are so \nstunning that, one way or another, reform will occur.   Fiscal policy is on an unsustainable course. \nThe U.S. government must make adjustments in it s spending and tax programs.  It is that simple. \nIf pre-emptive corrective action is not taken regarding the fis cal outlook, then the United States \nrisks precipitating its own next crisis. \n\n11 \n \nEventually, government budgets that are se verely out of balance are inevitably \nreformed—either by force of the markets or, pref erably, by choice. Unfortunately, nations often \nmust experience a profound cris is to focus the government’s attention on ta king corrective \naction.  Usually it is at this poi nt that governments reestablish fi scal discipline and renew their \ncommitment to an independent central bank.  Ir onically, however, these generally are precisely \nthe reforms that would have prevented a crisis in the first place. The only difference between \ncountries that experience a fiscal  crisis and those that don’t is the foresight to take corrective \naction before  circumstance and markets harshly impose it upon them. In time, significant and \npermanent fiscal reforms must occur in the United States.  I much prefer this be done well before \nanyone feels an irresistible impulse to knock on this central bank’s door."

            "content": "The 2010 Outlook and the  \nPath Back to Stability \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Central Exchange \nKansas City, Missouri \nJanuary 7, 2010 \n \n \n \n\n2 \n  I am pleased to be back at the Central Exchange and appreciate once again having an \nopportunity to share with you my views on th e economic outlook and the accompanying policy \nchallenges that we face. When we met a year ago, conditions were bleak. The seizing-up of \nfinancial markets in the fall of 2008 turned what might have been a mild recession into a global \nfinancial crisis. In response , central banks and government s around the world dramatically \nlowered interest rates, directed emergency cred it and liquidity to the financial system, and \nprovided massive fiscal stimulus. Thus, by late spring of 2009, conditions began to stabilize, and, \nby summer, financial and economic distress had eased considerably. \n Today, as we begin 2010, conditions continue to improve, and we appear to be in the \nearly stages of economic recovery, both in th e U.S and internationally. Economic growth has \nincreased, labor market conditions have begun to stabilize, and hous ing shows signs of recovery.  \nEven so, as with other recent r ecoveries, progress seems painfully slow and uneven. Uncertainty \nremains.  \n It is at this point, when conditions ar e mixed but pointing to improvement, that the \nquestions facing central banks a nd governments are the most de licate. They must consider \nwhether to scale back policy in terventions, and how best to return to more normal settings, \nwithout hampering the recovery.  This is no easy task.  Many fear that weaning the economy off \nlarge amounts of stimulus will impede the return of self-sustaining growth and full employment.  \nIt is understandable in this environment that so me prefer to focus exclusively on the immediate \nand wait until the recovery is clearly in  full force before adjusting policy.  \nMy view, however, is that we cannot afford to be short-sighted. We  must more evenly \nweigh our short-run concerns ag ainst the longer-run costs. Experi ence, both in the U.S. and \ninternationally, tells us that maintaining large amounts of stimu lus over an extended period risks \n\n3 \n creating conditions that lead to financial excess, economic volatility, and even higher \nunemployment at some point in the future.   \nIn my remarks today, I would like to share my perspective on these economic risks and \ntrade-offs, and the difficult decision s that lie ahead of us in 2010.   \n \nCurrent Conditions and the 2010 Outlook  \n Let me begin with a brief look at curren t economic conditions.  As you know, last year \nbegan with a severe contracti on in output and employment.  In the first quarter of 2009, real \nGDP fell more than 6 percent and employment declined by nearly 700,000 jobs per month.   \nIn recent months, however, we have s een clear signs of improvement, and many \neconomists believe the recovery is underway. Th e U.S. economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in \nthe third quarter, the first increase in more than a year, and most forecasters anticipate the fourth \nquarter numbers will show even stronger growth. There has been improvement in both \nmanufacturing and residential constructi on. Employment losses have diminished, and \nemployment gains seem imminent.  As we l ook forward in 2010, most economists expect GDP \ngrowth will increase at between 2.5 to 3 percent,  with only modest improvement in labor markets \nand financial conditions.   \nI am more optimistic. I expect that GD P growth, at least through 2010, will exceed 3 \npercent.  To begin, I would note that some expect ations for annualized GDP growth in the fourth \nquarter of 2009 are now nearly 4 percent, after be ing revised up several times over the course of \nthe quarter.  Also, fiscal and monetary stimulus  will continue to provide major support to the \neconomy.  Much of the fiscal stim ulus package announced last year  will have its impact in 2010, \nand it might well be more substantial than initi ally projected due to delays in implementing \n\n4 \n spending programs.  Residential construction is expected to continue to recover with the \nextension of the homebuyer credit program and lo w mortgage rates.  In addition, even as the \nFederal Reserve begins the process of winding dow n its emergency credit facilities, the extreme \namount of policy accommodation mean s that it will still be some time before monetary policy \nwill return to a more balanced level.   The economy’s self-correcting mechanisms al so support recovery.  For example, exports \nand inventories are expected to be sources of strength as foreign economies recover and \nmanufacturers ramp up production to meet  rising domestic and foreign demand. \n As with other recent recoveries, a key elem ent to the recovery in 2010 will be consumers, \nwho have accounted for nearly 70 percent of  total spending in recent years. Consumer \nconfidence showed a rebound during the holiday season, with growth in retail sales exceeding 16 \npercent at an annual rate in November.   Certai nly, there are downside risks that could undermine \nconsumer confidence and spending.  Unemployment  will likely remain elevated, and consumers \nmust deal with lower home equity and high debt levels.  However, attitudes have improved, and \nthis should not be ignored.  I also would mention two additional elements  that will affect the consumer in 2010 and \nrepresent an upside risk to the outlook.  First,  if the economy gains ad ditional momentum from \nthe various spending and stimulus programs, it will al most certainly spur a faster recovery in the \nlabor markets. Second, if manufacturing and othe r business conditions continue to improve, it \nwill encourage businesses to invest in equipment and software, strengthening aggregate demand.  Either of these events would almost certainly further bolster consumer and business confidence \nand spending and thereby contribute to better  overall economic performance in 2010. Both of \nthese, I think, are realistic possibilities.  \n\n5 \n  Those of you who have heard me speak previ ously, both here and el sewhere, know that I \nfrequently point out that consumer  debt levels are too high and th at individuals must save more. \nSo, how does that position align with my statements about the importance of consumer spending \nin the recovery and our broad economy? When I am  asked this question, I think it is important to \npoint out that for decades U.S. consumers consis tently saved more than 10 percent of their \nincomes. However, in recent years, their savings  levels have fallen dram atically, reaching rates \nas low as 1 percent in some years. If the U.S.  is to reduce its dependence on other countries for \ncredit and the support that its private and public  investment demands, savings and consumption \nmust return to more historical norms. But like the decline itself, the adjustment process must \nproceed gradually or we risk disrupting consump tion to such an extent that we undermine the \neconomy itself. The challenge is to esta blish the appropriate pace of change. \n Policy Challenges Ahead\n \n As I have indicated, a key contributor to the economic recovery is the extraordinary fiscal \nand monetary stimulus provided by governments and central banks around the world.  In the \nU.S., we have seen the largest fiscal stimulus in  history with tax cuts, spending increases, large \ntransfers to state and local governments, and fisc al support to financial institutions. Additionally, \nas unemployment has risen above 10 percent, Congress has authorized further spending on \nenhanced jobless benefits.    While these policy actions have been instru mental in helping to  stabilize the economy \nand financial system, they must be unwound in  a deliberate fashion as conditions improve. \nOtherwise, we risk undermining the very economic performance we hope to achieve.  \n\n6 \n In the case of fiscal policy, the ballooning fe deral deficit must be controlled and reduced.  \nIf not, the federal debt will soon exceed natio nal income. As the private sector recovers, \nincreasing demand to finance both public and priv ate debt will likely place upward pressure on \ninterest rates. Eventually, there will be pressure put on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates \nartificially low as a means of providing the fina ncing. The dire consequences of such action are \nwell documented in history: In its worst cases, it is a recipe for hyperinflation. \nAddressing the deficit will be made all the mo re complicated by the fact that many of the \nstimulus programs are scheduled to wind down in  2011 at the very time the Bush administration \ntax cuts are also scheduled to e xpire. It will be an extremely ab rupt shift in fiscal policy from \nstimulus to restraint that will cause the economy to weaken.  Addressing the deficit under these \ntypes of circumstances will be  controversial and desperatel y unpopular. For these reasons, it \nmakes the development of a credible long-run plan to restore fiscal balance all the more critical. \nMoreover, if such a plan is to work, it will i nvolve making some painful choices and important \nchanges in the way we have operated both as a na tion and as a society for some time.  For the \nAmerican people to accept such a transition requires equitable tr eatment and a sense of shared \nsacrifice.   \nIn the case of monetary policy, the challeng es are no less daunting.  The Federal Reserve \nmust curtail its emergency credit and financial market support programs, raise the federal funds \nrate target from zero back to a more normal level, probably between 3.5 and 4.5 percent, and \nrestore its balance sheet to pre- crisis size and configuration.   \nThe process of winding down financial suppor t programs has already begun. Usage of \nthese programs has declined considerably in  recent months, and the Federal Reserve has \nannounced plans to scale back and end many of these initiatives. However, normalizing \n\n7 \n monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s bala nce sheet will be a far more contentious \nundertaking, and there are differi ng views regarding when this process should begin, how fast it \nshould proceed, and what form it should take.   \nOne view is that the Federal Reserve should delay interest rate normalization until there \nis more certainty that the economy and financial markets have completely recovered from this \ncrisis. At that time, the accommodation can begi n to be removed.  Those who hold this view \nbelieve that high unemployment and low inflatio nary pressures due to excess capacity create \nconsiderable economic downside risks if the Fe deral Reserve removes stimulus. Their biggest \nfear is of the “double-dip” rece ssion. In their minds, these immedi ate risks continue to outweigh \nconcerns about long-term  economic performance. \nThis is an appealing argument.  The recovery is in its early stage, and weak data continue \nto emerge in some reports. State and local gove rnments remain under severe fiscal pressures \ndespite considerable federal assistance.  Business invest ment spending for nonresidential \nconstruction and equipment remains weak.  Add itionally, those parts of the country heavily \nexposed to the subprime lending bust and to the au to industry remain depressed.  Also, there is \nno denying the fact that despite improvements, la bor markets and parts of our financial system \nremain under stress.  Thus, while the economic a nd financial recovery is  gaining traction, risks \nand uncertainty remain major deterrents to removing the stimulus. \nUnfortunately, mixed data are a part of all recoveries. And, while there is considerable \nuncertainty about the outlook, the balance of evidence suggests th at the recovery is gaining \nmomentum.  In these circumstances, I believe the process of returning policy to a more balanced \nweighing of short-run and longer-run economic a nd financial goals should occur sooner rather \nthan later.     \n\n8 \n While I agree that unemployment is unacceptabl y high and short-term inflation risks are \nlikely small, we must also recognize what m onetary policy can and cannot do.  Some of the \ncurrent problems in the jobs market are cyclic al and will respond to an accommodative monetary \npolicy.  However, we also have some structural i ssues related to the need to reallocate resources \nfrom manufacturing, construction, and finance to other parts of the economy.  This will take \ntime, and as much as we might wish it so, moneta ry policy is not an appr opriate tool for dealing \nwith structural unemployment problems.  \nAs I have already said today, experien ce has shown that, despite good intentions, \nmaintaining excessively low interest rates for a le ngthy period runs the risk  of creating new kinds \nof asset misallocations, more volatile and highe r long-run inflation, and more unemployment — \nnot today, perhaps, but in the medium- and longer-run.  \nMaintaining short-term interest rates near zero could actually impede the recovery \nprocess in financial markets.  For example, w ith a low federal funds rate and small spread \nbetween the discount rate and rate paid on excess reserves, banks are more inclined to transact \nwith the Federal Reserve instead of with each other. This prevents interbank markets from functioning effectively. Additiona lly, with short-term rates n ear zero, many types of money \nmarket funds have difficulty functioning becau se they cannot attract investors and cover \nexpenses. \nLow rates also interfere with the economy’s ability to allocate resources and distort \nlonger-term saving and investment decisions. Ar tificially low rates discourage saving and \nsubsidize borrowers at the expense of savers.  Over the past decade, we channeled too many resources into residential constr uction and financial activ ities.  During this period, real interest \nrates—nominal rates adjusted for inflation —remained at negative levels for approximately 40 \n\n9 \n percent of the time.  The last  time this occurred was duri ng the 1970s, preced ing a time of \nturbulence1.Low interest rates contributed to excesses. It would be a serious mistake to attempt to \ngrow our way out of the current crisis by sowing the seeds for the next crisis. \n \nConclusion  \nOne of the most important lessons to be lear ned from this crisis is the need for policy \nmakers to properly balance short-run and long-ru n economic considerations.  While we must be \naggressive in our response to a crisis, and remain  patient in the early st ages of a recovery, we \nmust also be resolute in the commitment to our longer-run mission and obj ectives if we are to \nproperly fulfill our public mandate. \nWhile I have focused my remarks today on the economic outlook and macroeconomic \npolicy, there are certainly many othe r crucial lessons that need to be learned from this crisis. \nFor example, there are certainly important re gulatory changes that are needed. In this \nregard, Congress needs to focus on developing fi rm rules that govern fi nancial institutions.  \nRearranging regulatory agencies, which has found some support among policymakers, does \nnothing to improve the rules and standards to whic h financial institutions of any size must be \nheld accountable.  We must institute firm leve rage ratios and basic underwriting standards. We \nmust also limit the speculative activities that commercial banks with access to the safety net can engage in and limit investment banks’ access to this same net.  Institutions that operate with a \nclear mandate and focus, and with clear accountab ility for their actions, will be more competitive \nglobally, not less.  \nOnce appropriate laws are in place, then Congress should hold any agency accountable \nfor the quality of its regulatory oversight. If the regul ations themselves are not strengthened, we \n                                                      \n1 See attached charts.  \n\n10 \n will have no one to blame but ourselves when the ne xt crisis occurs. This would be a truly tragic, \nand unacceptable, turn of events. \nI would now be happy to take your questions.    \n \n  \n\n15202530354045Fraction of Time the Real Federal Funds Rate is Negative\npercent\n051015\n1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s\nNote: The  real federal funds rate equals the nominal federal funds rate minus the core PCE \ninflation rate (measured  from a year ago).\n\n12Real Federal Funds Rate\nPercent\n81012\n46\n202\n‐6‐4‐2\nSource:  Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System and Bureau of Economic  Anal ysis y y\nNote:  The real federal funds rate equals the nominal federal funds rate minus the core PCE inflation \nrate (measured  from a year ao)."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n    \n \n       \nMid-America Payments Conference 2009 \nKansas City, Missouri \nOctober 29, 2009 \n \n    \nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect t hose of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or re presentatives. \n\n \n \n2 \n Introduction \nI am pleased to have an opportunity to join  you today at the conclu sion of this year’s \nMid-America Payments Conference.  We have had a long association with the Kansas City \nClearinghouse, MPX and now EPCOR, as we shar e a focus on improving our nation’s payments \nsystem and ensuring its benefits accrue to financ ial institutions and their customers here in the \nheartland.    \nAs I begin my remarks today, I want to em phasize that I am expressing my own views, \nand they are not those of the Federal Reserve System. \nAs you know, our payments system is going through one of the most radical \ntransformations since the advent of the ACH network more than four decades ago.  The result is \nnot only a payments system that is much more  complex in its operation, but also in the \nchallenges that it faces and th e risks to its integrity.   \nIn response to this evolution, central banks around the world are th inking about how they \ncan continue to maintain an efficient, safe, a nd accessible payments system. In the United States, \none key question going forward is what role the Federal Reserve can and should play in this new \nenvironment. While some in the industry and government advocate a reduced presence, I believe \nthere is a strong case for the Federal Reserv e Banks to continue active involvement. \n \nChanges Prompting Rethinki ng of the Fed’s Role \nSince their founding almost a century ago, the Federal Reserve Banks have played a role \nin the nation’s payments system. Charged with ensu ring its efficiency, safety  and accessibility to \nthe public, this mission remains as important as ever.  \n\n \n \n3 \n The payments system today is very different than the one that was in place in the early \n1900s.  But more striking is how far removed it is from what we saw only a few years ago. \nConsumers have embraced debit and credit card s as the preferred form for payments. Paper \nchecks, when written, are converted to electr onic form and cleared via ACH or Check 21 \nnetworks.  Today, paper checks represent only 2 percent of the total deposited with Federal \nReserve Banks. By the end of the year, the Fede ral Reserve will have clos ed all but one of its \npaper check handling sites. The Federal Reserve he lped drive this move to electronics and the \npublic benefits are clear. For example, the aggreg ate fees paid by financial institutions to the \nFederal Reserve Banks for check collection will  have declined from about $700 million in 2005 \nto less than half that amount by next year.   \nWhile check clearing volume has been declin ing for a decade, ACH transaction growth \nbegan to flatten about a year a go. Whether that represents the te mporary effects of the recession \nor is the result of a structural change, the past rapid growth rates that we  have seen in our ACH \ntransactions are unlikely to continue at such a pace.  \nMeanwhile, debit card transactions have cont inued to increase, even during the recession. \nWe have also seen the growing presence and influence of nonbank providers of payments services. For example, firms like PayPal and Am azon are introducing the capability for software \ndevelopers to apply their front-end payment so lution to make online purchases for specific \nmerchants wanting to control the buying experience. Mobile access to  the Internet is projected to \nexpand rapidly with implications for the positioni ng of financial institutions, telecom networks, \nand technology firms in the payments chain. \nAs we step back and take a broad look at th ese developments in retail payments, it is \nperhaps striking how much of th e growth is taking place in the private sector with little \n\n \n \n4 \n regulatory oversight.  The Federal Reserve and ot her central banks have not played as active a \nrole in the operation or oversight of card ne tworks, the fastest growing portion of retail \npayments.  Many nonbank providers of payments products and services have little, if any, \noversight of their operations. If this continues,  it will create a significan t vulnerability for our \npayments system. \nFor many in the industry, the success and pr ofitability of payments providers is a \ntestament to the superiority of market solutio ns outside the Federal Reserve or regulatory \nenvironment. “Why mess with success?” I am as ked. While in the short term this may seem \nobvious, I want to remind you that this was also  said about subprime lending, complex financial \nproducts and commercial real estate guidelines only  a few years ago. It is the nature of highly \nprofitable private providers to oppose regulation and increased competition. However, in today’s \nenvironment, and based on recent experience, it s eems clear that the central bank will be held \naccountable for the safety and accessibility of a reliable payments system. If consumers are \novercharged or disadvantaged, or if the system  comes crashing down everyone will ask, “Where \nwas the central bank?  Why di dn’t it protect the public and the financial system?”   \nSo yes, candidly, I do question whether the private sector alone can provide a safe, \ncompetitive and efficient payments system over the long term. \n \nEconomic Rationale for a Govern ment Role in Retail Payments \nIn general, most economists believe that ma rkets work well in most circumstances. The \nexceptions arise when there are externalities or other forms of market failure. Examples are when there are interdependencies among market participants  that lead to important spillover effects or \n\n \n \n5 \n when scale economies lead to the emergence of  a small number of industry providers with \npotential market power.   \nMany payments markets have a number of thes e features, and I would like to highlight \nthree that seem especially important in assessi ng the need for central ba nk involvement in retail \npayments.  First, payments markets are networ ks, and economic studies of networks suggest \nthere can be severe coordination problems that may inhibit their growth and development. These \ninvolve difficulties in cr eating standards and in undertaking la rge startup capital expenditures.   \nSecond, because of externalities and spillove r effects, networks may under invest in \nsecurity as individual pa rticipants look first to their own prof itability and do not consider system \nintegrity as a whole. We are all well aware of the recent rise in  major information breaches and \nidentity theft in the retail payments system. I wo uld note that many of thes e instances have been \ncentered at nonbank payments providers.   \nThird, because of scale economies, payments systems and electronic payments systems in \nparticular, tend to have a small number of provi ders, raising concerns about market power and \nnoncompetitive pricing. In the United States, we have seen a trend toward increased \nconcentration in debit card networks, with a decline from 43 debit networks in 1995 to 13 in \n2007. Indeed in 2007, the top three debit card netw orks (PIN and signature) handled 88 percent \nof total transactions and Visa alone had a market  share of almost 64 percent. As consolidation \nhas occurred, we have seen significant increases in interchange fees, a development that has not \ngone unnoticed by the public and govern ment officials around the world. \nIn light of these issues, I think a strong case can be made for continued central bank \ninvolvement in retail payments. The key questio ns at hand focus on the nature of central bank \n\n \n \n6 \n activities and, especially, how these activities shoul d evolve to meet the changing structure of the \nretail payments industry. \nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s involve ment in retail payments has centered on \novercoming coordination problems th at have inhibited efficiency. In this regard, I believe the \nFederal Reserve's position as an operator has allowed it to be an effective catalyst and facilitator for payments modernization.  \nFor example, in the early 1970s, as bankers, re gional payments associations, and the U.S. \nTreasury struggled with the incr easing volume of check payments and related costs, the Federal \nReserve collaborated with the industry to build the automated processing systems and \ndistribution network that would become the AC H.  And, in 1984, the Federal Reserve provided \nthe impetus for industry adoption of another ma jor innovation by applying digital image capture \ntechnology to the backroom of th e check processing business, agai n in response to a need from \nthe U.S. Treasury to reduce the costs of mi crofilming checks it issued.  As you know, this \ninvestment was later leveraged to esta blish check image exchange networks. \nIn each of these endeavors and others, we have worked closely with the industry and \nCongress to develop legislation, standards, technology and proce dures to overcome the severe \ncoordination difficulties that prevented the private sector from moving ahead on its own.  Even today, we continue to leverage our operational role in ACH. For example, we’re working with \nindustry stakeholders to address problems such as how to more efficiently and safely exchange \npayments internationally with lo w volumes now, but growing volumes in the future.  And we are \nworking to introduce faster ACH clearing with  a same day settlement capability, which we \nexpect to roll out in the first half of next year. \n\n \n \n7 \n Finally, I would be remiss if I did not empha size that in times of crisis, the Federal \nReserve’s operator role has served to minimize the impact to public confidence that would occur \nwith major disruptions to the re tail payments system. In the hours and days following the Sept. \n11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Reserve Banks were  in a position to keep the check collection \nsystem operating despite the disruption to air tran sportation. While the proba bility of disruptions \nis low, crises will happen sometime in the future and I believe the Federal Reserve’s operator role enhances the resiliency of our retail payments system. \nIn the future, the Fed’s traditional role of  catalyst and facilitator may be less needed \noutside of ACH. After all, card networks have developed and prospered without Federal Reserve \ninvolvement, and the innovation introduced  by nonbank payments providers has been \nimpressive.   \n \nThoughts on the Federal Reserve Bank s' Future Role in Retail Payments  \nIn my view, a starting point for considering the Federal Reserve's future role is to \nconsider whether the safety and efficiency of retail payments will be enhanced by the central bank’s continuing presence.   \nAs I indicated earlier, it is not  clear to me that the privat e sector will make sufficient \ninvestments to maintain the safety and integrity of  retail payments without some sort of Federal \nReserve or government pressure. Consequently, I believe it is important to ask whether the \nFederal Reserve, as a traditional, trusted provider of secure payments services, can play a role in \nhelping to enhance the security of the retail pa yments system and reducing identity theft. More \nbroadly, I think it is important to consider th e extent to which nonbank providers of payments \n\n \n \n8 \n services pose systemic risks to the retail paymen ts system and to explore how they, along with \ntraditional providers, might be more effectivel y monitored by regulatory oversight programs. \nI also think that the Federal Reserve coul d play a role in enhancing the competitive \nefficiency of the retail payments system by le veraging its operational role  in ACH to provide a \nplatform for clearing all forms of  debit transactions. Note that I am not suggesting the Fed issue \ndebit or credit cards, but rather, that the Federa l Reserve provide a cost effective alternative to \nmoving and clearing debit transactio ns, and as a systemic backup to the private sector – a role it \nhas played in payments since nearly its foundi ng. Such an approach may require additional \ninvestments in and enhancements to the FedA CH network. Some may disagree, but looking \nback, the Federal Reserve’s role in check paym ents did not drive comp etition out, but assured \nbroad, safe access in a more competitive environment, to the payments system.  \nAs I have floated this idea over the past year , I have received feedback from some who \ndisagree. However, we need to think about the ef fects of the likely alte rnatives. As I indicated \nearlier, concern about noncompetitive pricing of payments services and market power have \nemerged around the world. This has led to signifi cant government interventions in market pricing \nand market practices in a grow ing number of countries. The c ourse taken in many of these \ncountries has been to subject the card networks and market partic ipants to greater oversight and, \nin some cases, to direct government involveme nt in interchange pricing. As you know, similar \nbills are pending in Congress. \nMy own view, like that of many economists, is that government involvement in direct \nprice setting in any industry is fraught with problems in implementation, generally leading to \npoor outcomes and unintended consequences. At the same time, noncompetitive market \nstructures and pricing, if present,  do need to be addressed. One alte rnative, of cour se is greater \n\n \n \n9 \n antitrust enforcement. My suggestion is somewhat different, to increase competition via the \nFederal Reserve’s role in retail payments, speci fically as an operator of the ACH network. Of \ncourse there may be other means of making non competitive markets more contestable, which \nalso should be considered. \n \nSummary \nIn summary, the retail payments system is  evolving rapidly and is more complex than \never. It serves as a critical component to the infrastructure of the economy. The Federal Reserve, \nworking closely with financial institutions and the industry as a partner and competitor has been \nan important driver of efficiencies and current le vels of safety and stabili ty. However, the growth \nin payments transactions is now occurring in  card networks, and nonbanks ’ presence is growing. \nSome may call for the Fed to exit retail paymen ts now that physical distribution is no longer \nneeded and its share of retail payments tran sactions is naturally declining. However, \nconcentration in card markets, increased concerns  about security and re liability, the unintended \nconsequences of regulation versus Fed participati on in these markets, and the success of the Fed \nin sparking industry innovation fr om its position on the ground, lead  me to conclude that Fed’s \npresence as an operator is needed now more than ever."

            "content": "Regulatory Reform and the Economy: \nWe Can Do Better \n \n \n      \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n       \nDenver, Colorado \nOctober 6, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n I want to thank you for attending this ev ening’s Economic Forum, hosted by the Denver \nBranch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. When Congress created the Federal Reserve \nin 1913, they believed very strongly that the na tion’s central bank could not be an institution \nisolated inside Washington. Inst ead, they recognized the importan ce of distribu ting the Federal \nReserve’s responsibility broadly across the nation, creating regiona l Federal Reserve Banks that \nserve specific regions of the country. The regi onal Banks and Bank Branches, like the one here \nin Denver, are under the direction of local boards. Our directors pl ay a key role in connecting the \nFederal Reserve and its policy deliberations direc tly to the communities we serve. We have two \nDenver-area directors on the Ka nsas City office’s board, and the seven-member Denver board \nincludes four Denver-area director s. I would like to recognize how  important these Coloradans \nare to the success of our work and thank each of them for their service to our nation’s central \nbank. \n \nCHALLENGES \nIn the past when I have spoken at this program, my comments have focused almost \nentirely on the economic outlook. In that regard, I can tell you that I see nothing that conflicts \nwith the widely held opinion that we are in recovery. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and \nwe are starting to see improvement in busine ss and manufacturing. Addi tionally, yield spreads \nbetween low-risk assets, such as Treasuries, and higher risk assets are na rrowing. They are not at \nprerecession levels, but there is a clear indicat ion that investors are more willing to provide \ncapital, which is extremely important. A vast amount  of stimulus has been put in place to spark \nthis recovery, and I believe it wi ll prevent a double-dip recession.  \nThe stimulus will, however, present its own challenges. The Federal Reserve and other \ncentral banks around the world will have to unw ind the extensive policy accommodation used to \nhalt the economy’s decline. That will be a de licate process because removing too soon could \nreturn the economy to recession while waiting too long will foster an inflationary spiral. The \nprocess will be particularly deli cate for this recovery because it will proceed slowly, hampered \nby a significant debt overhang and uncertainty  around the condition of some of the largest \nfinancial institutions. Thus, the challenge to mone tary policy is to act in such a manner that you \nencourage the recovery while not fo stering conditions for a future cr isis, albeit one of a different \nnature.  \n\n3 \n As policy is discussed and even debated, it is important to note that the current fed funds \nrate is zero. We all know that the neutral rate is not zero. Equally obvi ous to me is that a rate of 1 \nor 2 percent is not tight monetary policy – it is  still very accommodative.  As we consider our \nchoices, I would not support a tight monetary policy in the current environment, but my \nexperience tells me that we will need to remove our very accommodative policy sooner rather than later. Even if we were to start immedi ately, much time would pass before incremental \nincreases could be considered tight or even neutral policy. \nMonetary policy, however, is not the only area where we will have to consider the long-\nterm implications of our actions as we emerge from  this crisis. In that regard, I think the best use \nof my time here this evening will be to explai n why I think the hard decisions are ahead in the \narea of regulatory reform, which is currently unde r consideration in Congress. Looking at some \nof the policy issues that have emerged in recent  weeks, it seems the public debate continues to \ndistract from what I judge was the primary cause of  this crisis. We must address the issue of too \nbig to fail or we will repeat the mistakes of the past, with ever-worsening consequences. I know \nwe can do better. \n \nREGULATORY REFORM \nToo Big to Fail \nReform in the regulation and oversight of our financial system clearly is needed. As sure \nas we know that tomorrow will arrive, we know that  a financial crisis will occur again at some \ntime in the future. Therefore, the most important  exercise that we s hould undertake now is to \nensure that problems at large financial institu tions are not allowed to  jeopardize the basic \nsurvival of our financial system and economy.  \nHow do we do that?  How do we prevent ince ntive compensation schemes that carry high \ncosts to taxpayers? How do we best protect the consumer from unfair and deceptive practices by \nfirms that are currently unregulated or under-re gulated? While the Administration has taken an \nimportant initial step to address these lapses in our financial system, it is focusing first on \nsymptoms rather than the disease.  \nAdam Smith is often thought of as the E nglish-speaking world’s father of modern \neconomics. He is widely known for hi s book titled, The Wealth of Nations\n, in which he provided \n\n4 \n his analogy that a market economy was like an invi sible hand guiding resources  to their best use. \nLess well-known is another passage in  that book in which he warns that: \n \n“The interest of the dealers … is always in some resp ects different from, and even opposite to, that of the \npublic. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is  always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market \nmay frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be \nagainst it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by ra ising their profits above what they naturally would be, to \nlevy … an absurd tax upon … their fellow-citizens. The pr oposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which \ncomes from this order ought always to be listened to w ith great precaution…. It comes from an order of men whose \ninterest is never exactly the same with  that of the public, who have generally  an interest to deceive and even to \noppress the public, and who … upon many o ccasions, both deceived and oppressed it.” \n \nTo get a sense of what Adam Smith is talk ing about, I would point out that in 1999 the \nCongress passed a piece of legisl ation, heavily endorsed by our la rgest banking firms, called the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This le gislation ended the separation of  commercial and investment \nbanking. It broadened the market and allowed for th e accelerated growth of  large financial firms \nin the United States, turning them into institutio ns that were thought to be “too big to fail.”   \nThis should not be dismissed as a populist vi ew of these institutions, but one that is \nsupported by the data. It is best seen by examin ing the advantages that accrued to these firms \nwith respect to their capital levels. The market, knowing these firms were too big to fail, \ntolerated an ever-expanding levera ge ratio, relative to owner equit y. For example, if you look at \nthe 20 largest instituti ons, their equity-to-assets ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was \nabout 4.3 percent. If you look at th e next smaller group of institutions , their equity-to-assets ratio \nwas almost 6.5 percent. The smaller institutions simply must carry lower leverage ratio because \nall those in the market – management, shareholders  and creditors – know they  will lose their jobs \nand investments if they make d ecisions that cause their banks to  fail. This type of market \ndiscipline is less immediate to the owners  and creditors of th e larger firms.  \nIf you were to place these larg est institutions under the same leverage constraints as the \nsmaller firms – at least 6.5 percent equity to asse t – these larger firms would need to raise more \nthan $275 billion in new capital or shrink their assets by more than $4 trillion. This capital \ndifference is an overwhelming advantage to these largest firms and, indeed, has enabled them to \nnarrow the competition to an incredible degree. Si nce the change in law, the largest 20 firms \nhave increased their control of the nation’s banking assets from about 35 percent to an \n\n5 \n astonishing 70 percent. Even more  striking perhaps is the fact th at some of these firms are now \n30 to 40 percent larger than they were when th is crisis began, and as you know, many of these \nfirms were protected during the crisis.  \nWhen the crisis unfolded and these largest fi rms were at risk of failure, Congress passed \nthe $700 billion TARP legislation. It was done to protect the broa d economy, but it also had the \nadditional effect of institutionalizing t oo big to fail in the United States.  \n \nCompensation \nOne of the ironies of this ac tion is that the management of these firms, even those \nneeding TARP funds to survive,  continues to receive enormous  compensation packages. As a \nresult, one of the issues currently distracti ng Congress and the public is executive compensation. \nI certainly understand the anger directed at the well-paid indi viduals atop large firms that \ncontributed to this crisis. However, a comp rehensive plan for resolving these firms and \ndismissing management, rather than protecting them from failure, woul d address compensation \nissues far more effectively because it would leav e these individuals out of  work and wipe out any \nownership stake they hold. That  does much more for accountability than simply capping an \nindividual’s pay. In fact, there is some question if pay caps could even be firmly implemented – \nas you may know some firms have  already begun to work around compensation limits by raising \nbase salaries to million-dollar levels.  \nCompensation restrictions also  call into question the tenants of capitalism in terms of \nbalancing risk and reward. If we ensure that our resolution system makes management bear the \ncosts of the bad decisions and risk s they take, we also need to le t them reap the rewards of the \ngood decisions. At the very least, new kinds of ma rket distortions might be created by injecting a \ndegree of disconnect between compensation and pe rformance – the same kind of disconnect that \nsome might suggest fosters the type of  carelessness we saw in this crisis. \nLet me give you one example. Let’s say one of the largest financial institutions wanted to \npay a trader a $100 million bonus based on performan ce. I’m not a trader, but I know there is no \nway to earn enough money on trading to gene rate a $100 million bonus without taking open \npositions, which in this example is making bets on behalf of a company that has a major role in our nations’ payments system. If the trader wins , the company makes money. If the trader loses, \ntaxpayers fund the bailout because the institution is large and systemically important. The real \n\n6 \n problem with this scenario is that the company is  too big to fail, not that they are willing to pay \nan enormous sum of money as a bonus. If it’s thei r money, or the money of their shareholders or \ncreditors, I am in favor of letting them set compensation levels. If it’s the money of U.S. \ntaxpayers, then it’s an outrage. Mandating an orderly receivership if the institution fails assures that they gamble w ith their own money. \nIt is also important to acknow ledge that policing such an executive compensation policy \nwill be difficult and inconsistent. For those who are angry about individuals profiting obscenely \nfrom a crisis, it will do nothing to prevent that. Many investors did so during this crisis by rightly \ninterpreting that the government wo uld bail out failed inst itutions and that th e stock prices would \nrecover. Heads I win, tails the public loses is a on e-way bet. It’s not capit alism; it is bad policy. \nOnce again, I suggest that ending too-big-to-fail is th e first step in addressing compensation \nissues. \n \nConsumer Protection \nAnother headline issue in the regulatory reform package relates to the proposed \nConsumer Financial Protection Agen cy. Fair treatment of consumers is extremely important. We \ndo a lot of work throughout our District on cons umer education and consumer issues. Our Bank \nalso hosts a nationwide call cente r on behalf of the entire Fe deral Reserve System. Consumers \ncan contact us by phone\n1 – and they will talk to an actual person, not a machine – or online at \nwww.FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov  to discuss problems related to any financial institution, \nregardless of the regulatory agency  involved. These calls are extrem ely illuminating in what they \ntell us about the relationship between consumers a nd financial institutions. First of all, we handle \nabout 40,000 consumer questions a year, which suggests a lot of  concern and often confusion \nabout consumer rights under the law. However, 90 percent of the complaints we receive are \ntargeted on the largest banks and most often rela ted to credit card issues. Very few complaints \nare made against community banks. And, after th ese complaints have been investigated, few \nagainst community banks are actually found to i nvolve violations of th e consumer protection \nrules. This suggests that  clarification or simp lification of consumer protection rules may be \nnecessary for consumers to better understand what their protections  are under the law. \n                                                             \n1 888‐851‐1920 \n\n7 \n I think we also need to recognize that, while effective consumer protection is a critical \nfoundation of our financial system, weaknesses or ga ps in the enforcement of these laws was not \nthe only factor, or even the driving factor , behind the run-up of subprime lending and the \nresulting wave of foreclosures. What we experi enced was a distortion of incentives in financial \nmarkets amid inflated real estate prices, skyroc keting demand for mortgage backed securities and \na resulting deterioration in underw riting standards for many lenders as they rushed to originate \nmore loans. These dynamics caused too many loans to be extended without a reasonable \nprobability of repayment. The consequences were, of course, disastrous when the housing market \ncollapsed. This experience raises important questions about the incentives involved in \nsecuritizing loans, the ab ility of consumers to receive a loan with little or no upfront money, and \nthe role of nonbank firms, among other issues. Ther e are also lessons to be learned about the \nscope and effectiveness of consum er protection laws, as well as the expectations for regulators \nenforcing these laws.   \nThere are more discussions and debates to take place on this topic, and it is the choice of \nCongress to decide. My experience tells me, howev er, that comprehensive oversight of banks is \nimportant for both effective and efficient supe rvision. Under the coordinated approach we \ncurrently utilize, our goal is  to create a good outcome for consumers and depositors through \nensuring a financially sound and well-managed banking operation that complies with specific \nconsumer protection rules. Separating those functi ons will create inefficiencies in information \ncollection and analysis, and add an additiona l layer of communication and coordination.   \nBut in any case, the fact remains that the c onsumer and the public more generally will be \nbest served if we address the root cause of the abuse that many unfor tunate consumers have \nsuffered during the crisis. We must change the incentives and enhance th e accountability of the \ninstitutions that generated the complex products th at served the principle goal of generating fees \nrather than being sound loan products. \n \n Solution \nMany times in the last year I have expressed my astonishment that Congress was able to \napprove $700 billion in TARP f unds in approximately one week and yet 18 months have passed \nsince Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan and there is still no resolution authority for the \nlargest financial firms.  \n\n8 \n Failure resolution for these largest firms and other yet-to-be-defined systemically \nimportant firms is part of the proposed reform package now before Congress. Unfortunately, the \nproposal does not adequately addres s the too-big-to-fail problem in that it still provides too much \nlatitude to rescue failing firms.  It confirms the practice of addr essing failure of the largest firms \nin an ad hoc manner with individuals rather than  the rule of law decidi ng which firms get rescued \nand which do not. As eager as we might be to ad dress the shortcomings of our financial system, \nwe must also be careful to get it right.  Without mandatory resolution authority direct ed under “the rule of law” for the largest \nfirms, financial reform will be incomplete and in effective. Management will remain able to game \nthe compensation programs that we define, and consumers will be subject to higher fees and \nunfair treatment, even under a new regulator, should it come to be. There can be no confidence in \nthe system until there is a sense of fairness in the treatment of institutions whereby management \nand investors are held accountable for their decisi ons regardless of their firm’s size. We all know \nthe names of these firms. They were central to  this crisis as it expanded and became a global \nrecession. However, while the crisis caused workers to  lose their jobs and families to forfeit their \nhomes, the stockholders and creditors of thes e firms enjoyed special protection funded by the \nAmerican taxpayer.  \nTo begin with, the legislati on needs to establis h a mandatory, non negotiable resolution \nprocess for too-big-to-fail firms that are no longe r viable as a going concern due to insufficient \ncapital or liquidity. With appropr iate legislation, failing firms c ould still avoid liquidation or a \ndrawn-out bankruptcy process. Instead, they would be  put into receivership or conservatorship so \nas to provide an orderly pro cess for maintaining essential se rvices and avoiding systemic \ninstability while making management, shareholders  and creditors accountable for their decisions. \nThe resolution process would apply to every fina ncial institution whose problems might threaten \nfinancial or economic stability a nd is involved in the “plumbing” of the financial system – that \nis, those involved in the payments system and the provision of liquidity within the financial \nsystem.  \nA resolution process where creditors bear losses commensurate with their investment \ndecisions would be significantly le ss costly to the taxpayer than th e price we are currently paying \nin lost jobs, lost economic grow th and actual outlays of public f unds. Alternatively, if we do not \nfind a way to end too-big-to-fail, the largest institutions retain an inequitable competitive \n\n9 \n advantage, will continue to escape market discip line and are incented to engage in practices that \nultimately harm the financial system.  \nA sound resolution process would provide greate r assurance of equita ble treatment for all \nparties, which is essential in a democratic, cap italist system. As a nation, we will soon need to \naddress other enormous financial challenges, such as reducing the budget deficit and providing \nfuture funding for Social Security and Medicare. We must not fool ourselves that citizens will – \nor should – accept higher taxes or reduced be nefits until we have addressed existing \nvulnerabilities in our financial sy stem that risk public funds.  \nTo those who say that some firms are too big to  fail, I wholeheartedly  agree that some are \ntoo big. However, these firms can be unwound in a manner that does not cause irreparable harm \nto our economy and financial system but actually strengthens it for the long run. As a regulator \nduring the banking crisis of the 1980s, I was involved in closing hundreds of failed institutions. Continental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest and most complex bank holding \ncompanies, was taken into receivership is an orderly fashion.  \nI have testified before Congress on this issu e and recently offered a detailed process that \nwould hold the ownership and senior management  of these institutions  accountable for their \nactions when their firms fail. The businesses w ould then be restructured through a prescribed \nprocess under the rule of law. If  you are interested in the details  of this plan, I encourage you to \nvisit our website, www.KansasCityFed.org\n, where you can review it in  its entirety. I am not \naware of any other proposal that  would prevent situati ons like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers \nand Merrill Lynch from being handled exact ly the same way. That is unacceptable. \n \nCONCLUSION \n  While some argue that m oving legislation quickly forward gives us a better outcome \nsooner, my view is that this approach will result  in a set of unintended c onsequences with a more \nexpensive outcome. I have no doubt that all policymakers involved in the debate have the same \ngoals of benefitting the consumer, the industry a nd the nation’s economy. That is why I believe \nthe full package of regulatory reform deserves mo re time for careful c onsideration and national \ndebate, but resolution authority is well over a year  too late. The likelihood of real success in \nfinancial stability; consumer pr otection; and; importantly, public  confidence in policymakers’ \n\n10 \n resolve to fix what actually went wrong in our financial system starts by addressing too-big-to-\nfail.  \nI know that this is a difficult problem to fully understand, and certainly will be a \ncomplicated situation to fix.

            "content": "Regulatory Reform and the Economy: \nWe Can Do Better \n \n \n      \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n       \nDenver, Colorado \nOctober 6, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n I want to thank you for attending this ev ening’s Economic Forum, hosted by the Denver \nBranch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. When Congress created the Federal Reserve \nin 1913, they believed very strongly that the na tion’s central bank could not be an institution \nisolated inside Washington. Inst ead, they recognized the importan ce of distribu ting the Federal \nReserve’s responsibility broadly across the nation, creating regiona l Federal Reserve Banks that \nserve specific regions of the country. The regi onal Banks and Bank Branches, like the one here \nin Denver, are under the direction of local boards. Our directors pl ay a key role in connecting the \nFederal Reserve and its policy deliberations direc tly to the communities we serve. We have two \nDenver-area directors on the Ka nsas City office’s board, and the seven-member Denver board \nincludes four Denver-area director s. I would like to recognize how  important these Coloradans \nare to the success of our work and thank each of them for their service to our nation’s central \nbank. \n \nCHALLENGES \nIn the past when I have spoken at this program, my comments have focused almost \nentirely on the economic outlook. In that regard, I can tell you that I see nothing that conflicts \nwith the widely held opinion that we are in recovery. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and \nwe are starting to see improvement in busine ss and manufacturing. Addi tionally, yield spreads \nbetween low-risk assets, such as Treasuries, and higher risk assets are na rrowing. They are not at \nprerecession levels, but there is a clear indicat ion that investors are more willing to provide \ncapital, which is extremely important. A vast amount  of stimulus has been put in place to spark \nthis recovery, and I believe it wi ll prevent a double-dip recession.  \nThe stimulus will, however, present its own challenges. The Federal Reserve and other \ncentral banks around the world will have to unw ind the extensive policy accommodation used to \nhalt the economy’s decline. That will be a de licate process because removing too soon could \nreturn the economy to recession while waiting too long will foster an inflationary spiral. The \nprocess will be particularly deli cate for this recovery because it will proceed slowly, hampered \nby a significant debt overhang and uncertainty  around the condition of some of the largest \nfinancial institutions. Thus, the challenge to mone tary policy is to act in such a manner that you \nencourage the recovery while not fo stering conditions for a future cr isis, albeit one of a different \nnature.  \n\n3 \n As policy is discussed and even debated, it is important to note that the current fed funds \nrate is zero. We all know that the neutral rate is not zero. Equally obvi ous to me is that a rate of 1 \nor 2 percent is not tight monetary policy – it is  still very accommodative.  As we consider our \nchoices, I would not support a tight monetary policy in the current environment, but my \nexperience tells me that we will need to remove our very accommodative policy sooner rather than later. Even if we were to start immedi ately, much time would pass before incremental \nincreases could be considered tight or even neutral policy. \nMonetary policy, however, is not the only area where we will have to consider the long-\nterm implications of our actions as we emerge from  this crisis. In that regard, I think the best use \nof my time here this evening will be to explai n why I think the hard decisions are ahead in the \narea of regulatory reform, which is currently unde r consideration in Congress. Looking at some \nof the policy issues that have emerged in recent  weeks, it seems the public debate continues to \ndistract from what I judge was the primary cause of  this crisis. We must address the issue of too \nbig to fail or we will repeat the mistakes of the past, with ever-worsening consequences. I know \nwe can do better. \n \nREGULATORY REFORM \nToo Big to Fail \nReform in the regulation and oversight of our financial system clearly is needed. As sure \nas we know that tomorrow will arrive, we know that  a financial crisis will occur again at some \ntime in the future. Therefore, the most important  exercise that we s hould undertake now is to \nensure that problems at large financial institu tions are not allowed to  jeopardize the basic \nsurvival of our financial system and economy.  \nHow do we do that?  How do we prevent ince ntive compensation schemes that carry high \ncosts to taxpayers? How do we best protect the consumer from unfair and deceptive practices by \nfirms that are currently unregulated or under-re gulated? While the Administration has taken an \nimportant initial step to address these lapses in our financial system, it is focusing first on \nsymptoms rather than the disease.  \nAdam Smith is often thought of as the E nglish-speaking world’s father of modern \neconomics. He is widely known for hi s book titled, The Wealth of Nations\n, in which he provided \n\n4 \n his analogy that a market economy was like an invi sible hand guiding resources  to their best use. \nLess well-known is another passage in  that book in which he warns that: \n \n“The interest of the dealers … is always in some resp ects different from, and even opposite to, that of the \npublic. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is  always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market \nmay frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be \nagainst it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by ra ising their profits above what they naturally would be, to \nlevy … an absurd tax upon … their fellow-citizens. The pr oposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which \ncomes from this order ought always to be listened to w ith great precaution…. It comes from an order of men whose \ninterest is never exactly the same with  that of the public, who have generally  an interest to deceive and even to \noppress the public, and who … upon many o ccasions, both deceived and oppressed it.” \n \nTo get a sense of what Adam Smith is talk ing about, I would point out that in 1999 the \nCongress passed a piece of legisl ation, heavily endorsed by our la rgest banking firms, called the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This le gislation ended the separation of  commercial and investment \nbanking. It broadened the market and allowed for th e accelerated growth of  large financial firms \nin the United States, turning them into institutio ns that were thought to be “too big to fail.”   \nThis should not be dismissed as a populist vi ew of these institutions, but one that is \nsupported by the data. It is best seen by examin ing the advantages that accrued to these firms \nwith respect to their capital levels. The market, knowing these firms were too big to fail, \ntolerated an ever-expanding levera ge ratio, relative to owner equit y. For example, if you look at \nthe 20 largest instituti ons, their equity-to-assets ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was \nabout 4.3 percent. If you look at th e next smaller group of institutions , their equity-to-assets ratio \nwas almost 6.5 percent. The smaller institutions simply must carry lower leverage ratio because \nall those in the market – management, shareholders  and creditors – know they  will lose their jobs \nand investments if they make d ecisions that cause their banks to  fail. This type of market \ndiscipline is less immediate to the owners  and creditors of th e larger firms.  \nIf you were to place these larg est institutions under the same leverage constraints as the \nsmaller firms – at least 6.5 percent equity to asse t – these larger firms would need to raise more \nthan $275 billion in new capital or shrink their assets by more than $4 trillion. This capital \ndifference is an overwhelming advantage to these largest firms and, indeed, has enabled them to \nnarrow the competition to an incredible degree. Si nce the change in law, the largest 20 firms \nhave increased their control of the nation’s banking assets from about 35 percent to an \n\n5 \n astonishing 70 percent. Even more  striking perhaps is the fact th at some of these firms are now \n30 to 40 percent larger than they were when th is crisis began, and as you know, many of these \nfirms were protected during the crisis.  \nWhen the crisis unfolded and these largest fi rms were at risk of failure, Congress passed \nthe $700 billion TARP legislation. It was done to protect the broa d economy, but it also had the \nadditional effect of institutionalizing t oo big to fail in the United States.  \n \nCompensation \nOne of the ironies of this ac tion is that the management of these firms, even those \nneeding TARP funds to survive,  continues to receive enormous  compensation packages. As a \nresult, one of the issues currently distracti ng Congress and the public is executive compensation. \nI certainly understand the anger directed at the well-paid indi viduals atop large firms that \ncontributed to this crisis. However, a comp rehensive plan for resolving these firms and \ndismissing management, rather than protecting them from failure, woul d address compensation \nissues far more effectively because it would leav e these individuals out of  work and wipe out any \nownership stake they hold. That  does much more for accountability than simply capping an \nindividual’s pay. In fact, there is some question if pay caps could even be firmly implemented – \nas you may know some firms have  already begun to work around compensation limits by raising \nbase salaries to million-dollar levels.  \nCompensation restrictions also  call into question the tenants of capitalism in terms of \nbalancing risk and reward. If we ensure that our resolution system makes management bear the \ncosts of the bad decisions and risk s they take, we also need to le t them reap the rewards of the \ngood decisions. At the very least, new kinds of ma rket distortions might be created by injecting a \ndegree of disconnect between compensation and pe rformance – the same kind of disconnect that \nsome might suggest fosters the type of  carelessness we saw in this crisis. \nLet me give you one example. Let’s say one of the largest financial institutions wanted to \npay a trader a $100 million bonus based on performan ce. I’m not a trader, but I know there is no \nway to earn enough money on trading to gene rate a $100 million bonus without taking open \npositions, which in this example is making bets on behalf of a company that has a major role in our nations’ payments system. If the trader wins , the company makes money. If the trader loses, \ntaxpayers fund the bailout because the institution is large and systemically important. The real \n\n6 \n problem with this scenario is that the company is  too big to fail, not that they are willing to pay \nan enormous sum of money as a bonus. If it’s thei r money, or the money of their shareholders or \ncreditors, I am in favor of letting them set compensation levels. If it’s the money of U.S. \ntaxpayers, then it’s an outrage. Mandating an orderly receivership if the institution fails assures that they gamble w ith their own money. \nIt is also important to acknow ledge that policing such an executive compensation policy \nwill be difficult and inconsistent. For those who are angry about individuals profiting obscenely \nfrom a crisis, it will do nothing to prevent that. Many investors did so during this crisis by rightly \ninterpreting that the government wo uld bail out failed inst itutions and that th e stock prices would \nrecover. Heads I win, tails the public loses is a on e-way bet. It’s not capit alism; it is bad policy. \nOnce again, I suggest that ending too-big-to-fail is th e first step in addressing compensation \nissues. \n \nConsumer Protection \nAnother headline issue in the regulatory reform package relates to the proposed \nConsumer Financial Protection Agen cy. Fair treatment of consumers is extremely important. We \ndo a lot of work throughout our District on cons umer education and consumer issues. Our Bank \nalso hosts a nationwide call cente r on behalf of the entire Fe deral Reserve System. Consumers \ncan contact us by phone\n1 – and they will talk to an actual person, not a machine – or online at \nwww.FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov  to discuss problems related to any financial institution, \nregardless of the regulatory agency  involved. These calls are extrem ely illuminating in what they \ntell us about the relationship between consumers a nd financial institutions. First of all, we handle \nabout 40,000 consumer questions a year, which suggests a lot of  concern and often confusion \nabout consumer rights under the law. However, 90 percent of the complaints we receive are \ntargeted on the largest banks and most often rela ted to credit card issues. Very few complaints \nare made against community banks. And, after th ese complaints have been investigated, few \nagainst community banks are actually found to i nvolve violations of th e consumer protection \nrules. This suggests that  clarification or simp lification of consumer protection rules may be \nnecessary for consumers to better understand what their protections  are under the law. \n                                                             \n1 888‐851‐1920 \n\n7 \n I think we also need to recognize that, while effective consumer protection is a critical \nfoundation of our financial system, weaknesses or ga ps in the enforcement of these laws was not \nthe only factor, or even the driving factor , behind the run-up of subprime lending and the \nresulting wave of foreclosures. What we experi enced was a distortion of incentives in financial \nmarkets amid inflated real estate prices, skyroc keting demand for mortgage backed securities and \na resulting deterioration in underw riting standards for many lenders as they rushed to originate \nmore loans. These dynamics caused too many loans to be extended without a reasonable \nprobability of repayment. The consequences were, of course, disastrous when the housing market \ncollapsed. This experience raises important questions about the incentives involved in \nsecuritizing loans, the ab ility of consumers to receive a loan with little or no upfront money, and \nthe role of nonbank firms, among other issues. Ther e are also lessons to be learned about the \nscope and effectiveness of consum er protection laws, as well as the expectations for regulators \nenforcing these laws.   \nThere are more discussions and debates to take place on this topic, and it is the choice of \nCongress to decide.

Under the coordinated approach we \ncurrently utilize, our goal is  to create a good outcome for consumers and depositors through \nensuring a financially sound and well-managed banking operation that complies with specific \nconsumer protection rules.

Hoenig President Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City          Kansas Bankers Association 2009 Annual Meeting August 6, 2009            The views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  This text was prepared from a transcript of Mr. Hoenig’s remarks.  \n\nI want to thank the Kansas Bankers Association for inviting me here today and for giving me the opportunity to speak on what I consider to be increasingly important challenges confronting our economy in the coming months and years.  The challenges are focused around the common theme of debt and leverage as it impacts the banking industry, government, business and consumers.  How we address these challenges will also affect how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy as we emerge from this recession and beyond.   I’ll start by focusing on the banking industry and the challenge of too-big-to-fail.  The matter of a resolution process for failed large banks must be addressed before the financial system can be fully healed and functional.  Then I will speak on the broader issue of debt, federal government, business and consumer, and the challenges it presents for policy.  These topics are important because, as citizens, we have some very difficult choices before us that will impact us and future generations. Throughout my presentation, I will share a number of charts that illustrate the magnitude of debt and leverage in the economy.  The advantages of too-big-to-fail Chart 1 is a picture of leverage in the banking system and illustrates the enormous advantage of being too big to fail. For example, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the 20 largest financial institutions in the United States controlled more than $12 trillion in assets, supported by more than 3.5 percent equity capital. This chart illustrates how little equity supports that massive amount of assets and risk.  The next group of financial institutions, the non-top 20 financial institutions ($500 million to $100 billion in assets) has an equity capital ratio of 6 percent—notably higher than that of the largest banks. \n\nChart 1 \n Assume for a moment that the 20 largest institutions were required either to raise new equity, or to reduce their total assets to meet the 6 percent equity capital ratio.  This would require that they raise more than $300 billion in new capital or, as Chart 2 shows, they would need to shrink in size by $5 trillion, or some combination of the two options. The numbers in Chart 2 make clear how much of an advantage the larger institutions have over smaller banks, and show the excess leverage the largest banks have accumulated.      3.2%3.2%3.6%6.0%02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000Billions of Dollars Total Assets(less Tier 1 Common)Tier 1 Common\nTop 5Top 10Top 20Non-Top 20Tier 1 Common as % of Total Assets\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 2009]Notes: Graph includes only BHCs that filed the Y9-C which excludes approximately $2 trillion in assets.

They have been bailed out, and proposed legislation allows for that practice to continue.  They have an implied guarantee, which affords them an enormous advantage in terms of their use of leverage and their ability to accumulate assets to unprecedented levels.  The large banks have added capital since the end of the first quarter, but they are far short of achieving a 6 percent ratio of equity capital to assets.  Ironically perhaps, some proposals being offered would require large institutions to hold more than this level of capital.

I would be pleased if these largest institutions were held to the same standards as the non-top 20 firms because the community banking system cannot survive if the largest banks continue with their current advantage, and that obviously has significant adverse effects for the financial system as a whole. There were two pieces of legislation that facilitated our migration toward too big to fail.  Chart 3 illustrates the relative growth in position of the largest institutions against the timeline of Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which permitted banks to grow across state lines, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which eliminated the separation of commercial banking and investment banking.  Since 1990, the largest 20 institutions grew from controlling about 35 percent of industry assets to controlling 70 percent of assets today.  This trend will continue unless we take specific steps to end it.  The way we normally address failure in a capitalistic system is to subject any institution, from the largest institution to the smallest, to the same penalties for bad management. To accomplish this, we must pass legislation mandating that institutions that become insolvent, due to liquidity or capital, be taken over in an orderly fashion and placed under a conservatorship or receivership.  In such an instance, both the equity holders and long-term debt holders should share the losses before the taxpayer is required to bail out the institution. Taking over the failed institution in an orderly fashion—not a panicked fashion—would protect the franchise and, more importantly, protect the economy from instability.  As I have described elsewhere, a resolution framework can be designed that is fair and much more efficient for the economy.  As we have handled the largest institutions through this crisis, they are not market-driven institutions, they are public utilities. This has to change or we \n\nwill not retain the dynamic financial system that has made the United States so successful over its history.  Chart 3 \n  Difficult choices While staying with the theme of debt and difficult choices, I am going to turn next to the challenge of the growing debt levels within our economy and the challenges they present for monetary policy makers, starting with federal debt levels.   0.150.250.350.450.550.650.75\n0.150.250.350.450.550.650.75PercentPercent\n5101520Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994*Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999\nNotes:  *Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 allowed for interstate acquisitions Sources: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated ConditionParent Company Only Financial StatementsConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income19861988 19901992 1994199619982000200220042006 2008Industry Concentration in Top Bank Holding Companies[1986 to Present]\n\nIt is the responsibility of us citizens, through our congressional representatives, to decide how much our government spends and how we allocate those expenditures, which nominally increased to $3 trillion in 2008 from less than $500 billion in 1975.  Medicare, income security, Social Security and veteran’s benefits make up more than half of government spending. Federal outlays also include national defense, education, interest payments on the debt and other expenditures. These expenditures are substantial, and they may grow further as we set forth on implementing a stimulus package and tackle some very difficult health-care issues.  Both these initiatives involve legitimate goals, and it is not my place here to debate the merits or the arguments surrounding them. However, as Chart 4 shows, we need to understand that we, through our government, have already made significant long-term commitments and choices in allocating federal resources.

We are spending 8 percent of our total federal budget just to make the interest payments on that debt, and that too will only increase.

Chart 6 shows that consumer and nonfinancial business debt are each now more than 130 percent of our national income.  Consumer leverage has actually worsened as consumer wealth has declined during this recession due to the collapse in housing and the decline in U.S. equity markets.  Chart 6   \n In an environment where debt is large and growing, low interest rates are preferred by nearly everyone: the government, bankers and bank customers. The desire for low interest rates will put incredible pressure on the Federal Reserve and the central banks of the world to keep rates low. Since Paul Volcker broke the inflationary cycle of the late ’70s and early ’80s, Chart 7 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000\n01975197819811984198719901993199619992002200520085,00010,00015,00020,00025,000DebtConsumer DebtNonfinancial BusinessS&L GovernmentBillions of DollarsBillions of Dollars\nNote: The source is Flow of Funds.

Consequently, we are carrying more debt than we have carried in most of our history, and the pressure to keep rates low is only going to increase as the economy begins to recover from this recession.  Chart 7   \n Chart 8 shows that low interest rates have coincided with a growing level of money in the economy, which the Federal Reserve defines as M2.   Chart 9 suggests further that this growth in money over these past several decades has had a staggering effect on the consumer price level.

That’s an astonishing increase in the general price level, and it represents a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the dollar over time.  These are matters that demand our attention as we make choices involving both fiscal and monetary policy.            Chart 8            \n  In considering these charts and the matters of policy, we should be aware of two pieces of legislation that I suggest influenced their contours: the 1946 Employment Act and the 1977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act. The 1946 Employment Act established as a national priority a goal of low unemployment.  Low unemployment is a worthy goal and one that I share, but it cannot be achieved by systematically keeping interest rates low.  In 1977, Congress passed the Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act—also called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act—which 01975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2003 2005 2007 200920011,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000MoneyBillions of Dollars\nSource: Board of Governors. Money is defined as M2, a broad set of financial assets held principally by households. M2 consists of the sum of (1) currency, (2) traveler's checks, (3) demand deposits, (4) other checkable deposits, (5) savings deposits, (6) small-denomination time deposits, and (7) balances in retail money market mutual funds.  \n\ncalled upon the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, to pursue a dual mandate of promoting long-run stable economic growth and stable prices. Chart 9    \n  Though I am convinced we can achieve both mandates, I also am convinced that both are only possible if the first priority of the central bank is to achieve stable prices.  Understandably, however, many prefer that the emphasis be on growth and low unemployment.   Although the Federal Reserve is insulated from politics, it is not isolated from politics, as you can observe by the frequent congressional testimony of Ben Bernanke and past chairmen. The Federal Reserve System is accountable to Congress for achieving the dual mandate, and the data suggest it has given important deference to the growth objective.    05001914 1924 1934 1944 1954 1964 1974 1984 1994 20041000150020002500Consumer Price IndexIndex, Price Level in 1914 = 1001977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act1946 Employment Act\n\nRecession and recovery These issues provide context for the monetary policy choices that lie ahead. Based on the data we are receiving today, it would appear that we are at the bottom of the recession. The data are mixed, which is usually a sign that we are at the bottom. However, these mixed data also make it difficult to determine just how firmly or quickly we will emerge from the recession. Given the large amounts of consumer, business and government debt that will influence events going forward, I suspect we’re going to recover slowly.  The recovery will be assisted by the fiscal stimulus and an accommodative monetary policy, but it most likely will be slowed by the extensive rebalancing of the economy that has yet to occur. In this environment, one of the Federal Reserve’s major challenges will be how to pull back its highly accommodative monetary policy without undermining the recovery and not igniting inflationary expectations.   We learned in the Great Depression and with the Japanese experience that we have to pull back gently.  At the same time, however, we also learned from the great inflation of the ’70s that we have to be resolute in pulling excess stimulus back or risk greater consequences in the future.  We are going to be walking the “knife’s edge” for some time to come.   In considering this challenge it is important also to realize first that more than half of the current fiscal stimulus package has yet to be spent, so we have yet to see its full effects. In addition, monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative and will provide significant stimulus into 2010 and beyond.    Focusing more narrowly on monetary policy, the excess reserves in the banking system now exceed $800 billion; they were less than $8 billion when this recession started. The balance sheets of the Federal Reserve Banks have increased from $900 billion to more than $2 trillion in \n\nless than two years. As we become more confident that we are at the bottom of the recession and are moving into recovery, we must become more resolute in systematically reducing our balance sheet and raising interest rates to levels we might all agree are more in line with the economy’s long-run growth path.  Moving from zero to one percent, for example, is not a tight policy.  I don’t know what the neutral rate is, but I am certain it isn’t zero. If the monetary stimulus does not come out, the price level trend shown earlier in Chart 9 will only worsen. As a reminder of what that might imply, you need only study the early ’80s when high inflation undermined our economic system.  Paul Volcker’s efforts to bring inflation down then were not without cost and required that the country suffer through a recession nearly as bad as the one we hope we are exiting now.   Conclusion If the government, the banks and consumers address the difficult issues of debt and the Federal Reserve begins to remove the significant stimulus in an orderly fashion, then we will come out of this recession without an inflationary hangover. Noninflationary growth will follow, new wealth will be generated, and we will continue to be the strongest, most successful economy in the world. But in the short run, these actions will involve painful choices, and it is the responsibility of citizens like you, and policymakers like me, to consider the impact of today’s choices on tomorrow. We must choose well."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n    \n“Bankruptcy and the Financial Crisis” \nStern School of Business, New York University \nNew York, N.Y. \nJune 30, 2009 \n \n\n2 \n Introduction  \nThank you for inviting me here today for wh at is an especially timely discussion.  \nThose who are familiar with my public remark s know that I do not accept that some firms \nare “too big to fail.”  I do not be lieve it's inevitable or desirable to continue to have too-big-to-\nfail financial institutions because they pose an on going threat to financial stability.  Now is the \ntime to seriously consider a mandatory resoluti on process based on an obj ective set of criteria \nthat puts the largest financial organizations on notice they won’t recei ve a disproportionate \nsubsidy or guarantee.  \nWhen the financial crisis was unfolding, publ ic authorities responded with a number of \nad hoc steps. These actions kept afloat seve ral large financial and nonfinancial firms whose \ncollapse many thought would prove devastating to the financial system and the economy.  The \nnames of the institutions are well known: AIG,  Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and \nMerrill Lynch. There were also initiatives to  support financial sector firms through TARP \nmoney. \nWith few exceptions, the steps taken to s upport these firms were outside the normal \nframework established to deal with troubled entities. The re lated actions raise important \nquestions around too big to fail and whether tr aditional corporate bankruptcy procedures and \nbank receiverships are adequate to the task of re solving failed firms.  The options chosen also \nraise important issues of fairness and the equity  of outcomes.  We know that public assistance \ninvolves political choice, which t oo often undermines market discip line and the proc ess of failure \nand renewal so essential to the long-r un success of our capitalistic system.   \n\n3 \n In my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss the role that I believe bankruptcy and bank \nreceivership authority must play in a financial crisis, the lessons we should learn from our recent \nexperience, and what steps we should put in place to deal with future disruptions.  \n \nThe resolution of depository instit utions and corporate bankruptcies \nManaging insolvency for depository institutions differs markedly from what we do with \nmost other corporations. Although we have ma ny experts here on both bank resolution and \ncorporate bankruptcy, I would like to briefly compare these appro aches before discussing issues \naround the resolution of larg e failing institutions. \nOur approach in dealing with insolvent banks  is largely based on the idea that because \nbanks serve a critical role in the payments a nd credit systems, their failures involve potential \ncostly externalities. Bank failures, of any size, could lead to significant di sruptions in the ability \nof individuals and businesses with in a community to carry out timel y transactions.  Furthermore, \nif the largest institutions are involved, these disruptions could bring about a systemic breakdown \nin financial markets and cause substa ntial harm to the overall economy.   \nThe primary focus in bank resolutions is to protect depositors at the least cost to the \ninsurance fund and, wherever possible, ensure continued access to ba nking services with \nminimal disruption to the overall economy. This requires timely action. As such, bank \nresolutions occur under an admini strative process with the FDIC acting as receiver.  The FDIC \nhas a number of “superpowers” it can use in its role, including the ability to reorganize or \nrestructure a failed bank, sell portions of the bank’s assets and operati ons, and repudiate certain \ntypes of claims and contracts.  \nOverall, the bank resolution process m oves quickly through prescribed steps. \n\n4 \n The failure of nonfinancial corporations i nvolves a more deliberative process. Although \nthe failure of these firms may have a significan t effect on individuals and economic outcomes, \nthey do not pose the same type of liquidity a nd systemic issues as the failure of a bank. \nConsequently, the resoluti on process differs in some important ways from that of banks; most \nnotably the resolutions are handled through the ba nkruptcy courts and are initiated either by a \nfirm’s creditors or its managers. The court pro cess concentrates on maximizing the value of the \nfirm and the creditors’ claims either through the firm’s liquidation or as an ongoing concern.  \nBankruptcy courts, moreover, could be characterized as part of a “time out” process in which \nneutral judges work with creditor s and other parties to resolve conflicts of interest and protect \ncreditors. \nDespite the differences in these two processes,  there are important commonalities as well.  \nIn both cases there is a strict set of procedures established under th e rule of law that sets out, for \nexample, a “priority of claims.”  Also, both fo cus on an orderly process and equitable outcomes \nwith care being taken to minimi ze political factors that might otherwise interfere with the \nresolution process. \n \nLessons to be learned \nAlthough we have a legal framework for dealing with failing institutions, we have \nlearned that, in a crisis, the “systemic spillover”  that can emerge from failures of our largest \ninstitutions and the threat to  the broad economy require additi onal consideration.  The most \nrecent examples of this have led to the susp ension of normal bankruptcy and bank resolution \nprocesses, thus institutionalizing the concept of too big to fail in our economic system. \n\n5 \n Even outside of the banking system, major securities firms and AIG, an insurance \ncompany, were thought to be systemically signi ficant because of their many connections and \nexposures with other firms and markets. Theref ore, it was concluded they could not be put \nthrough bankruptcy.  Many view the bankruptcy of Lehman Brot hers and its aftermath as a \njustification for bailing out other large financial institutions.  \nBut we have also learned, or been reminded, that too big to fail has adverse consequences \nas well.  Every financial crisis leaves a trail of losses embedde d among market participants.  The \nprocess of recovery must start with the recognition of these losses, which then must be distributed among the participants.  Moreover, in some instances the extent of the losses \nultimately requires the recapitalization or closing of the institutions and the replacement of the \nmanagement responsible for the failure.  When excep tions are made to this process for any set of \ninstitutions, especially our largest, this proce ss of recovery is delaye d or compromised.  In \naddition, taxpayers most often must bear the bur den of recapitalizing too-big-to-fail institutions, \nplacing billions of dollars of their funds at ris k.  And too often, the management who created the \nproblems or who failed to demonstrate the leader ship necessary to properly run the institution \nremains in place.   \nSuch interventions tend to break down market discipline and involve public authorities, \nnot the market, choosing winners and losers.  In  FDIC receivership or bankruptcy, institutions \nand claimants must deal with usi ng tested procedures and a set of rules that help ensure that all \nparties, regardless of size, are tr eated comparably. With too big to fail, this process is suspended \nand firms are treated differentl y based on one criterion: size. \n\n6 \n Thus, while in the middle of a crisis, short cu ts to tested resolution processes may appear \nand even be necessary, they almost certainly l eave us with a less efficient and less competitive \nmarketplace.    \n \nWhat steps should we take?  \nAs policymakers consider the administra tion’s recent proposal for a new resolution \nauthority for systemically important financial in stitutions, it is crucial that we ask ourselves \nseveral important questions.  For example, given wh at we have learned from this crisis, how can \nwe address the issue of systemic vulnerability th at is inherent in any system with institutions \nallowed to be too big to fail?  How can we better assure that managers, stockholders and \ncreditors know that there will be a credible sy stem that puts them at risk?  And how can we \nresolve large institu tions without raising systemic concerns  or disrupting key financial activities \nor markets?  I suggest there ar e three fundamental steps to addr essing the matter of too big to \nfail.   \nFirst, there needs to be a se t of basic rules of performan ce that apply to systemically \nimportant institutions.  I would emphasize that these rules need to be easily understood and \nenforceable.  For example, I strongly support si mple leverage standards for setting capital \nrequirements at financial instit utions.  Leverage re strictions, once assigned, are simple to \nunderstand and calculate.  They are straightforward to enforce and, if enforced appropriately, are \ncountercyclical.  Risk-based capit al standards, in cont rast, are complex, procyclical, and easier to \navoid.  Many institutions, in fact, have signifi cantly underestimated their risk exposure over the \nlast few years. These errors could have left them  with even greater capital shortages if they had \nbeen free to follow a true risk-based capital appr oach. While no system is perfect, clear and firm \n\n7 \n rules are easier to understand and enforce.  Pr inciples-based oversigh t is an exercise in \nphilosophy, not a supervisory framework.  \nSecond, there must be a clearly defined reso lution regime for systemically important \nfirms that are in financial trouble.  When addr essing serious problems, such a regime should set \nforth fundamental steps that ensure a continu ity of key operations but  which also carefully \nconfine policymakers from making special  exceptions to a defined process. \nSome have well illustrated the responses a ssociated with the recent crises to an \nemergency crew acting to save a burning home before it destroys th e entire neighborhood. I \nagree  that acting to save the neighborhood was important. However, to extend the metaphor, if \nthe fire was started by a homeowner who ignor ed fire codes and smoked in bed, should the \nneighbors be required to rebuild the home at twice its original si ze at their expense? \nWhile we could have addressed the too big to fail issue with current tools, a statutorily \nsanctioned resolution process would significantly im prove our ability to deal with failed large \nbank holding companies and large nonbank financ ial institutions. The Tr easury Department’s \nplan for Financial Regulatory Reform and its  resolution regime for failing bank and other \nfinancial holding companies provide a starting po int for discussing the is sue of too big to fail \ninstitutions, but it is only a start. \nIn the proposal there are a num ber of issues that deserve careful consideration. They \ninclude, for example, how solvency recomm endations would be determined among the \nconsolidated and financial subsid iary regulators. Also, the proce ss will need to be much more \nspecific in how we determine which institutions a nd activities would be regarded as systemic and \ncome under the federal safety net or public protection. For example, I would limit such \nboundaries to those institutions that  are directly and indirectly part of our economy’s plumbing: \n\n8 \n our system for payments and for the provision of liquidity.  Inside these boundaries would be all \nbanks and bank holding companies and any institu tion that has direct access to the payments \nsystem and to the Federal Reserve discount wind ow.  On the other hand, hedge funds would be \noutside the boundaries of the safety net, although they could be required to register and report \nunder SEC rules.  The plan must also more preci sely define how the cost of resolving a large \ninstitution would best be  distributed.  Such cost s are substantial and should be allocated to those \ninstitutions that benefit the most  from the public safety net.  \nThe most important part of any plan, how ever, will be the requirement that public \nauthorities resolve such institut ions by taking them into receivership and restructuring them to \nemerge under new and more careful management  and ownership. This step should be taken \nwhenever the chartering and supervisory authoritie s judge an institution to be insolvent from a \nliquidity or balance sheet pers pective, and I would advocate no  exceptions.  If a resolution \nprocess exists, then few, if any, exceptions will be necessary. \nUnder the pressure of a crisis, as we have  seen, it is difficult to avoid a piecemeal \napproach to dealing with systemically importa nt institutions with all of the unintended \nconsequences that seem to follow.  Thus, our en ergies in refining the pr oposed legislation should \nfocus on how best to narrow the exceptions a nd assure that a receiv ership or bankruptcy \nframework operates according to the rule of law and insulated from political interference. In \nbanking, Congress has set the receiv ership rules with independent  regulators making solvency \ndecisions and carrying out the reso lution process. A similar format must be part of the resolution \nprocess for systemically important, large financial organizations.   \n\n9 \n Third, in resolving issues around any failed firm, especially too big to fail firms, \nmanagement and stockholders must be accountable  for their actions. Restructured firms must \nhave new – and more careful – management and ownership. \nToo often institutions drift w ithout a clear vision of the or ganization’s goals with no one \nmaking the hard decisions. Other shortcomings include a failure or unwillingness to understand \nthe financial instruments the institution holds, re lying on mechanics rather than sound judgment.  \nToo often management has a greater concern fo r expanding the balance sheet than for managing \nexisting activities. Within today’s largest orga nizations, we have lear ned of individuals who \nwillingly carried a hefty title for the purpose of representation of the organization but with no \nunderstanding – and no requirement or desire to  understand – the busine ss lines, operations or \ncondition of the organization.  From the volume of  complaints blaming rating agencies for the \ncurrent crisis, it seems that far too few senior execu tives in these largest organizations believed it \nwas their responsibility to understand the fi nancial products their company was buying and \ntrading in quantities of billions and trillions of dollars.  This  is not only unaccept able, but also a \ndereliction of duty.   \nDealing with leadership issues is challe nging and should be addressed by respective \nboards and stockholders. But if a board fails to do so, then the compa ny’s likelihood of failure \nincreases.  When failure occurs, certainly new management must be required as part of any \nresolution process. One might observe that a CE O and his board of directors are hardly in a \nposition to be angry with any government-impos ed restrictions on compensation when they \nneglected their responsibility to manage a sound company.  \nA final point that needs to be highlighted is that there must be confidence in the fairness \nof any resolution process if it is to be successful over time . Capitalism works only if all \n\n10 \n competitors are held to the same standard and have equal opportunities to succeed or fail.  With \ntoo big to fail, capitalism is compromised and equ ity of opportunity is sacr ificed to expediency. \nThe vast majority of banks in the United States have complied with regulations and \nrequirements that, though necessary, are costly. Th ese banks have played by the rules or suffered \nthe consequences of not doing so during market turmoil. Understandably, today these smaller \ninstitutions are concerned about  the prospect of increased re gulatory requirements and an \nincreased competitive advantage that flows to the largest firms.  Such an outcome would \nundermine confidence in the market system th at has brought this c ountry past success. \n \nConclusion \nThe current crisis has made it clear that the group of systemically important firms that \nmight be deemed worthy of special consideratio n by policymakers is larger than previously \nthought. This extension of the too big to fail co ncept, along with the wide variety of public \nassistance and guarantees we’ve seen used in rece nt months, make it even more important that \npolicymakers find ways to deal with large failing institutions.  \nFailing to have a process that operates according to the rule of law and is free of political \ninfluence means an even larger section of our financial markets will operate on the assumption \nthat the idea of failure – a key element in mark et discipline – does not apply in all instances. \nOnce this happens, it will be difficult for other institutions to survive and compete, and for our \nmarkets to be competitive and efficient.  Importantl y, it will not be realistic for any authority in \nany regulatory structure to oversee a system where incentives remain to take on excessive risk."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n         \n \n     \nSheridan, Wyo. \nJune 3, 2009 \n  \n    \nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, \nofficers or representatives. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nThank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak with you here in Sheridan today. It is \na pleasure to be here, and it has been a genuine opportunity for the directors and staff of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to learn firs t hand what is happening in this part of our \nregion.   \nIn thinking about the long run while cont emplating the current economic situation, I \nwould humbly amend the famous observation of economist John Maynard Keynes. In the long \nrun, we are all dead but our childr en will be left to pick up the ta b.  With that in mind, today I \nwill focus on some of the longer-run challenges we  face as we emerge from the current financial \nand economic crisis. These challenges can most certa inly be dealt with, but they require that we \nbegin now to address them genuinely and systemati cally or we risk repea ting past mistakes and \ncreating an environment that lead s to our next set of crises. \n \nNear-term outlook \nI’ll begin my remarks by stating that my view of the more immediate outlook for the U.S. \neconomy is that we will emerge from this recessi on – perhaps as soon as the second half of this \nyear, but most likely in early 2010, as many econom ists project. If for no other reason, the \neconomy should respond positively to the significant degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus that \nhas been directed into the economy over the past several months.  Let me briefly describe those \nactions. \nMonetary policy is enormously accommodative, w ith the fed funds rate being near zero.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s lending programs and support of the housing market provides significant \nadditional liquidity and stimulus  to our financial markets and economy.  The Federal Reserve is \nin the process of purchasing longer-term assets  including Treasury secu rities, which adds  \n \n\n3 \n \nsignificant stimulus.  In total, these actions will increase the Federal Reserve Banks’ combined \nbalance sheets to more than $3 trillion from less than $1 trillion less than two years ago.  \nFiscal policy also has been highly expansionary  and will provide trillions in stimulus over \nthe coming quarters and years.  For example, th e Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) placed \n$700 billion into the financial indus try and parts of the auto industr y just within the past eight \nmonths. The fiscal stimulus package recently im plemented into law provides nearly $800 billion \nin tax cuts, grants to state governments, expanded jobless benefits and sign ificant infrastructure \nspending on highways and other tr ansportation enhancements, a nd on clean energy initiatives \nthat are unprecedented in size and scope. Frankly, it would be surprising if the economy failed to \nrecover based on the magnitude of thes e monetary and fiscal programs.  \nDespite these actions, I expect  the recovery to be more modest than some economists \nproject. The U.S. economy is working through a seri es of difficult structural adjustments, as are \nmany of our trading partners. Our financial institutions remain fragile and will require significant \nadditional amounts of capital to regain their stabili ty. How we choose to do this will affect the \npublic’s confidence in these inst itutions and their ability to support the recovery. The housing \nmarket continues to struggle as it downsizes fr om past financial and sp eculative excesses and the \nassociated misallocation of resources. Consumers are adjusting to a significant loss in wealth \nassociated with the declining housing and stock markets, and job losses.  Recovery in these \ncircumstances will take time and require patience if  we are to avoid mistakes in our efforts to \nbring the economy forward.   \nThus, while I am convinced that the economic recovery we all want will develop, it will \nbe slower and more fragile than we hope for. \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nFixes for the long run \n This recession is often described as the wo rst in post-World War II history, and that may \nvery well be correct.  From it will flow a host of po licy issues that will require careful review and  \nhard choices if we are to assure  our national economy’s long-term strength and vitality.  In this \nregard, I would like to direct th e remainder of my remarks to th ree policy issues: the need to \naddress fundamental weaknesses w ithin our financial system; the need to address significant \nimbalances within the U.S. economy; and the need to act to avoid an infl ationary outbreak that \ncould come with current fi scal and monetary policy.  \n \nThe financial system  \n  Over the past year, we have  seen the U.S. financial system  nearly collapse.  Financial \ninstitution failures have include d Bear Stearns, Fannie and Fre ddie, and Lehman Brothers.  \nMeanwhile, billions of dollars  in taxpayer money have b een needed by CitiGroup, Bank of \nAmerica and AIG.  The panic that followed these events affected the broader economy, \nworsening the current recession.  It is apparent that we need a bette r set of incentiv es within the \nindustry and better oversight by the regulatory authorities if we ar e to avoid a repeat of these \nevents in the future.  Moreover, if we hesitate to make needed changes, we will perpetuate an \noligarchy of interests that will fail to serve the best interest of business, the consumer and the \nU.S. economy.  \n In our efforts to fix the oversight pro cess for our financial system, we should not \nmisdiagnose the patient. Unfortunately, I’m afraid we are witnessing some regulatory \nmalpractice now. The emphasis on reform at this moment is to change the structure of the \nregulatory system rather than address the fundament al weakness of that system.  Leading to this \ncrisis were a series of steps that eliminated or compromised financial standa rds that had served to  \n\n5 \n \nsupport sound financial practices fo r generations.  For the most part, these rules were simple in \nform, understandable and enforceable.  They se rved to constrain excessive leverage and \nundisciplined growth using simple leverage ratios, and they focused on fundamental  \nunderwriting standards such as limits on loan-to-va lue.   Accordingly, I am convinced that before \nwe spend time and energy restructuring the regul atory system, we should first determine which \nrules of conduct should be reintr oduced and enforced to provide for better outcomes. Perhaps in \nthe end there will be consensus to change our oversight structure, but I suspect reestablishing and then enforcing rules that have proven effectiv e over time will do more than the make-work \nexercise of regulatory restructur ing.  After all, England has one regulator and has fared no better \nin the current financial crisis.   \nIn discussing any aspect of financial refo rm, one of the most significant changes that \nmust be accomplished is the end of “Too Big To Fail.”  If nothing else, this current financial \ncrisis has confirmed its existence.  Capitalism is  a process of success, failure and renewal, and \nfor it to work properly, institutions must be a llowed to fail, no matter their size or political \ninfluence.  Institutions that are considered too big to fail have an implied subsidy.  Research suggests that these firms are thought to have a lower cost of funds and a competitive advantage \nover their less “systemically important” competit ors.   Too big to fail introduces a “moral \nhazard” problem for society where creditors of these firms lessen their due-diligence programs \nknowing that they will be bailed out by the government  should the institutions fail.  The effect is \nto lower the costs to these firm s and significantly raise costs to the taxpayer and, ultimately, to \nfundamentally weaken our financial system.   \nFinally, ending too big to fa il is not the same as endorsing a disorderly liquidation \nprocess for institutions.  Rather it demands a mark et-oriented solution to poor performance.  It \nrequires a resolution process that holds management  and investors accounta ble for their actions  \n\n6 \n \nand, properly structured, it provides for an orderl y transition to new owners hip or the closing of \nthe institution with the least disruption to the market and economy.  I have previously outlined \nvarious examples of how this might be done base d on what has worked in our financial history \nand in other countries.  It is imperative that we learn from these examples.  If we do not address \nthis issue, we will certainly i nvite a repeat of the recent fina ncial turmoil and its devastating \neffect on our economy. \n \nImbalances and economic stability   \nOver the past two decades, the U.S. has created for itself a set of economic imbalances \nthat, in my judgment, have significantly increa sed uncertainty and placed economic growth at \nrisk for future generations of Americans.  That is  a serious statement to make, so let me set out a \nfew facts to illustrate my point.  As a nation, th e U.S. has been living beyond its means for many \nyears.  The U.S. current account balance since 1990 has declined steadily from approximately in \nbalance to a deficit of 6.5 per cent of our GDP in 2005, and it remain s at nearly 4 percent of GDP \ntoday.  At its peak, this equates to almost $900 billion that the U.S. has borrowed from the rest of \nthe world on an annual basis.  If this were be ing used to finance produc tive investment, I would \nnot be overly concerned because the returns we  earn could finance the cost of borrowing.  \nUnfortunately, however, a large share of  U.S. imports is for consumption. \nThe reality of this imbalance is brought furt her into focus when we realize that U.S. \nconsumption as a percent of GDP has increased from an already relativ ely high 66 percent in  \n1990 to 70 percent in 2006 and remains near this leve l even today.  Just as significant is the fact \nthat U.S. aggregate personal savings had fallen from  an already low rate of 5 percent of GDP in \n1990 to near zero in 2006.  More significant still is the fact that for the same period, consumer \ndebt to income increased from a high of 84 percent to nearly 135 percent.  \n\n7 \n \nFinally, our federal government has, except for a short period at the end of the ’90s, run \nits own chronic annual deficit, whic h is projected to approach $2 tril lion this fiscal year and will \nremain large for years to come. Moreover, thes e projections do not include the effects of \nadditional trillions of dollars of  unfunded promises we have made to ourselves to provide Social \nSecurity and Medicare bene fits for decades to come. \nBecause the U.S. economy is so large and, by hi storical standards, so successful, it has \nthe capacity to carry such imbalances far longe r than most economies would be permitted in \ntoday’s global markets. However, such an adva ntage will eventually end and comes with its own \ncosts.  Over time, an ever-increasing amount of national and personal debt will raise the cost of \ncapital. As these costs increase, investment will slow and cause lower productivity, yet an \nimproving level of productivity is what is required to maintain a high standard of living.   The \ndecrease in economic growth will most likely come slowly and be modest, but its compounding \neffects over future generations will be significant.  For exampl e, over a 25-year period, a 25-\nbasis-point reduction in real GDP  growth would imply a difference of nearly 6 percent in the \nlevel of GDP, all else equal, as we economists like to say.  In other words, seemingly small \npercentages can have an enormous  impact on future generations. \n \nThe inflation challenge  \n            It is one thing to outline the challe nges we face, it is quite another to address them.  To \nillustrate this point, I would direct you to an article by Martin Barnes, the managing editor of  \nThe Bank Credit Analyst , published this May.  In estimating th e effect on consumption growth if \nthe annual savings rate steadily increased from zero toward 8 percent between now and the end \nof 2013, the article suggests that consumer spendi ng would grow at an average rate of only 1.3 \npercent per year.  This would be  a significant reduction of consump tion growth, the slowest since  \n\n8 \n \nthe 1930s.  There can be little doubt that such a growth rate would have a significant adjustment \neffect, even if only temporary, not only on the U. S., but also on the rest of the world. For the \nU.S., it most likely would imply the need to shif t resources toward the export sector, and for our \ntrading partners, it would mean re lying less on sales to the U.S.  \nStarting from where we are today, it is clear th at interest rates must  rise. As the economy \nrecovers, even at a modest pace, resource demands will begin to increase. At this point, the current level of monetary accommodation will need to be withdrawn to avoid introducing \ninflationary impulses. Also, with the almost certain adjustments that need to occur in \nconsumption, savings and the rebalancing of im ports and exports, I expect there would be \nadditional pressure for interest rates to rise  steadily over time. To the extent that these \nadjustments will require considerable time to co mplete, unemployment levels, for example, may \ndecline more slowly than anyone wants.  \nIf such a set of events occurs , then I also suspect there will be considerable pressure on \nthe central bank to “help out” in easing this adju stment process by keeping interest rates low for \nan extended period.  This happens because people often confuse the establis hment of low interest \nrates – and therefore the creation of money – with the creation of  wealth.  Sadly, through history, \nit has been shown repeatedly th at excessive reliance on monetary  policy as a means to avoid  \nfundamental economic policy choices leads to hi gh inflation and an actual worsening of an \neconomy’s long-term performance. I hope the U.S. can avoid the temptation to take policy short cuts as we emerge from this recession.  We f ace difficult adjustments that must yet be made. The \nprocess will not be free of pain.  \n\n9 \n \nThe Federal Reserve System over the past ne arly two years has more than doubled its \nbalance sheet as it has provided liquidity and m onetary stimulus to the U.S. and world economy.  \nIn doing so, it has served to staunch the financia l and economic panic.  But it now must turn to \nthe matter of carefully removing this  stimulus at the very time that consumers, businesses and the \ngovernment will need to fund pent-up demand fo r goods and services and to meet committed \nobligations.  There is little doubt  that such a “coincidence” of needs will place upward pressure \non interest rates.  Central banks will have little choi ce but to allow these increases to occur or \nrisk the consequence of higher in flation, perhaps significantly higher.  As I said, this process of \nremoving past monetary accommodation will be resisted.  However, in contemplating this process and the pain of adjustment, I often em phasize that inflation is the least fair, most \nregressive and most corrosive tax we can impose on ourselves. It is particularly harsh for low- to \nmoderate-income citizens. \nFinally, the markets won’t be fooled by ar tificially low rates for long.  Market \nparticipants realize that a pe riod of high deficits and accomm odative monetary policy are an \ninvitation to increased inflationary  pressure. I suspect we are expe riencing the first signs of the \nmarkets’ concerns in the rising rates and increased volatility in longer-term Treasury markets. I \nsuggest strongly that we need to be alert to th e markets’ message and be gin in earnest to bring \nmonetary policy into bett er balance before inflation forces our hand. \n \nConclusion \nAs we emerge from this global financial crisis and recession, the United States must \naddress a series of significant financial and econo mic imbalances and risks.  In dealing with \nthese challenges, the Federal Reserve must stay  focused on our mission and make the tough – if  \n\n10 \n \nunpopular – decisions that will he lp guide our economy into be tter condition.  A central bank’s \nmission remains that of holding the trust of the public by providing a stable currency that retains \nits purchasing power over time.  It  is for governments and businesse s to allocate resources that \naddress our economic challenges.  These are not  things that a central bank should address \ndirectly.   No matter how well-intentioned, to a ttempt to do so goes beyond its mission and risks \ndelaying and worsening the inevitable adjustment."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n         \n \n \n \n     \nECB/De Nederlandsche Bank Conference,  \nFrankfurt,  \nMay 25, 2009 \n \n \n\n2 \n \nThank you for the opportunity to be here today a nd participate in this conference on retail \nbanking and the role of central banks.  It is a pleasure for me to join you and provide my \nperspective on the U.S. retail payments system.   \nDiscussion regarding this topi c could not be more timely. Retail payments in the United \nStates and worldwide have undergone an enorm ous transformation over th e past decade driven \nby technology and, just as importantly, notable cha nges in consumer preference.  We get a sense \nof this change from a recent Federal Reserve study indicating that electronic payments now \nexceed two-thirds of all noncash payments in the United States. The efficiency, convenience, \nspeed and ease of use have fueled this transforma tion and will continue to do so for some time to \ncome. \nConsistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to ensure the integrity and efficiency of \nthe payments system, we were a strong advocate of the migration of pa yments to electronic \nmechanisms.  Though the electronic nature of retail payments has affected the Federal Reserve’s \ntraditional role, the Federal Reserve’s mandate has not changed.  Although some question \nwhether the Federal Reserve can or should play an important role in retail payments over the \nlong term, a strong case can be made for expa nding the Federal Reserve’s role in electronic \npayments if it is to fulfill its mandate.  \nToday I will discuss my own view that the Federal Reserve should not be contemplating \nan exit from retail payments. Coupled with the ri se in electronic payments products, a dramatic \nchange in the structure of the payments indus try has introduced new challenges to assuring the \ncompetitiveness and safety of this system.  The industry’s structure has been heavily influenced by economies of scale, which has brought with it an increased level of conc entration in debit and \ncredit markets.  For example, in 2007, the three largest PIN debit networks handled more than 81 \n\n3 \n \npercent of all transaction volume. Comparatively,  in 1995, the three larges t networks controlled \nonly 46 percent of the market. More  striking, perhaps, is the fact  that over the same period, the \nnumber of networks dropped from 43 to 14.  Si milar trends are evident in signature debit and \ncredit card issuance.  And, of course, in the Un ited States, three networ ks have long dominated \ncredit card clearing.  To me, these devel opments raise important concerns about the \ncompetitiveness of card payments systems. \nThere are also reasons to be concerned about th e integrity of this system.  Growing levels \nof concentration and an increasi ng complexity of systems have i nvited greater vulnerability to \ndisruption and an enhanced poten tial for “single points of failur e.”  The increasing complexity \nhas raised the opportunity for fraud. There also  has been a growth in the prominence of \nnonbanks, introducing new ri sks to the system. \nIn light of these developments, I believe th at the Federal Reserve needs to continue \nplaying a strong role in retail payments.  Before  looking more closely at what role the Federal \nReserve could play in the future, it may be usef ul to consider the economic rationale for central \nbank involvement in retail payments more ge nerally.  This rationale revolves around the \nexistence of externalities that potentially underm ine the efficiency and integrity of payments \nsystems. \nPayments products and services require a cri tical mass of participan ts on two sides of a \nmarket.  For example, a significant number of merchants must be willing to accept a specific \nform of payment before consumers will use it. Conversely, a substantial number of consumers \nmust use that form of payment before merchants will consider installing any necessary equipment or software.  In this situation, a ne w product or network might not develop because, at \nthe individual level where such choices are ma de, neither consumers nor  businesses have an \n\n4 \n \nincentive to use the product. Both sides, however , might benefit if such a product was in place. \nSuch externalities, in which individual benefits  or costs do not coincide  with those accruing to \nsociety, can justify a public sector role in providing the service. \nSimilarly, there are possible externalities re lated to coordination. Situations arise in \npayments markets where coordination among particip ants benefits both participants and users — \nfor example, adoption of uniform standards or a common technology.  But agreements around \ncommon standards or technology are difficult to achieve because par ticipants vary in size and \npreferences.  In addition there can be a “free-rider” problem, wh ere those that stay outside the \nprocess avoid cost associated with any agreem ent that might be made. The result is an \nunderprovision of services or products. One es pecially important ex ample is the potential \n“underinvestment” in payments security by the pr ivate sector, for example, the continued use of \nmagnetic strip authentication for credit cards rather than more secure smart card authentication. \nThese externalities help explain the Federal Re serve’s traditional role in retail payments, \nespecially its role as operator in check pro cessing and ACH. Its early check processing \ninvolvement was largely a response to the fragment ed nature of the industry as payments carried \nacross literally thousands of co mmercial banks dispersed across  a wide geographic area.  Non-\npar clearing was the norm, and remote locations  were inadequately served.  Under such \ncircumstances, it took only a few years for the Fe deral Reserve System to be involved in roughly \n50 percent of the value cleared through clearinghouses.  By entering the market and ultimately becoming a prominent participant, the Fed was, in  effect, addressing coor dination difficulties and \nnetwork effects.  Similarly, it was instrumental  in the 1950s and 1960s in working with industry \nparticipants to establish the MICR standard a nd to develop high-speed sorting equipment. \n\n5 \n \nWith regard to ACH, in the 1970s, the Fede ral Reserve assumed a leadership role in \npromoting this technology to provide an alte rnative for bank-to-bank small dollar payments. \nPrivate sector banks, facing high startup cost s and low ACH volumes, were understandably \nreluctant to invest in a new network. Without bank participation, there would not be consumer \ninvolvement. The Fed’s participation helped addr ess this externality. It became one of the key \nACH operators, and for a few years following imple mentation of the Monetary Control Act, it \nsubsidized the ACH network. Over time, a criti cal mass was achieved, and today the ACH is one \nof the nation’s most heavily used retail payments systems. \nIn light of the trend toward greater industry concentration a nd the existence of important \npayments system externalities, the Federal Reserv e should play a larger an d more active role in \nelectronic retail payments if it wants to promote the efficiency and integrity of the payments \nsystem.  The key question is how this role shou ld be defined.  While the Federal Reserve could \nfocus more on regulation and overs ight to achieve its mandate as many other central banks are \ndoing, I suggest that it should leverage its experi ence and position as an operator to achieve its \nobjectives. \nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s role in both checks and ACH reflects a preference to \noperate within the market rather than as a pure regulator. We ar e well aware that industries can – \nand do – quickly develop methods to exploit any regulatory loopholes and avoid the intended \noutcome.  By competing with the private sector on a level playing field, the Federal Reserve can \nencourage efficiency and integrity  from an “on the ground” position.  \nLooking forward, I also suggest that it could do so in the r ealm of electronic payments \nmore broadly.  The Federal Reserve’s operati onal role will likely revolve around its ACH  \n\n6 \n \nplatform. Currently, the Federal Re serve is filling an important role in an ACH industry where \nthe Electronics Payments Network (EPN) is the only other active op erator, and where the \nelimination of either party leaves a highly c oncentrated and less competitive market. While a \nrecent joint processing venture announced by Bank of America and Wells Fargo may spur the entry of a third ACH operator, economies of scale make entry difficult, especially in these times \nwhere capital is scarce and expensive. Without the Fed, it seems unlikely that a more competitive environment would emerge. \nACH volume has been steadily increasing in r ecent years with significant growth in \nnontraditional payments, such as Internet trans actions and the conversion of paper checks to \nelectronic debits. Moreover, the volume and nature of ACH tran sactions have evolved to the \npoint where the ACH network is clearly of syst emwide importance so that a major disruption \ncould have significant effects on the paymen ts system and the broader economy.     \nThus, in my view, the Federal Reserve’s futu re role in retail pa yments should be built \naround its current position in ACH.  For example, in its operator role, the Federal Reserve could \naugment its ACH products and services, with the ai m of enhancing competition and safety within \nthe ACH industry.  An example where this is occurring is with same-day ACH settlement, which the Federal Reserve recently announced it will be gin to offer in the second quarter of 2010. This \nwill provide originating and receiving banks the option to accelerate the clearing and settlement \nof certain ACH debit payments, which will provide  an earlier opportunity to  identify return items \nand reduce risk.   \n\n7 \n \nThe Federal Reserve could also work with EPN to provide reciprocal backup services \nwith each other as well as with other electr onic payments networks, and thereby serve as a \n“switch of last resort.”  Such a role would prove invaluable in the event of  serious disruptions to \nmajor networks, however unlikel y such disruptions might be. \nFinally, the Federal Reserve could enhance competition in payment card markets by \npositioning ACH services as an alte rnative to debit card payment networks.  I am not suggesting \nthe Federal Reserve would issue its own cards or  operate its own card ne twork.  However, the \nFederal Reserve could add enhancements to its ACH network, enabling it to become an \nalternative to running transacti ons over card networks.  The recent development of so-called \ndecoupled debit cards provides an example of the industry making use of the ACH network in \nthis way. \nIn summary, as the payments system continue s to evolve, the Federal Reserve’s role will \nneed to change.  In my view, it would not be de sirable for the Federal Reserve to scale back its \npresence in retail payments or even exit retail payments as some might advocate.  Rather, the \nexistence of important external ities and increasing industry c oncentration suggest that the \nFederal Reserve must stay involved in retail pa yments.  The question, then, is what form this \ninvolvement should take.  Many centr al banks in a similar situati on will likely opt to rely on a \nregulatory and oversight role.  However, in part because of its unique history as an operator, I \nbelieve the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to le verage its traditional operator role to better \nenhance the integrity and effici ency of the payments system."

And, as matters deteriorated, \nthere was a further escalation of policy intervention s to an extent not seen  since the 1930s.  Some \ninstitutions have failed, others have received sizable infusions of taxpayer funds to support their \noperations, and the functioning of some key financial markets now depends heavily on \ngovernment support.  Despite these actions a nd some recent signs of improvement, markets \nremain under stress and the near-term outlook for the financial system and the economy remains \nuncertain.  Clearly, the magnitude, nature and scope of this financial cr isis have posed significant \nchallenges for policymakers here and abroad.  The weakening economy has caused financial \ndifficulties to escalate.  But, in my view, the ru sh to respond has had negative consequences as \nwell.  Without a systematic plan for addressing the crisis, poli cy actions have been ad hoc, \nresulting in inequitable outcomes among firms, creditors and investors that have increased \nuncertainty and undermined confidence.  Nowhere is this more apparent than  in the treatment of \nlarge, complex financial institut ions that have been labeled as  “systemically important” and “too \nbig to fail.” \nToday, I would like to place my recent discussion of the resolution of these large problem \ninstitutions in a somewhat broader context by taking a closer look at how we got into this \ndifficulty and by discussing some of the longer-r un consequences of the actions being taken to \nresolve the crisis.  \n\n3 \n Context for the Crisis  \n Many factors contributed to the financial exces ses that spawned this crisis.  But, at the \nroot of our problems is a collectiv e failure of market discipline and public policy.  Over the past \nthree decades, we have seen enormous growth in financial markets and institutions around the world.  This growth has been spurred by technologi cal advances and financ ial innovation.  But, it \nwas also supported by a philosophy that financial in stitutions and supervis ors have the tools to \nmeasure and control risk while policymakers mainta ined an environment of stable prices and low \ninterest rates.  This philosophy, moreover, led ma ny financial institutions and investors to take \non more leverage, hold less in liquid funds, and downplay the risks of many of the new financial \ninstruments and counterparty rela tionships.  Also, the removal of  certain barriers to geographic \nand activity expansion in banking provided an ad ditional incentive that helped pave the way for \never larger financial institutions, whose failu re could have broad re percussions across the \nfinancial system and the economy. \n This new system of finance relies more heav ily on market discipline to manage risks and \nmaintain stability.  But, as we have seen, ther e have also been factor s that have served to \nundermine market discipline.  These include: the increased complexity of financial instruments; \ninstitutional features that di storted incentives to take, m easure and manage risks; and, \nimportantly, the view that large complex financial institutions would not be  allowed to fail.  I \nthink it is also fair to say that all regulators were compl acent in performing their oversight \nresponsibilities in an environmen t of strong economic growth, low inflation and strong financial \nperformance.    These financial developments were suppor ted by a very favorable macroeconomic \nenvironment, where a decline in inflation worl dwide allowed central banks to maintain low \n\n4 \n interest rates and ample credit av ailability, making debt and leverage  more attractive.  With these \nfavorable financial and macroeconomic devel opments extending over a long period of time -- \npunctuated only occasionally by fina ncial crises in some emerging market economies -- it is not \ntoo surprising that policymakers ignored the nays ayers who warned of weaknesses in this system \nand did not develop a systematic plan for dealing w ith a major financial crisis such as the one we \nare currently confronting. Crisis Resolution\n  \n From this introduction, let me now turn to my view on the resolution of large, complex \nfinancial institutions.  While you may be familiar with some of my more  recent remarks on the \n“too big to fail” issue, I have been concerned with this problem  for some time.  Previously, I \nsaid, “In a world dominated by mega financial in stitutions, governments could be reluctant to \nclose those that become troubled for fear of sy stemic effects on the financial system.  To the \nextent these institutions become too big to fail, and where uninsured depositors and other \ncreditors are protected by implicit government guara ntees, the consequences ca n be quite serious.  \nIndeed, the result may be a less stable and a less efficient financial system .” I also noted that \n“recent history throughout the world suggests that “too big to fail” may be the policy of choice in \ncrisis situations, particularly when mega instituti ons play a large role in a country’s economy and \nfinancial markets.”  I made these comme nts not this year, but in March 1999.1 \nIn recent weeks, I have outlined a resolution framework for how we deal with the large, \nsystemically important institutions at the center of this crisis in the United States.  Boiled down to its simplest elements, the pl an would require those firms seek ing government assistance to put \nthe taxpayer senior to all shareholders with  the impact on managers and directors depending on \n                                                \n \n1 “Financial Industry Megamergers and Policy Challenges,” March 25, 1999.   \nAvailable at: www.kansascityfed.org/home/subwebnav.cfm?level=3&theID=9983&SubWeb=6 \n\n5 \n the viability of the firm.  Nonvi able institutions would be allowed to fail and be placed into a \nnegotiated conservatorship or a bridge institution, with the bad assets liquidated while the \nremainder of the firm is operated under new mana gement and reprivatized as soon as feasible. \nThis plan is similar to what was done in Swed en in the 1990s and what we did in the United \nStates with the failure of Continental Illinois in the 1980s.  \nThis plan has many advantages, including th at management and shareholders bear the \ncosts for their actions before taxpayer funds are committed.  This process also is equitable across \nall firms; is similar to what we now do with sm aller banks; and provides a definitive process for \nreducing market uncertainty.  These all are impor tant reasons we must implement this kind of \nresolution process. \nIn contrast to this suggested approach, a policy of “too big to fail” rais es important issues.  \nFor example, it worsens the already significant problem of moral hazard in which investors do \nnot monitor risk appropriately, assuming, correctly  it would seem, that the government will bail \nthem out of financial problems.  Capitalism is a process of failure and re newal, and a policy that \nundermines this process makes the financia l system and our economy less efficient. \nAlso, when firms are treated as “too big to fail,” they receive an implied subsidy and a \ncompetitive advantage over other firms.  Critics of the approach I suggest have raised three main objections.  Fi rst, they argue that \nthese institutions are too large a nd complex, with many international linkages, to be resolved in a \ntimely manner.  I agree that thes e resolutions would be complex.  But, historical experience also \nshows that forbearance is often more costly, es pecially to the taxpayer, than resolving the \ninstitutions in a timely manner.  Second, critics su ggest the failure of one of these institutions \ncould be very disruptive and worsen the crisis, ci ting Lehman as an example.  I am not at all \n\n6 \n advocating the approach taken with Lehman.  Rather, I am arguing for a timely, managed and \norderly resolution of large, inso lvent institutions, with their ba sic functions continuing under new \nmanagement.  Third, critics suggest that governme nt resolution of these institutions amount to \ntheir “nationalization.”  I believe this is a misn omer, as we are taking a temporary step that is \naimed at cleaning up a limited number of failed institutions and returning to private ownership as soon as possible.  This is something banking agen cies have done many times before with smaller \ninstitutions and, in selected cases, with very large institutions.  In  many ways it is also similar to \nwhat is done during a corporate bankruptcy, but with an emphasis on en suring continuity of \nservices. Longer-term Consequences\n \n In the heat of a financial crisis, policymak ers are in a reactive mode, especially in the \nabsence of a systematic plan to address the cr isis.  In this environment, it is tempting to \ndownplay the longer-term consequences of short-te rm decisions.  But there are some significant \nimplications of the policy actions taken in this crisis that will shape the financial system and the \neconomic environment in the future.  Let me co nclude my remarks today with a discussion of \nsome of the longer-run consequences of  the policy response to this crisis. \n One key issue, of course, is what financial regulatory structure we  want going forward if \nwe are to prevent a repeat of the current crisis on an even larger scal e.  While much of the \ndiscussion about regulatory reform will focus on who should be the regulator of what institution \nor activity, I believe there are two more important i ssues that need to be addressed.  First, what \nshould be the span of regulation an d the federal safety net; that is , which institutions or segments \nof the market should be covered by government  guarantees and other support mechanisms?  \nAlso, how should these entities be regulated to limit safety net e xposure?  A second key issue is \n\n7 \n how should we deal with large, systemically  important financial institutions on a more \npermanent basis?  In this regard, I fear that if we pour in enough public funds to see us through \nthe current crisis, we will then breathe a si gh of relief and back off from implementing any \ncomprehensive solutions to controlling the use of government guarantees and to addressing the \nproblems posed by systemically important institutions.    In my view, this would be a serious mistake.   While a carefully cons tructed safety net and \na better resolution procedure for la rge institutions are critical, we al so need to think about how to \nprevent such institutions from holding us hostage in the future.  This may require breaking them \nup, limiting their activities or size, increasing capita l requirements, or taking other steps to limit \nthe systemic risks they impos e on the financial system.   \n More broadly, however, during this crisis we have seen an enormous extension of \ngovernment guarantees and support to institutions  and markets that had not previously been \ncovered.  Going forward, we must credibly convin ce financial markets and in stitutions that such \ncoverage will not be easily forthcoming in the future .  A key step in accomplishing this is to take \nthe steps that I have suggested to resolve large problem institutions. If we fail to do so, we will \nsee moral hazard problems escalate far beyond th eir current levels, with enormous adverse \nimplications for the efficiency and stability of our financial system. \n This crisis will also have an enormous fis cal cost that will place a large future burden on \ntaxpayers, even as we come closer to the ts unami of looming Social  Security and Medicare \nobligations.  Going forward, we need to ensure that managers, shareholders and creditors of \nfinancial institutions bear the full costs of their ri sk-taking, and I think we need to make it harder \nfor policymakers to pass these costs on to taxpayers. \n\n8 \n  Finally, let me comment on some of the longe r-run implications of the Federal Reserve’s \nrole in the policy response to this crisis.  Th is crisis has involved segments of the financial \nsystem that operate outside of the traditional federal safety net, which has been limited to depository institutions.  In fact, many of the player s in this crisis would not be given access to the \ndiscount window during normal circumstances and ha ve been subject to little in the way of \nprudential supervision.  The Federa l Reserve’s response to this cr isis in providing liquidity and \nsupport to institutions and markets outside of its traditional purview has been significant, creative \nand timely.    However, in stepping outside its normal s phere of operations and making decisions about \nwhich markets and institutions to support, the Federal Reserve has also moved into credit-\nallocation decisions which are more properly pe rformed by the marketplace itself and by fiscal \nauthorities when necessary.  These decisions have  also caused the Federal Reserve to greatly \nexpand its balance sheet and have almost certainly set expectati on for similar responses in any \nfuture crises.  All of this will make it more diffi cult for the Federal Reserve to quickly remove its \npolicy accommodation in the future and, thereby, will subject it to new te sts of its independence \nas a monetary authority. Concluding Comments\n \n We have expended considerable resources addr essing this difficult crisis, but still, we \nhave a ways to go before markets will function ef fectively without government assistance.  In my \nview, this process will go faster  and with less ultimate cost if we  take decisive steps to resolve \ninsolvent institutions in a timely manner, regardless of their size and complexity.  Over the longer term, we face the difficult task of redesigning our system of financial regulation to \nprovide more stability, while main taining innovation and efficienc y.  This is always a difficult \n\n9 \n balance to strike, but it will be nearly impossi ble if we do not address the problems posed by \nlarge, complex financial institutions."

Hoenig \n \nPresident \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \nbefore the \n \nJoint Economic Committee \n \nUnited States Congress \n    \nApril 21, 2009 \n \n     \n\n1 \n Madam Chair Maloney, Vice Chair Schumer,  ranking members Brady and Brownback, \nand members of the committee, I appreciate the o pportunity to talk with you about the issues \nsurrounding the exceptionally large financial institutions whose failure may pose systemic \nthreats to the financial system.  \nThe United States currently faces economic turmoil related dire ctly to a loss of \nconfidence in these large institutions. Although the response to the events of the past year has \ntaken on various forms, so far, we have not seen  the return of confidence and transparency to \nfinancial markets, leaving lenders and invest ors wary of making new commitments. Until that \nfaith is restored, it is impossible fo r us to achieve full economic recovery. \nWhen the crisis began to unfold last year, a nd its full depth was not yet clear, we were \nquick to pump substantial liquidity into the syst em. In the world we find today, with the crisis \ncontinuing and hundreds of thousands of Ameri cans losing their jobs every month, it remains \ntempting to pour additional funds in to these institutions in hope s of a turnaround. We have taken \nthese steps instead of defining a co nsistent plan or addressing the core issue of how to deal with \nthese institutions that now block our path to recovery. Our acti ons so far risk prolonging the \ncrisis while increasing the cost  and raising serious questions about how we eventually unwind \nthese programs without creating another financial crisis as  bad or worse than the one we \ncurrently face. \nThese large and systemically important institu tions are regularly referred to as “too big to \nfail,” but yet we all know that a free market syst em requires that insolvent firms, regardless of \ntheir size, market position or th e complexity of their operations, must fail. We have been \nunwilling to allow this to happen to these firms,  ignoring that we have an existing mechanism \n\n2 \n that can be used for firms of all sizes and allows  for their dissolution while controlling damage to \nthe broader financial system.  \nThere seems to be a prevalent line of thinki ng that the problems we  now face with these \ninstitutions are simply too complex for us to re solve without widespread damage to the financial \nsystem. I don’t think those who managed th e Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the \nResolution Trust Corporation or the Swedish financ ial crisis were provided with a blueprint that \nguaranteed their success. And though I would be th e first to acknowledge that the path I propose \nis not easy, I do not accept the idea that we have lost our ability to solve the challenges we now \nface. \nThis system has a proven track record in the United States as well as abroad and it would \nserve us well in the current crisis. I have included in this written testimony the text of a speech I delivered recently in Tulsa, Okla., that spells out the details of how th is program would work. \nAdditionally, I have included suppl ementary information including further details related to the \nresolution framework for large institutions; th e process used to handle the 1984 failure; of \nContinental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest financial institutions at the time of its \nfailure, and the approach Sweden took in respons e to that nation’s banking crisis in the 1990s, \nwhich is very similar in many ways to wh at we face in the United States today. \nIn addition to the current turmoil, from a re gulatory perspective we must also make the \nchanges necessary to protect the financial system from a similar crisis in the future. For some \ntime, there has been an ongoing debate in th e regulatory community pitting proponents of a \nbroad principles-based approach against those fa voring a more rigid rules-based system that can \nbe widely understood and more readily, and even ly, enforced. The current crisis has made the \ncase that the rules system is our only alternative, as the principles-based approach leaves far too \n\n3 \n much open for the discretion of the firms in question and not enough authority for the various \nregulatory agencies.  \nAlong these same lines, this crisis has been th e first real test of the Basel II capital \nframework, and it has failed miserably. Basel II relies on firms making their own detailed \nassessments of the risks they have assumed so  a capital requirement can  be assigned. I would \ndoubt any of us today would believe such a sy stem to be desirable or even workable. \nEnforcement under Basel II relies on examin ers understanding and evaluating extremely \ncomplex mathematical models. When it becomes clear that these models understate capital \nneeds, examiners often have difficulty arguing the technical merits of their views and convincing \nbank management to add capital. In many ways, Basel II provides banks with a rationale, a \ndefense and an opportunity for taking excessive leverage. Banks have strong competitive and financial incentives to increase leverage. Duri ng good times, leverage increases profitability, but \nit also increases risk. We have seen the broad systemic effects of excessive leverage. To limit \nsuch problems in the future, we must maintain limits on financial levera ge through strict rules \nsetting minimum capital-to-asset rati os. It would be the easiest, mo st equitable and clear-cut way \nto set capital requirements for all sizes of ba nks and for a broader range of firms throughout \nfinancial markets. \nOne of the more troubling aspects of this cris is has been that in many ways these events \nhave not been unpredictable. A decade ago, I and others anticipated that the financial \nmegamergers we were seeing at th at time would lead to a situa tion like the one we face today. \nAlthough we did not have any way of knowi ng the events that would provide the \nstimulus for this crisis, there were already c oncerns in 1999 that, “In a world dominated by mega \nfinancial institutions, governments could be reluctan t to close those that b ecome troubled for fear \n\n4 \n of systemic effects on the financial system. To the extent these institutions become ‘too big to \nfail,’ and where uninsured depositors and othe r creditors are protec ted by implicit government \nguarantees, the consequences can be quite serious.  Indeed, the result may be a less stable and a \nless efficient financial system.”1 \nThis is clearly the result we now face, and it is even more pressing that we deal with the \nproblem at hand in a manner that brings stability and transparency back into our system for the \ncurrent environment or it is a certainty that this is an environment in which we will find ourselves yet again.   \n                                                \n \n1 “Financial Industry Megamergers an d Policy Challenges,” speech by Thomas  M.

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n        \nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce \nTulsa, Oklahoma \nApril 9, 2009 \n \n\n6 \n  \n \nAs you all know, we are in the middle of a ve ry serious financial cr isis, and our economy \nis under significant stress. Ther e has been much debate abou t how we should address these \nchallenges, but regardless of the method one supports, all agree that  the economy will not \nrecover until the financial system is st abilized and credit flows improve.   \nThe restoration of normal financial market activity depends on how we deal with the \nproblems of our largest fina ncial institutions. It is has been a li ttle more than a year since the first \nmajor government rescue occurred with Bear Stearns being acquired by JPMorgan. Since then, \nnumerous programs have been enacted and trill ions of dollars of pub lic funds have been \ncommitted, much of it directly to our largest inst itutions. Despite these well-intentioned efforts, \nthe problems remain, and the public’s dissatisfacti on with how their money is being spent grows.  \nIt is not surprising that the initial measures ta ken in this crisis were ad hoc. The depth and \nextent of the problems were not anticipated. Ho wever, more than a year has passed and the \nchallenge that still remains is to define a pl an that addresses the si gnificant asset problems \nembedded in our largest instituti ons. We must provide financial firms, investors and consumers \nwith a clear and fair plan for dealing with  firms that many call “too big to fail.”   \nLast month, I gave a speech that outlined a resolution framework and a plan for how we \nshould deal with these large system ically important financial firms. I believe that failure is an \noption. Those who disagree with my resolution proposal  say that it is unwor kable. In my remarks \ntoday, I will offer more details about how the process would work and explain why I think it is \nthe best solution for getting our financial system and economy on the road to recovery. \n  \n\n7 \n  \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework  \nFor a free market system to be successful , firms must be allowed to fail based upon a \npredefined set of rules and principles that market  participants can rely on when determining their \nstrategies and making decisions. This is particularly important for problem financial institutions. These key principles should a pply if we are talking about a small bank in Tulsa or a large \ninternational financial conglom erate in New York City.   \nThe first principle is to properly understand our goals and correctly identify the problems \nwe are attempting to solve. This may sound obviou s. However, when we are in the middle of a \ncrisis where more than a half million people are losing their jobs every month, it is tempting to \npour money into the institutions thinking that it will correct the problem and get credit flowing \nonce again. Also, rather than letting the market  system objectively discipline the firms through \nfailure and stockholder loss, we tend to microm anage the institutions and punish those within \nreach.  \nThis lack of confidence in the market’s re medy is most acute for our largest financial \ninstitutions, which have publically  disclosed substantial losses. Th e question that the supervisory \nauthorities must answer is whethe r the losses are large enough to th reaten the solvency of any of \nthese firms. This assessment is the first step in  determining actions necessary to restoring public \nconfidence in our financial system.  \nA second principle is that we must do what is best for the overall economy and not what \nis best for one group. We need to make sure th at when one financial firm fails, the resolution \nprocess does not cause significant disruptions to financial market s and the economy or make the \n\n8 \n current problems worse. Furthermore, we must do it for the lowest possible cost so that we don’t \ncreate a long-term fis cal burden on taxpayers. \nIt is important to recognize that there are not  just the direct cost s but, more importantly, \nlong-term costs to the economy and financial syst em. The direct cost of resolving a failed bank, \nsuch as the government bearing some of a failed ba nk’s losses, is simple to determine. However, \nit is much more difficult to know the costs fr om some of the unintended consequences. For \nexample, market discipline is reduced when a resolution process does not make management, \nshareholders and creditors bear the costs of their actions. \nThe third principle is equity of treatment. Regardless of an institution’s size, complexity \nor location, the resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers. The pr ocess must be transparent and clearly stated \nso that everyone understands wh at to expect if they gamble  with the firm’s assets.  \nWhen talking about equity of treatment, it is important to recognize that a single process \ncan lead to different outcomes. For example, if any bank is examined and found to be insolvent, \nit needs to go through the resolu tion process with the owners lo sing their investment. However, \nthe eventual outcomes for the institution can be different. A smaller bank’s assets and deposits \nwill likely be sold to another bank. In the case of  a larger bank, the firm might be temporarily \noperated as a bridge bank before e ither being sold or reprivatized. Regardless, it is important that \nthe banks go through the same process or else an  incentive will be created for banks to take on \nexcessive risks in an effort to grow large enough to gain favorable treatment. \nA final principle is that we must base the resolution process on facts about what works \nand what does not work. One way to do this is to l ook at past financial crises . This is not the first \n\n9 \n financial crisis, and we can learn a lot about what  will and will not be successful by looking back \nat our own history with financial crises, as we ll as at the experiences in other countries.   \n \nIdentifying the Problem  \nWith these principles in mi nd, how should we go about resolving the current problems at \nour largest institutions?   \nFirst, we must determine both the location a nd size of the losses. Admittedly, it will not \nbe easy. These firms are very large – the four largest bank holding comp anies each have more \nthan  $1 trillion of assets, which accounts for about half of the banking industry’s assets. They have offices around the world, and they are involv ed in many complex businesses. But in order \nto repair the financial system, we must get the best estimates of the condition and viability of \nthese firms, and we must require them to reflect  their losses in their financial statements.   \nNormally, we think of a business’ solvency in  terms of the value of its equity capital.  \nWhen the value of its assets is less than the valu e of its liabilities, it has negative equity and it \nhas failed. A financial firm, however, can also fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current \npayment obligations, either because it can’t sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing \nliabilities, or it loses market c onfidence and cannot borrow enough.   \nI would note that these are concrete definitio ns and not subjective conditions.  I mention \nthis because it points out that the term “too big to fail” is a misst atement. It does not matter what \nsize the firm is. Although a bank might still be open and operating, if it is insolvent by these \ndefinitions, it has failed.   \n\n10 \n Once we determine a bank’s status, we would classify these institutions into three \ncategories, depending on whether they are solvent and what their prospects are for continuing as \nan ongoing concern.  \nThe first category would be firms whose opera tions are strong and whose equity remains \nabove minimum requirements. These firms would not require much government support, if any.  \nSome might need to raise additional capital to pr ovide a greater cushion against the losses they \nmay suffer during the current crisis. But these inst itutions are basically sound and should be able \nto raise private capital. \nThe second category would be those instituti ons whose equity temporarily falls below \nminimum requirements but are expe cted to recover in a reasonabl e period of time as economic \nconditions improve. These firms have generally  sound management, who may have made some \nmistakes and suffered greater losses than norma l due to the economic dow nturn. It is reasonable \nto expect these banks to raise additional privat e capital. However, the government may need to \nprovide some capital in the form of preferred sh ares and possibly some warrants in return. As an \nequity holder, the government woul d have an oversight role rega rding the firms’ operations and \nactivities. \nThe final category is for the institutions th at are no longer viable either because of \nliquidity problems or their equity capital is curren tly negative or it is like ly to become negative, \nbased on reasonable expectations of future market and economic conditions. These firms, which would likely soon become equity insolvent wi thout government protections and guarantees, \nwould be declared insolvent by th e regulatory authority. Shareholde rs would be forced to bear \nthe full cost of the positions they have taken a nd risk losing their invest ment. Senior management \nand the board of directors would be replaced becaus e they are responsible fo r the failed strategy.   \n\n11 \n  \nA Resolution Process \nThe question then becomes how to resolve th ese failed institutions while minimizing the \ncost and disruption to the economy.  \nThe method most often used when a bank fails is to arrange for a sale of its assets and an \nassumption of its liabilities by another institutio n. For these extremely large firms, there are a \ncouple of significant roadblocks pr eventing this solution. First, th e acquiring firm must have the \ncapacity for the acquisition, which m eans it would have to be in the same size range as the failed \ninstitution. And secondly, if such a deal was forg ed, it would create an ev en larger firm with \ngreater systemic risks to the economy.   \nInstead, an extremely large firm that has faile d would have to be temporarily operated as \na conservatorship or a bridge or ganization and then reprivatized as quickly as is economically \nfeasible. We cannot simply add more capital w ithout a change in the firm’s ownership and \nmanagement and expect different outcomes in the future. \nExperience shows that this approach has wo rked. The best example was with the failure \nof Continental Illinois National Bank and its  holding company in 1984. Because we are in \nOklahoma today, I will note that Continental’s pr oblems began with some bad loans it purchased \nfrom Oklahoma City’s Penn Square Bank. As an o fficer in our Bank’s regul atory function at that \ntime, I was directly involved in the closi ng of Penn Square. In fact, from 1982 to 1992, 347 \nbanks failed or received FDIC assistance in th e Tenth Federal Reserve District states. I was \ninvolved in almost every one of these resolutions and all were tr agedies. I tell you this to make \nclear that I do not take this proposal lightly nor do I expect any size bank failure to be easy or \n\n12 \n painless. But the process that worked for Continen tal Illinois is a viable approach to addressing \nimportant aspects of today’s crisis. \nAt the time of its failure, Continental Illinois had $40 bill ion in assets and was the \nnation’s largest commercial and industrial lender. It was the seventh- la rgest bank in the United \nStates.  It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a large network of domestic and \ninternational correspondent rela tionships, and a separate function for making residential and \ncommercial real estate loans. It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.   \nWhen Continental failed, its top manageme nt and directors were replaced with \nindividuals who had experien ce operating large, complex or ganizations. John Swearingen, \nformer chairman of Standard Oil of Indian a, became CEO of the hol ding company, and William \nOgden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, became CEO. \nThe FDIC committed to taking a book value of $4.5 billion of bad assets off of \nContinental’s balance sheet and pl aced them in a separate work- out unit to recover as much of \nthe value of the assets as possible. Among those ba d assets, $1 billion was written off as a loss at \nthe time of the transaction. \nTo offset the $1 billion loss to Continenta l’s capital, the FDIC provided $1 billion in \ncapital in exchange for preferred stock, of which $720 million was convertible to common stock \nupon sale. When converted, the $720 million would amount to a 79.9 percent ownership stake in \nContinental.   \nThe FDIC also received five-year warrants  to purchase the remaining common stock for \nfar below one cent per share ($0.00001).  If at the end of five years,  the cost of the resolution was \nmore than $800 million, the FDIC would exercise  100 percent of the warr ants; if losses were \nlower, the amount of warrants exercised would be  in proportion to the amount of the losses.   \n\n13 \n To economize on FDIC staff and to provide ad ditional expertise, the loan liquidation unit \nwas staffed by a combination of FDIC personnel,  hired specialists and Continental employees \nunder incentive contracts. \nContinental Illinois was fully reprivatized by 1991 and eventually purchased by Bank of \nAmerica in 1994. The FDIC exercised all of the wa rrants so the shareholders in Continental’s \nholding company effectively lost their entire inve stment. The FDIC sold all of the preferred \nshares and shares from exercising the warrant s for $1.2 billion, which was a net gain of $200 \nmillion. The FDIC also earned $200 million in divi dends. The ultimate resolution cost to the \nFDIC was $1.1 billion, which was 3.28 percent of Continental’s assets  at the time of resolution. \nThere has been much talk lately about a new resolution process for systemically \nimportant firms that Congress could enact, and I would encourage this be implemented as \nquickly as possible, but we do not have to wait  for new authority. We can act immediately, using \nessentially the same steps we used for Continental.  \nStock could be issued and control assumed by a government entity. A bridge institution \ncould be created within the inst itution so essential services an d operations would continue as \nnormal. Where necessary, the government would provi de capital in exchange for preferred shares \nconvertible to common stock upon sale. Existing shareholders would provide the government \nwarrants to purchase all outstanding shares wi th the amount exercised determined by the \ngovernment’s resolution cost. Senior manage ment and directors would be replaced.  \nThe most difficult part of re solving these large firms without  a new resolution process is \nhow to make creditors bear the cost of their positions. Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing \nobligations would be addressed and dealt with  according to the cove nants and contractual \npriorities set up for each type of debt. Insure d creditors would have immediate access to their \n\n14 \n funds, while other creditors would have immediat e access to maturing funds  with the potential \nfor haircuts, depending on exp ected recoveries, any collatera l protection and likely market \nimpact. However, this is difficu lt because it would require negotia ting with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial firm \ninsolvent. \n Regardless of how the firm is resolved, short- term liabilities in par ticular would need to \nbe addressed immediately because of their impor tance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment \nobligations and operational needs.  Quick decisi ons should also be made on all counterparty \narrangements because of the widespread impact that uncertainty would have on the counterparties.   \nAuthorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, whether the losses \nassociated with this outcome would lead to a lo ss of confidence in financial markets and serious \nfunding problems that would threaten the viabilit y of other financial firms. If so, it may be \nnecessary to honor all co unterparty arrangements and/or short- term liabilities, as we did with \nContinental Illinois.   \nHowever, this guarantee must be considered as an exception to the normal process.  \nCongress would have to enact an approval process similar to the sy stemic exception for banks as \nspecified in the 1991 FDIC Improvement Act, re quiring approval by two-th irds of the Federal \nReserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the president.   \nAs much as I dislike extending government  guarantees and thereby reducing market \ndiscipline, if we were to implement this excep tion, I believe we would also need to extend the \n\n15 \n same guarantees to all other institutions or we would give failed institutions a competitive \nadvantage.   \nAnother key part of the resolution is that the bad assets need to be taken off the balance \nsheet of the failed institution at realistic mark et values and placed in an asset management \ncompany, resulting in two entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”  Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work them out.  \nAfter writing off the bad assets, the governme nt would provide the “good bank” with enough \ncapital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and at tractive to private investors for \nreprivatization. Any recoveries from the bad bank  would first go toward paying off the costs of \nthe government, and any proceeds left over would be  distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \nThe separation of the bad assets is cr itical. When a bank has a large share of \nnonperforming assets, they remain a burden when they  are left on the balance sheet, even if they \nare written down appropriately. For example, they must be funded although they are not \nproducing income. Such a circumstance creates un certainty about the bank ’s financial condition \nand diverts management’s attention from the business objectives necessary for recovery. The \nfocus of the “good bank” must be on the fu ture, gaining new customers and expanding \noperations, while the goal of the “bad bank” mu st be on getting rid of customers and winding \ndown the operations.      \nAs part of the reprivatization process, it is also important to  determine the advisability of \nbreaking up or selling off operati ons and independent subsidiaries  where possible, especially \ngiven the market discipline problems we have en countered with institutions  regarded as “too big \nto fail.” Moreover, assessing the condition and vi ability of large, complex financial firms is \n\n16 \n difficult, and the failure of such a firm may be an indication that it is also too large and complex \nto manage well. We should avoid setting conditions that only repeat past mistakes in creating too \nbig and too complex an institution. \nThis system is clearly more equitable than what we have seen so far.  At the start of the TARP I program, $125 b illion was provided to  the nine largest \nfinancial firms without an in-d epth, thorough exam of their cond ition.  However, all other banks \nreceived TARP funds only if their primary regulator conclude d they were strong enough to \nweather the crisis and conti nue as an ongoing concern.   \nThe $10 per share that Bear Stearns’ stockhol ders received from the JPMorgan Chase \nacquisition would not have been possible withou t the government’s guarantee of $29 billion of \nproblem assets. Additionally, the governme nt has committed $173 billion to support AIG’s \ncontinued operations, with their shareholders st anding to reap financial gain if AIG ultimately \nrecovers.  \nMeanwhile, 46 banks in the United States ha ve failed since the be ginning of 2008. All of \nthem were resolved through one of the bank reso lution problems I have discussed here today.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \nIt is understandable that there are concerns about letting these large firms fail, but it \nshould be noted that the program I have just described has a record of success elsewhere. \nThe economic situation in Sweden in the earl y 1990s was similar to that in the United \nStates today. Its financial sy stem was dominated by six larg e banks that accounted for 90 \npercent of the industry’s assets. Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major \nfinancial institutions. The viable Swedish ba nks were soon recapitalized, largely through \n\n17 \n private sources, and public authorities quickly took over two large insolv ent banks and spun off \ntheir bad assets to be managed within a separa te entity. Sweden was able to systematically \nrestore confidence in its financ ial system, and although it took se veral years to work down and \nsell off all of the bad assets, there was minimal net cost to the taxpayers.   \nSome argue that the Swedish situation is not a valid comparison because it only dealt \nwith only six banks. In addition, some argue th at the Swedish system was much less complex, \nand that the Swedish government had to work out primarily commercial real estate loans instead \nof the complex financial assets, st ructured securities and derivatives  that we would have to work \nout today.    \nThese are valid concerns, but I would point out, first, that although the United States has \nseveral thousand banks, only 19 have more than $100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory \nauthorities evaluate their condition, it is lik ely that few would requi re further government \nintervention. Second, as for complexity, I would point out that real es tate assets involve \nconsiderable complexity, no less so than many financial derivatives. \nAnother important example is the Reconstruc tion Finance Corporation (RFC), which was \nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC followed a \nprocess very similar to what I have described. It began by examining pr oblem banks and writing \ndown the bad assets to realistic economic values , making any needed and appropriate changes in \nbank management, injecting public equity as needed  into these banks, and returning the banks to \nprivate ownership. The RFC proved to be high ly successful in recapitalizing banks, and like \nSweden, there was essentially no net cost to ta xpayers. More detailed information on both the \nContinental Illinois and Swedish models for large bank resolution will be posted today with a \ntext of my remarks on our Bank’s website at Ka nsasCityFed.org. Absent a detailed explanation \n\n18 \n of why this approach can’t be done, it is my hope that it will be useful to  provide more details \naround my view that it can be done. \nLet me make two final points.   First, the debate over the resolution of the la rgest financial firms is  often sensationalized \nbecause it is framed in terms of nationalizing fa iled institutions. It is also pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \nIn response, I would note that no firm w ould be nationalized in this program.  \nNationalization is the process of  the government taking over a going concern with the intent of \noperating it. Though a bridge instit ution is the most likely outcom e when a large financial firm \nfails, the goal is for the firm to  be reprivatized as quickly as possible. In addition, subject to \nregulatory agency oversight, the bridge firm would be managed by private sector managers \nselected for their experience in operating we ll-run, large, complex organizations.    \nThe second point is related to the complexity is sue, which is that it would be hard to find \nenough people with the required knowledge, experi ence and skills to fill the open positions.  \nGoing back to the Continental Illinois example, we  were able to do it then. More generally: The \nUnited States is a vast country with a treme ndous amount of management resources in a broad-\nbased economic and industrial system. If the United States does not have th e talent to run these \nfirms, then we are much worse off than I thought. I refuse to accept that conclusion. \n  \n\n19 \n  \n \n \nMATERIALS REFERENCED  IN THE SPEECH: \n \nSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE \n \n \n  \n• A Resolution Process for Financial Firms \n \n• Assistance for Continental Illinois \n \n• Swedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• References \n \n    \n \n \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n        \nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce \nTulsa, Oklahoma \nApril 9, 2009 \n  \n \n\n20 \n A Resolution Process for Financial Firms \n \n• The United States is in the middle of a seri ous financial crisis, and the economy is under \nsignificant stress. While there has been a lot of  debate about how to revive the economy and \nrestore financial stability, there is broad ag reement that the economy will not recover until \nthe financial system is stabilized a nd credit starts flowing more normally. \n \n• The recovery of the financial system depends  critically on the public  regaining trust and \nconfidence in financial institutions, particularly the largest financial in stitutions. The public’s \nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken, \nthe poor management of those risks and the resu lting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal \nfinancial market activity depends importantly  on how the problems of the largest bank and \nnonbank financial instituti ons are addressed.   \n \n• Despite the best of intentions, the policies and ac tions directed at restor ing the health of the \nfinancial system have not been c onsistent or transparent. It is  understandable that the initial \nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because  the depth and breadth of the problems were \nnot expected and there were no plans in  place for addressing the problems.   \n \n• The solution must be a clear and fair plan so  that financial firms, investors and consumers \nknow what to expect when any financial institu tion runs into problems. Specifically, the plan \nmust provide a process for how policymakers will  address the deterioration of the financial \ncondition of all financial firms,  regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become \ninsolvent.    \n• A resolution process is part icularly important for the largest, most complex and \ninterconnected institutions because they have be en considered by many as “too big to fail,” at \nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution pro cess that can be used for any \nfinancial firm involved in the intermediation pr ocess or payments system, but the focus is on \nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too big to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the be st solution for the economy.   \n \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework \n \n• A free market system requires that business ow ners capture the profits from their successes \nand bear the costs of their failures. Firms that me et the market test will grow, while those that \ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowe d to go out of business if they fail. The \nconsequences of failure and the resolution fram ework must be clearly stated and transparent \nso that business owners have cl ear expectations about the cons equences of their actions.   \n \n• The resolution framework must pr escribe a predefined set of ru les, guided by an agreed upon \nset of principles. This is particularly important  for financial institutions, big or small, because \ntheir success depends critically  on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable, \nongoing concern.  \n \n  \n\n21 \n • There are two key principles that the resolution process should follow. \n \n• First, the resolution process should minimi ze the cost to the overall economy.   \n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant \nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems. \n- The process should minimize the cost of reso lving an insolvency to avoid a long-term \nfiscal burden on taxpayers.  \n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and \nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.  \n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, su ch as the government bearing some of the \nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.   \n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly \nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.   \n- To minimize the future cost to the econom y, the resolution process must not create \nadverse incentives that are inconsistent w ith economic efficiency.  Specifically, the \nresolution process must not allow a firm’s management, shareholders and creditors to \navoid the consequences of their mistakes b ecause it reduces market discipline, creates \nadverse incentives for firms to take too much  risk, and inefficientl y directs resources and \nfinancial capital to less-productive uses. \n- The process must be transparen t and clearly stated so that  everyone understands what to \nexpect and the consequences of their actio ns. Management must know beforehand what \nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant, \nnegative effect on the firm ’s financial condition. \n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution pr ocess should be based on solid research and \ninformation about what works and what doe s not work. Policymakers can learn a lot \nabout what will and will not be  successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial \ncrises, as well as at cris es in other countries.   \n \n• The second principle is the resolu tion process must be equitable in  that it is the same for all \nfinancial firms regardless of size or locati on, although it is possible that the outcome will \ndiffer.  \n-  The resolution process must provide cons istent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers,  regardless of the institution’s size, \ncomplexity or location.   \n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the differe nce between process \nand outcome.   \n- For example, if a bank is examined and f ound to be insolvent, the bank should go through \nthe resolution process and the owners shoul d lose their investment regardless of the \nbank’s size.  The outcome may be that a rela tively small bank is resolved by another \ninstitution purchasing its assets  and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is \ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank. \n- In both cases, the banks go through the same pr ocess of being declared insolvent and the \nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.   \n- Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risk s just to grow to a size large enough to \nreceive favorable treatment, and customers ma y choose to go with a large bank instead of \na small bank. \n\n22 \n  \nOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution  \n \n• There are several options for resolving a faile d firm, but it is important to first define \ninsolvency. \n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its co mmon equity capital is negative – that is, the \nfirm’s outstanding liabilities owed  to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets. \n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a posi tive amount of equity capital, is not viable \nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to  meet its current payment obligations, either \nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to  pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses \nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.   \n- It is important to note that these are defi nitions of insolvency and are not subjective \nconditions, which points out that the term “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It \ndoes not matter what size a firm is – if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.  \n• The question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?   \n \n• One option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to main tain ongoing operations \nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment \nobligations.   - In this case, nothing is actual ly resolved, and the insolvent firm is essentially bailed out \nso that it can continue normal operations.  \n- This option may be used for a large financial firm that is consider ed “too big to fail” \nbecause of concerns that it is  systemically important, in th e sense that other resolution \nmethods would have large, negati ve spillover effects on economy.   \n- Under this option, the term “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve” \nbecause of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and \nfinancial system. \n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; curren t shareholders do not \nlose their investment, alt hough the government may impose some restrictions on the \nfirm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses. \n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of th e first principle of minimizing costs.   \n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not \nimmediately cause further problems, it sets th e stage for significant future problems. In a \nbailout, senior management, directors and curr ent shareholders stand to reap any gains \nthat may result, which weakens market discip line and creates the moral hazard that the \nfirm will take too much risk.   \n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and \nnot for smaller firms that are not expected to  cause spillover effect s if other resolution \nmethods are used. \n \n•\n Alternatively, bank regulators have for years us ed a variety of options to resolve insolvent \nbanks. These options include: - liquidation,  \n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s asse ts and assumption of its  liabilities by another \ninstitution,  \n\n23 \n - or operating the bank for a short period of  time through open-bank assistance or as a \nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of \nprivate investors. \n \n• When most people think of a firm as failing, th ey generally think the firm is shut down and \nliquidated.   \n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed  as a receiver and it pays off insured \ndepositors up to the deposit insurance limit. \n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid pa rtial amounts based on expected recoveries. \n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets  by selling them or holding on to them and \nworking them out. The proceeds from the asse ts are used to first pay remaining amounts \nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecure d creditors, and if a nything is left over, \nto shareholders.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they \nmay have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts. \n- While liquidation strongly enforces market di scipline and does not promote moral hazard, \nit tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and \ntherefore is the least desirable choice.   \n- This option is disruptive for individuals and business custom ers because they tend to hold \nshort-term instruments, such as deposits a nd commercial paper, for making payments or \nas a temporary way of storing their f unds. Many business customers also have \ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when \nthe bank is liquidated. \n \n• The resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumpti on (P&A) transaction, \nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another ba nk to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and \nassume its liabilities.   - In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution \nmethod because the FDIC may receive a prem ium from the acquiring bank. And even if \nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assu me the liabilities, it is often less costly \nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquida te the failed bank’s \nassets. \n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy. \n- Short-term creditors and count erparties have immediate acces s to all insured deposits and \nat least a large portion of uninsured obligati ons, while borrowers continue to have access \nto credit.   \n- In addition, because management and director s are replaced and shareholders lose their \ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not re duce market discipline or create adverse \nincentives for bank management and shareholders.    \n• While a P&A transaction is often the best optio n for most failed banks, it generally is not the \nbest option if one of the largest financial inst itutions fails because it creates even larger \ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.   - A major difficulty in the current financial cr isis has been that some institutions are so \nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no \nmatter what option is used.   \n\n24 \n - Only another institution in the same size range  would have the capacity and resources to \npurchase the assets and assume the liabil ities of another large institution.   \n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been se veral examples of large institutions taking \nover other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if in stitutions can get “too \nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, th e resolution process shoul d not result in even \nlarger institutions.  \n• The final option, which is the most feasible fo r a large, complex financial institution that \nfails, is to run it temporarily as a cons ervatorship or bri dge organization.   \n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy. \n- This option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to \nconduct the necessary due diligence. \n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible. \n- As will be discussed below, management, shar eholders and creditors would be forced to \nbear the full cost of their actions and positio ns they have taken to maintain market \ndiscipline and economic efficiency.   \n \n• One of the difficulties with all of these options  is that while there are time-tested, fast \nresolution processes in place for depository inst itutions, today’s largest financial institutions \nare conglomerate financial holdi ng companies with many financia l subsidiaries that are not \nbanks.   - The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option \nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bank ruptcy process.   \n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete – sometimes years – which \nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it  can continue normal operations while in \nbankruptcy.   \n- It does not work for financial firms, however , because they have a variety of complex, \nshort-term liabilities and counterparty a rrangements that customers depend on for \nmaintaining daily operations.  A long, draw n-out bankruptcy pro ceeding would prevent \ncustomers and counterparties from having access to their funds, which would cause \nsignificant economic disruptions. \n- In addition, the cornerstone of  a financial institution’s fran chise value is trust in its \nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sure to quickly erode in a long, drawn-\nout bankruptcy proceeding.   \n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding comp anies quickly and in a way that minimizes \nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a \nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.   \n \n• \nEnacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the \nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and shoul d act immediately to \nresolve a large financial company should one fail. \n \n    \n\n25 \n A Proposed Resolution Process \n \n• The resolution process discussed below is applicable  to any financial firm that is part of the \nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the \nfocus is on systemically important financial in stitutions that are f ound to be insolvent. \n \n• To prevent systemic disruptions to the econom y, a failed institution should be allowed to \ncontinue its operations through a bridge instituti on or conservatorship so  that all essential \nservices and operations would go on as normal.   - Because the firm is insolvent, it would need  additional capital to continue operating.   \n- To recapitalize the firm, the government c ould provide the capital in exchange for \npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.   \n \n• In general, the supervisory authorities would not  have the authority to declare the institution \ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management a nd shareholders bear the costs of their actions \nand investment decisions, the government ’s investment would be conditional on: \n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure. \n- Existing shareholders providing the governme nt warrants to purchase all outstanding \nshares, with the amount exercised determined  by the net costs of resolving the firm. \n- While shareholders may be reluctant to agre e to these conditions, in most cases, they \nwould have little choice give n the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance. \n \n• The specific steps to be taken would depend on seve ral factors, such as the type of financial \norganization and the supervisor’s  existing legal authority.   \n For example, if a holding company’s primar y asset is an insured bank and the bank and \nholding company become insolvent, the bank co uld be closed and the FDIC could set up \na bridge bank.   \n In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervis ory authorities could \ntake actions to mitigate the imp act on the rest of the economy.  \n \n• The most difficult part of reso lving these large firms without a new resolution process is how \nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.   \n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing oblig ations would be addressed and dealt with \naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.   \n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would \nhave immediate access to matu ring funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on \nexpected recoveries, any collateral pr otection and likely market impact.   \n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulator y authorities to decl are a nonbank financial \nfirm insolvent. \n \n• Regardless of how the firm is re solved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors \nwill be treated. \n- Short-term liabilities in partic ular would need to be addressed immediately because of \ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’  daily payment obligations and operations \nneeds.   \n\n26 \n - Quick decisions also need to be made on a ll counterparty arrangements because of the \nwidespread impact that uncerta inty about their status or default would have on their \ncounterparties.   \n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of  their decisions and market discipline is \nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in \nline behind more senior cred itors as the claims on the bank are resolved.   \n- However, the authorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, \nwhether the losses associated w ith this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in \nfinancial markets and serious funding problems th at would threaten th e viability of other \nfinancial firms.  \n \n• In a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short-\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prev ent a systemic disruption to the \neconomy.   - However, this guarantee should be considered  as a “systemic” exception to the normal \nprocess.   \n- To limit the use of this exception to truly sy stemic situations, C ongress should enact an \napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991 \nFDIC Improvement Act.   \n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds \nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Tr easury, in consultation w ith the president.  \n- In addition, though the extension of government  guarantees and the re sulting reduction in \nmarket discipline should generally be avoi ded, extension of the same guarantees would \nneed to be made to every other institution. Otherwise, failed instit utions would have a \ncompetitive advantage over sound institutions, which clearly violates the principle of \nequitable treatment.   \n \n• Another key part of the resoluti on is the bad assets need to be  taken off the balance sheet of \nthe failed institution at realistic market values.   \n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting \nin two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”   \n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the r eceiver could take the bad assets and work \nthem out.   \n- After writing off the bad assets, the gove rnment would provide the good bank with \nenough capital so that it can become a pr ofitable ongoing concern and attractive to \nprivate investors for even tual reprivatization.   \n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would firs t go toward paying off the costs of the \ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \n \n• The separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forwar d-looking process for recovery \nand the eventual reprivat ization of the good bank.   \n- When a bank has a large share of nonperforming  assets, they remain a burden when they \nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.   \n- For example, they still have to be funde d even though they are not producing income, \nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s fi nancial condition, and they divert a lot of \n\n27 \n management’s attention from more productiv e activities for the future growth and \nprofitability of the bank.   \n- In addition, the business objectiv es and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and \nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills for running an ongoing financial firm.   \n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand \noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is  to get rid of customers and wind down the \noperations.      \n \n• As part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory author ities should consider breaking up \nor selling off operations and indepe ndent subsidiaries where possible. \n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market \ndiscipline problems.   \n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication th at it is too large and \ncomplex to manage well.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \n \n• A variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest fina ncial firms fail. These \nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However, \nthe resolution process being advocated he re has a record of success elsewhere.  \n \n• First, the proposed resolution pr ocess is exactly what the Swed es did to solve an equally \nsevere banking crisis that they had in the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to \n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed descri ption of the Swedish crisis and resolution \nprocess).   \n The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was \ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.   \n Sweden took decisive steps to identify lo sses in its major financial institutions.   \n The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and \npublic authorities quickly t ook over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad \nassets to be managed within  a separate entity.    \n Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its fina ncial system, and although it took \nseveral years to work down and sell off all of  the bad assets, there was essentially no net \ncost to the taxpayers.   \n Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were \nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors \nand other unsecured creditors.   \n \n• Some people do not think that the Swedish situ ation is a valid comparison because it dealt \nwith only six banks.  In addition, some argue  that the Swedish system was much less \ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans, \nnot the complex financial assets, such as stru ctured securities and de rivatives, that would \nhave to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail.  While these concerns are valid, it shou ld be noted that:   \n\n28 \n - Although the United States has several thous and banks, only 19 banks have more than \n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is \nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.   \n- It is actually very difficult to work out pr oblems on real estate assets, and it is not \nnecessarily more difficult to work  out even complex securities.  \n \n• As an aside, an additional lesson that can be le arned from Sweden is th at a resolution process \nis much more likely to succeed if it has broa d political support and is structured to be \nindependent of the political process.   o The plan should be put largely under the c ontrol of independent supervisory agencies. \no Political involvement should be confined la rgely to specifying the program’s goals and \nbasic rules.   \no The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the \nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces  the need for political involvement. \n \n• A second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstructi on Finance Corporation \n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems  in the United States in the 1930s.   \n- The RFC began by examining problem banks a nd writing down the bad assets to realistic \neconomic values. \n- It then made any needed and appropriate  changes in bank management and provided \npublic equity capital as needed. \n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its \ncosts.  \n• A final example is the failure of Continenta l Illinois National Bank a nd its holding company \nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution \nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed pr ocess.  In addition, it is an \nexample of a resolution of  a large, complex, interconnected holding company. \n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial a nd industrial lender and the \nseventh- largest U.S. bank.  It had 57 offi ces in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a \nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent re lationships, and a separate \nfunction for making residential and commercial  real estate loans.  It also provided \nspecialized services to a variety of companies.   \n- The attached document, “Assistance for Con tinental Illinois,” provides details about the \nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company. \n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the \nholding company shareholders lo st their entire investment, and the bank was restored to \nsound condition and returned  to private ownership. \n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns \nabout the systemic consequences of impos ing losses on uninsured depositors and other \nunsecured creditors.    \n• Another concern that has been ra ised about letting the largest fi nancial firms fail is that it \nnationalizes these institutions.  As  part of this concern, it is  also often pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \n In the proposed process, no firm  would be nationalized.   \n\n29 \n  Nationalization is the proce ss of the government taking ove r a going concern with the \nintent of continued ownership.   \n Though a bridge institution is the most likely ou tcome for a large financial firm that fails, \nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized  as quickly as possible, subject to the \ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.   \n In addition, subject to regulatory agency overs ight, the bridge firm would be managed by \nprivate sector managers selected for th eir experience in operating well-run, large, \ncomplex organizations.    \n \n• Some opponents to the proposed process also cl aim it would be very difficult to take over \nthese firms and bring in new management becau se they are too complex to manage, as well \nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, a nd skills to fill the \nopen positions.   o The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with \nexperience running large, complex organizations.   \no In addition, while the institution might be co mplex, a new management team is clearly \nbetter than leaving the institution under the c ontrol of the management team that caused it \nto fail in the first place.   \no More generally, it is hard to believe that th ere is not enough talent, either from the United \nStates or other countries, to run these organizations. \n                        \n \n \n\n30 \n Assistance for Continental Illinois \n \nI. Problems at Continental Illinois \n \n• In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continen tal Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid \ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lendi ng, that was largely funded \nby purchased money. \n• It became the seventh-largest U.S. bank a nd largest commercial lender in the United \nStates. \n• Penn Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy \nmarkets led to declining asset quality a nd earnings at Continental from 1982 into \n1984 and forced Continental to rely heav ily on foreign money markets for funding. \n• News stories in May 1984 on Continenta l’s problems started a run by foreign \ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, th ey had withdrawn more than $6 billion. \n• The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago be gan lending through the discount window to \ncover the lost deposits, and Continenta l put together a $4.5 billion loan package \nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.  \n \nII.  Interim Financial Assistance \n \n• On May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Fede ral Reserve announced an interim \nassistance package for Continental, wh ich was based on the FDIC’s open bank \nassistance authority. \n• The FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at  Continental in order to keep a liquidity \ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks , prevent significant lo sses at the many banks \nthat had correspondent accounts at Continen tal and avoid other negative effects in \nU.S. financial markets. \n• A $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest-\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FD IC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining \n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks. \n• The Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liq uidity needs of Con tinental, and a group \nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to pr ovide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an \nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed. \n• The FDIC was unable to find any merger part ners for Continental during this interim \nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s a sset problems, substa ntial litigation and \nfunding issues, along with the limited numb er of merger partners under Illinois’ \ninterstate banking restrictions.      \nIII. Permanent Financial Assistance \n \n- In July 1984, a permanent assistance pl an was put in place for Continental. \n\n31 \n - Continental’s top management and board  of directors were removed.  John \nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding \ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice  chairman of Chase Manhattan, became \nCEO of the bank. \n- The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Contin ental’s discount window borrowings from \nthe Federal Reserve. \n- In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book \nvalue) of assets from Continental.  Th is consisted of poor quality loans that \nContinental had already written  down to $3 billion (these loans were further written \ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and C ontinental was forced to take a charge of \n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continenta l for $1.5 billion, which \nContinental could repay within three year s by giving the FDIC additional loans of \nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion. \n- To offset the $1 billion charge to Continen tal’s capital that was required by the loan \nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capita l into Continental. The FDIC’s capital \ninfusion consisted of $720 million of pe rmanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior \nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9 \npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of \npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative pr eferred stock in the holding company. This \nassistance was provided through the holding co mpany rather than the bank because \ncovenants in the holding company’s debt in struments required debtholder approval to \nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it. \n- The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it fo r any losses, carrying \ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired. \n- The $2 billion in subordinated notes issu ed under the interim plan was repaid. \n- To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation \ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel,  Continental employees under incentive \ncontracts and hired specialists. \n     \nIV. Return to Private Ownership and the Co st of Resolving Continental Illinois \n \n- In a series of sales that took place be tween December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC \nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option. \n- The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their en tire investment once \nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as  compensation for loan liquidation losses.  \n- From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private \nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital \ninvestment, and it also received more than  $200 million in dividends on this stock. \n- Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from  Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion, \nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continenta l’s assets at the ti me of resolution. \n- Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.   \n\n32 \n  \nSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• Economic and financial market conditions lead ing up to the Swedish banking crisis were \nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis. \n- Deregulation of financial markets (eliminati on of quantitative controls on bank lending, \nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on cap ital flows) is similar to recent deregulation \n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial i nnovations (securitization, derivatives). \n- Large inflow of foreign capital and e xpansion of domestic  lending and debt. \n- Low/negative real interest rates. \n- Strong growth in consumption and real es tate investment and low savings rate. \n- Sharp increases in asset prices  (stocks and real estate). \n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real \ninterest rates, the impact on the economy  was similar to the current crisis.  \n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (t angible asset values fell about 30 percent). \n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankrupt cies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and \n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively). \n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from  being slightly negative at the end of the \n1980s to 8 percent in 1993. \n- Residential real estate  investment froze.  \n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan – temporary government investment in banks \nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically \nfeasible.  \n• Political support – th e program had broad political support, which was important for quick \ndecisive actions and providing the nationa l leadership necessary for public support. \n• Political independence – a Bank Support Authorit y, separate from the financial supervisory \nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the \nprogram.  The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from \npolitical interference in ma king decisions, although the BS A worked closely with the \nsupervisory authority  and central bank. \n• Debt guarantees \n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other cr editors were fully protected from future \nlosses, including foreign creditors (account ed for about 40 percent of bank funding). \n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis  ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed \ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the \ncrisis). \n• Transparency  \n- The government was very open about the process. \n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and \nrealistic asset values, and asset values that  had declined were promptly written down. \n• Bank recapitalization  \n- A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject \nto various economic scenarios.  Banks were plac ed in one of three categories based on their \nviability in the worst-case scenario, which de termined the type of government support they \nwould receive. \n- Category 1 – Capital deteriorates but re mains above minimum requirements.   \n\n33 \n The bank was expected to raise additional cap ital, with temporary government guarantees \navailable if necessary to help  maintain public confidence. \n- Category 2 – Capital falls below minimum require ments but is expected to rise above the \nminimum in a reasonable period of time. \nShareholders were expected  to contribute additional capital, with the government \ncontributing capital as necessary to meet ope rating requirements.  Government received \npreferred shares. \n- Category 3 – Capital becomes negative and ba nk is unlikely to become profitable. \nBank declared insolvent and gove rnment resolves the bank in the least-costly manner, \nincluding the possibility  of liquidation.   \n• Good bank, bad bank model – used for banks that received government support and for \ninsolvent banks.  Nonperforming loans were tran sferred to work-out companies at realistic \nmarket values.  The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound operations and managed by financial market pr ofessionals with clea r business objectives. \n• Shareholders were not protected (except fo r one bank in which the government was the \nmajority shareholder, as noted below).  \n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares. \n- The government also received vo ting power that would grow over time, so the government \nwould eventually become the majority shar eholder if the suppor t was large enough and \nmaintained for a long period of time. \n• Banks that received assistance were given c onditions to make operational improvements. \nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance. \n• Results \n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Categ ory 2) received govern ment capital (the \ngovernment was already the majority sharehol der and it also purcha sed the outstanding \nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and \neventually merged with Nordbanken; a nd Sparbanken received a government loan. \n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely \nintact – there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.  \n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent \nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke ev en, which is based on \ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale \nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proc eeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross \nfiscal cost of the support program is estimat ed to have been about 4 percent of GDP.  \n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized a nd is now part of Nordea (the government \nowns about 20 percent), which operates in  Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. \n• Lessons learned \n- Political consensus on a s upport plan is crucial. \n- Once the plan is formed and implemented, it is  just as important for the process to be \nindependent of political interference and fully tr ansparent to the public. \n- The government officials in charge of the pr ogram must take timely and decisive actions \nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political indepe ndence is important. \n- Assets must be given realistic valuations. \n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose thei r investment, and senior management and the \nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes.  Markets will \nnot be efficient unless those w ho may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs \n\n34 \n when those actions lead to losses, and equita ble treatment requires that the same rules \napply to all firms regardless of size. \n- The program’s success also requires that th e new management of the good and bad banks \nare financial industry professionals, are gi ven sound business obj ectives and clearly \nunderstand to whom they are responsible,  which is another reason why political \nindependence is important. \n                    \n \n                   \n\n35 \n REFERENCES \n \n Davison, Lee. “Continental Illi nois and ‘Too Big to Fail,’” History of the Eighties, Lessons for \nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of th e 1980s and Early 1990s , Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n       \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Co mmunity Affairs Research Conference \nWashington, DC \nApril 17, 2009 \n \n \n   \n  \n\n2 \n   \n \nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Ka nsas City, along with our  planning partners at \nthe Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Sa n Francisco, and the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors, I would like to welcome you to the second day of this conference and thank you for \nyour participation.  \nAlthough the topics to be disc ussed here are always of extreme importance, the current \nenvironment gives our discussion added urgency. Though we are all being affected by the turmoil \nin our economy, the underserved are especially vu lnerable. Their safety net may be extremely \nlimited, if it exists at all. M eanwhile, they are often the firs t to suffer during an economic \ndownturn and the last  to recover.  \nAs you all know, there are many reasons why it is  important that consumers have access to \nfinancial products and the knowledge to use them  safely. In addition to what it does for the \nindividual or family, it is also important for the nation’s collective well-being that consumers at all \nlevels are able to make wise decisions with their finances in a manner that best suits their needs.  \nWith this in mind, the regional Federal Re serve Banks have taken a number of steps \nfocused on these issues within the communities they  serve. It is well-known that the 12 Reserve \nBanks, along with their branches, play an importa nt role in giving the Federal Reserve a truly \nnational perspective on issues related to mone tary policy and banking. But they also conduct \nimportant research to help the Federal Reserve and others understand th e underlying issues for \nthose with low incomes and those who are unders erved in the area of financial services. In \nDecember of 2007, the Fed convened staff from its research, supervision and community affairs \nareas to identify the state of know ledge concerning mortgage market s in the current environment. \nThis effort identified knowledge gaps to be addr essed through research and outlined strategies to \nhelp individuals and communities respond to the financial crisis.  \n\n3 \n  We have integrated the research with public  programs where our re gional Reserve Banks \nare taking on an increasingly prominent role. Where once our public programs were focused \nprimarily on providing information to broad groups  of constituencies, we are now engaged largely \nin technical and capacity building ef forts with defined stakeholders. \nThroughout the System, each Bank has developed unique programs to meet the identified \nneeds within its District, and by doing so  has strengthened the learning, innovation and \neffectiveness of the System’s overall response. Th is is one of the real strengths of our System. \nBecause the Reserve Banks are regional institutions , we are able to foster local partnerships and \noffer local expertise to the commun ities of our respective Districts.  \nAlthough these programs are create d at the individual Bank level to serve a local need, in \nalmost all instances they provide a template th at can be, and often is, replicated by the other \nBanks, expanding the reach and succ ess rate of our best and most  beneficial programs. These \nefforts allow us to be more nimble and proactive in responding to common problems. \nWith my remaining time I would like to hi ghlight and recognize some of our more \ninnovative responses to the financial crisis. \n \nForeclosure mitigation/housing \nUnderstandably, our programs related to foreclosures and foreclosure mitigation have \nexpanded significantly and are our primary focu s.  In 2008, the Community Affairs functions \nacross the System sponsored three times as many ev ents related to foreclosure as a year earlier. \nWe have brought together diverse groups such as  developers, realtors, lenders and servicers to \nfoster a common understanding and common approach es. We have made numerous presentations \nto public officials and polic ymakers at all levels.  \nSeveral Federal Reserve Banks have work ed with alliances, including HOPE NOW \nAlliance  and NeighborWorks America, to present for eclosure prevention workshops that bring \n\n4 \n  together borrowers, counselors and servicers to di rectly identify and addre ss individual consumer \nproblems. Without a doubt, the most notable of these events was coordinated by the Boston Fed \nand held at Gillette Stadium, th e home of the New England Patriots. That event, which involved \nnumerous partners including the Patriots ’ charitable foundation, br ought more than 2,000 \nhomeowners facing foreclosure t ogether with mortgage servicer s. In Kansas City, where the \nimpact of the crisis has been slightly different, a similar event where organizers expected to help \n350 troubled borrowers ended up providing assist ance to more than twice that number.  \nAs we have seen a rise in fo reclosure-related scams, the Fed has been active, working with \nNeighborWorks America on a public service campai gn to raise awareness about the issue. We \nhave also created an innovative series of ads de veloped by the Board of Governors that will be \nshown in movie theaters, much like motion-picture trailers, in targeted communities where we are \nfinding the problem is prevalent. \nWe have established Web-based Foreclosure Resource Centers on each of the 12 Federal \nReserve Banks’ websites to help address local and regional challenges in  mortgage markets and \nlocal communities. The Foreclosure Resource Ce nters are customized by each Bank, based on the \nregion-specific conditions. The Board's public site  includes a map linking to  each of the regional \nforeclosure centers. For homeowne rs and homebuyers, the centers pr ovide contact information for \nagencies that can help those in financial trouble or provide counsel  for those who want to buy their \nfirst home. For community leaders and local m unicipalities, the centers offer information on \npreserving and protecting the neighborhoods where foreclosures have occurred. The centers also \nprovide access to Federal Reserve res earch and notices of upcoming events. \nThe Fed has published dynamic maps showing conditions and density  of owner-occupied \nsubprime mortgage loans at the st ate, county and zip code level. The maps are based on data for \nowner-occupied mortgage loans that have been s ecuritized into a product that is categorized as \nsubprime, based on the grade assigned to the secur ity. State- and county-leve l maps and data with \n\n5 \n  TransUnion credit card and mortga ge delinquency rates and changes have also been added to the \nsite. The interactive maps provide a national sour ce for information on foreclosure incidence with \nthe ability to drill down further into  conditions at the regional level.  \nOur Community Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit assists community organizations and local \ngovernments in addressing the current turmoil in the housing market and minimizing the impact of \nforeclosures on neighborhoods.  The resources in the Community Foreclos ure Mitigation Toolkit \nare presented as a four-step process to: 1) asse ss the foreclosure situati on; 2) reach troubled \nhomeowners; 3) establish post-foreclosure s upport systems; and 4) stabilize neighborhoods. \nCommunity Affairs offices worked to devel op best practices for creating, packaging and \ndistributing foreclosure crisis tool kits for smaller municipalities. \nThe Federal Reserve convened the Recovery/R enewal/Rebuilding series of conferences \nand seminars throughout the summer and fall of 2008. Events hosted by the Federal Reserve \nBanks of Atlanta, San Francisco, Cleveland and St . Louis were designed both to investigate ways \nto address the negative spillover effects of foreclosures and to help the Federal Reserve gather \ninsights on the many complex factors around forecl osure issues. After the series, a “capstone” \nevent held at the Board of Governors explored a range of policy topics and focused on emerging \nthemes. \nThese forums provided greater focus on the imp act of the foreclosure crisis on different \nreal estate markets; on strategies that address both  the negative impact of foreclosures in high-cost \nmarkets and the challenge of strengthening neig hborhoods in weak market communities; and on \nhow recent research on foreclosure and vacancy and abandonment might be actualized as public \npolicy. The series also clarified the challenges and the strategies for moving toward solutions. \n  \n\n6 \n   \nOther efforts \nThe area of financial education has been a longtime area of emphasis for the Federal \nReserve. We know there is a connection between  making wise financia l choices and problems \nsuch as foreclosure and other quality-of-life issues including the ability to gain additional \neducation or retire. \nAt the Kansas City Fed, we have looked closel y at the issue of fina ncial education in the \nworkplace. Not only is this an innovative way to potentially reach individuals who might \notherwise go without assistance, there may also be benefits for the employer in addition to the \nemployee. \nMeanwhile, the Chicago Fed pioneered an i nnovative approach to cooperatively promoting \nfinancial education services thr ough its Money Smart Week initiativ e. While this originated prior \nto the current crisis, it has provided an important  tool in highlighting resources available for \nconsumers to use in these difficult times. The Kans as City Fed has taken this model on as a tool \nfor strengthening and expanding access to financia l education services with similar programs \nthroughout our District. \nAlthough education is an importa nt component, we also know th at the complexities of our \nfinancial system can create questions for consumer s who make even the wisest financial choices. \nAlthough the system has served the nation well , consumers can be uncertain about which \nregulatory agency can provide assistance for pa rticular difficulties they may encounter. A \npartnership between the Minneapo lis and Kansas City Feds addr esses this problem, providing a \nhotline and an online resource to help consumers with their questions about specific financial \nproducts and institutions.  \nConsumers need not know which regulator is the appropriate source for assistance, but can \nturn to FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov or the related toll-free telephone number (888-851-\n\n7 \n  1920) for a wide range of resources  and assistance that can put them  in touch with the appropriate \nregulatory authority. Call center staff members are available duri ng extended hours to talk with \nindividual consumers about specific problems and offer individualized assistance. \n \nConclusion \nThis is only a very small sampling of our Community Affairs programs. And while I am \nmost familiar with the programs involving the Ka nsas City Fed, I know I speak for all of the \nReserve Bank presidents when I say that we take much pride in the work being done by our staffs \nin this area. \nI think it is important to note that many of th ese efforts have grown from the creativity of \nour local Community Affairs staffs located throughout the nation, and many of the most \ninnovative ideas have emerged in recent months. I be lieve we can expect this trend to continue as \nwe look to fully utilize the regi onal expertise, partnerships and programs to provide national \nsolutions. \nI hope this conference is benefi cial to you. I know it is benefici al to us, the policymakers. \nThank you."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce \nTulsa, Oklahoma \nApril 9, 2009 \n \n The views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or \nrepresentatives. \n \n \n\nA Resolution Process for Financial Firms \n \n• The United States is in the middle of a seri ous financial crisis, and the economy is under \nsignificant stress. While there has been a lot of  debate about how to revive the economy and \nrestore financial stability, there is broad ag reement that the economy will not recover until \nthe financial system is stabilized a nd credit starts flowing more normally. \n \n• The recovery of the financial system depends  critically on the public  regaining trust and \nconfidence in financial institutions, particularly the largest financial in stitutions. The public’s \nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken, \nthe poor management of those risks and the resu lting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal \nfinancial market activity depends importantly  on how the problems of the largest bank and \nnonbank financial instituti ons are addressed.   \n \n• Despite the best of intentions, the policies and ac tions directed at restor ing the health of the \nfinancial system have not been c onsistent or transparent. It is  understandable that the initial \nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because  the depth and breadth of the problems were \nnot expected and there were no plans in  place for addressing the problems.   \n \n• The solution must be a clear and fair plan so  that financial firms, investors and consumers \nknow what to expect when any financial institu tion runs into problems. Specifically, the plan \nmust provide a process for how policymakers will  address the deterioration of the financial \ncondition of all financial firms,  regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become \ninsolvent.   \n \n• A resolution process is part icularly important for the largest, most complex and \ninterconnected institutions because they have be en considered by many as “too big to fail,” at \nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution proc ess that can be used for any \nfinancial firm involved in the intermediation pr ocess or payments system, but the focus is on \nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too big to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the be st solution for the economy.   \n \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework \n \n• A free market system requires that business ow ners capture the profits from their successes \nand bear the costs of their failures. Firms that me et the market test will grow, while those that \ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowe d to go out of business if they fail. The \nconsequences of failure and the resolution fram ework must be clearly stated and transparent \nso that business owners have cl ear expectations about the cons equences of their actions.   \n \n• The resolution framework must prescribe a predefined set of ru les, guided by an agreed upon \nset of principles. This is particularly important  for financial institutions, big or small, because \ntheir success depends critically  on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable, \nongoing concern.  \n \n2 \n \n\n \n• There are two key principles that the resolution process should follow. \n \n• First, the resolution process should minimi ze the cost to the overall economy.   \n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant \nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems. \n- The process should minimize the cost of reso lving an insolvency to avoid a long-term \nfiscal burden on taxpayers.  \n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and \nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.  \n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, such as the government bearing some of the \nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.   \n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly \nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.   \n- To minimize the future cost to the econom y, the resolution process must not create \nadverse incentives that are inconsistent w ith economic efficiency.  Specifically, the \nresolution process must not allow a firm’s management, shareholders and creditors to \navoid the consequences of their mistakes b ecause it reduces market discipline, creates \nadverse incentives for firms to take too much  risk, and inefficientl y directs resources and \nfinancial capital to less-productive uses. \n- The process must be transparen t and clearly stated so that  everyone understands what to \nexpect and the consequences of their actio ns. Management must know beforehand what \nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant, \nnegative effect on the firm ’s financial condition. \n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution pr ocess should be based on solid research and \ninformation about what works and what doe s not work. Policymakers can learn a lot \nabout what will and will not be  successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial \ncrises, as well as at cris es in other countries.   \n \n• The second principle is the resolu tion process must be equitable in  that it is the same for all \nfinancial firms regardless of size or location, although it is possible that the outcome will \ndiffer.  -  The resolution process must provide cons istent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers,  regardless of the institution’s size, \ncomplexity or location.   \n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the differe nce between process \nand outcome.   \n- For example, if a bank is examined and f ound to be insolvent, the bank should go through \nthe resolution process and the owners shoul d lose their investment regardless of the \nbank’s size.  The outcome may be that a rela tively small bank is resolved by another \ninstitution purchasing its assets  and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is \ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank. \n- In both cases, the banks go through the same pr ocess of being declared insolvent and the \nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.   \n3 \n \n\n- Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risk s just to grow to a size large enough to \nreceive favorable treatment, and customers may choose to go with a large bank instead of \na small bank.  \nOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution  \n \n• There are several options for resolving a faile d firm, but it is important to first define \ninsolvency. \n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its co mmon equity capital is negative – that is, the \nfirm’s outstanding liabilities owed  to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets. \n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a posi tive amount of equity capital, is not viable \nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to  meet its current payment obligations, either \nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to  pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses \nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.   \n- It is important to note that these are defi nitions of insolvency and are not subjective \nconditions, which points out that the term “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It \ndoes not matter what size a firm is – if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.  \n• The question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?   \n \n• One option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to main tain ongoing operations \nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment obligations.   - In this case, nothing is actual ly resolved, and the insolvent firm is essentially bailed out \nso that it can continue normal operations.  \n- This option may be used for a large financial firm that is consider ed “too big to fail” \nbecause of concerns that it is  systemically important, in th e sense that other resolution \nmethods would have large, negati ve spillover effects on economy.   \n- Under this option, the term “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve” because of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and \nfinancial system. \n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; curren t shareholders do not \nlose their investment, alt hough the government may impose some restrictions on the \nfirm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses. \n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of th e first principle of minimizing costs.   \n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not immediately cause further problems, it sets th e stage for significant future problems. In a \nbailout, senior management, directors and curr ent shareholders stand to reap any gains \nthat may result, which weakens market discip line and creates the moral hazard that the \nfirm will take too much risk.   \n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and \nnot for smaller firms that are not expected to  cause spillover effect s if other resolution \nmethods are used. \n \n• Alternatively, bank regulators have for years us ed a variety of options to resolve insolvent \nbanks. These options include: \n4 \n \n\n- liquidation,  \n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s asse ts and assumption of its  liabilities by another \ninstitution,  \n- or operating the bank for a short period of  time through open-bank assistance or as a \nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of \nprivate investors. \n \n• When most people think of a firm as failing, th ey generally think the firm is shut down and \nliquidated.   \n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed as a receiver and it pays off insured depositors up to the deposit insurance limit. \n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid partial amounts based on expected recoveries. \n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets  by selling them or holding on to them and \nworking them out. The proceeds from the asse ts are used to first pay remaining amounts \nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecure d creditors, and if a nything is left over, \nto shareholders.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they may have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts. \n- While liquidation strongly enforces market discipline and does not promote moral hazard, it tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and \ntherefore is the least desirable choice.   \n- This option is disruptive for individuals and business custom ers because they tend to hold \nshort-term instruments, such as deposits a nd commercial paper, for making payments or \nas a temporary way of storing their f unds. Many business customers also have \ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when the bank is liquidated. \n \n• The resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumpti on (P&A) transaction, \nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another ba nk to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and \nassume its liabilities.   \n- In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution method because the FDIC may receive a prem ium from the acquiring bank. And even if \nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assu me the liabilities, it is often less costly \nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquida te the failed bank’s \nassets. \n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy. \n- Short-term creditors and count erparties have immediate acces s to all insured deposits and \nat least a large portion of uninsured obligati ons, while borrowers continue to have access \nto credit.   \n- In addition, because management and directors are replaced and shareholders lose their \ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not re duce market discipline or create adverse \nincentives for bank management and shareholders. \n   \n• While a P&A transaction is often the best optio n for most failed banks, it generally is not the \nbest option if one of the largest financial inst itutions fails because it creates even larger \ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.   \n5 \n \n\n- A major difficulty in the current financial crisis has been that some institutions are so \nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no \nmatter what option is used.   \n- Only another institution in the same size range  would have the capacity and resources to \npurchase the assets and assume the liabil ities of another large institution.   \n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been several examples of large institutions taking over other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if in stitutions can get “too \nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, th e resolution process should not result in even \nlarger institutions.  \n• The final option, which is the most feasible fo r a large, complex financial institution that \nfails, is to run it temporarily as a cons ervatorship or bri dge organization.   \n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy. \n- This option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to conduct the necessary due diligence. \n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible. \n- As will be discussed below, management, shar eholders and creditors would be forced to \nbear the full cost of their actions and positio ns they have taken to maintain market \ndiscipline and economic efficiency.   \n \n• One of the difficulties with all of these options  is that while there are time-tested, fast \nresolution processes in place for depository inst itutions, today’s largest financial institutions \nare conglomerate financial holdi ng companies with many financia l subsidiaries that are not \nbanks.   \n- The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option \nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bankruptcy process.   \n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete – sometimes years – which \nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it  can continue normal operations while in \nbankruptcy.   \n- It does not work for financial firms, however , because they have a variety of complex, \nshort-term liabilities and counterparty a rrangements that customers depend on for \nmaintaining daily operations.  A long, draw n-out bankruptcy pro ceeding would prevent \ncustomers and counterparties from having access to their funds, which would cause significant economic disruptions. \n- In addition, the cornerstone of  a financial institution’s fran chise value is trust in its \nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sure to quickly erode in a long, drawn-out bankruptcy proceeding.   \n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding comp anies quickly and in a way that minimizes \nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a \nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.   \n \n• Enacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the \nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and shoul d act immediately to \nresolve a large financial company should one fail. \n \n \n6 \n \n\n \nA Proposed Resolution Process \n \n• The resolution process discussed below is applicable  to any financial firm that is part of the \nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the \nfocus is on systemically important financial in stitutions that are f ound to be insolvent. \n \n• To prevent systemic disruptions to the econom y, a failed institution should be allowed to \ncontinue its operations through a bridge instituti on or conservatorship so that all essential \nservices and operations would go on as normal.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, it would need  additional capital to continue operating.   \n- To recapitalize the firm, the government c ould provide the capital in exchange for \npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.   \n \n• In general, the supervisory authorities would not  have the authority to declare the institution \ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management a nd shareholders bear the costs of their actions \nand investment decisions, the government’s investment would be conditional on: \n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure. \n- Existing shareholders providing the governme nt warrants to purchase all outstanding \nshares, with the amount exercised determined  by the net costs of resolving the firm. \n- While shareholders may be reluctant to agree to these conditions, in most cases, they would have little choice give n the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance. \n \n• The specific steps to be taken would depend on seve ral factors, such as the type of financial \norganization and the supervisor’s  existing legal authority.   \n- For example, if a holding company’s primar y asset is an insured bank and the bank and \nholding company become insolvent, the bank co uld be closed and the FDIC could set up \na bridge bank.   \n- In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervis ory authorities could \ntake actions to mitigate the imp act on the rest of the economy.  \n \n• The most difficult part of reso lving these large firms without a new resolution process is how \nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.   \n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing oblig ations would be addressed and dealt with \naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.   \n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would \nhave immediate access to matu ring funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on \nexpected recoveries, any collateral pr otection and likely market impact.   \n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulator y authorities to declare a nonbank financial \nfirm insolvent. \n \n• Regardless of how the firm is re solved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors \nwill be treated. \n7 \n \n\n- Short-term liabilities in partic ular would need to be addressed immediately because of \ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’  daily payment obligations and operations \nneeds.   \n- Quick decisions also need to be made on all counterparty arrangements because of the \nwidespread impact that uncerta inty about their status or default would have on their \ncounterparties.   \n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of  their decisions and market discipline is \nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in \nline behind more senior cred itors as the claims on the bank are resolved.   \n- However, the authorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, \nwhether the losses associated w ith this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in \nfinancial markets and serious funding problems th at would threaten th e viability of other \nfinancial firms.  \n \n• In a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short-\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prev ent a systemic disruption to the \neconomy.   \n- However, this guarantee should be considered as a “systemic” exception to the normal process.   \n- To limit the use of this exception to truly sy stemic situations, C ongress should enact an \napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991 \nFDIC Improvement Act.   \n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds \nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Tr easury, in consultation w ith the president.  \n- In addition, though the extension of government  guarantees and the re sulting reduction in \nmarket discipline should generally be avoided, extension of the same guarantees would need to be made to every other institution. Otherwise, failed instit utions would have a \ncompetitive advantage over sound institutions, which clearly violates the principle of \nequitable treatment.   \n \n• Another key part of the resoluti on is the bad assets need to be  taken off the balance sheet of \nthe failed institution at realistic market values.   \n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting in two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”   \n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the r eceiver could take the bad assets and work \nthem out.   \n- After writing off the bad assets, the gove rnment would provide the good bank with \nenough capital so that it can become a pr ofitable ongoing concern and attractive to \nprivate investors for even tual reprivatization.   \n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would firs t go toward paying off the costs of the \ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \n \n• The separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forwar d-looking process for recovery \nand the eventual reprivat ization of the good bank.   \n8 \n \n\n- When a bank has a large share of nonperforming  assets, they remain a burden when they \nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.   \n- For example, they still have to be funded even though they are not producing income, \nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s fi nancial condition, and they divert a lot of \nmanagement’s attention from more productiv e activities for the future growth and \nprofitability of the bank.   \n- In addition, the business objectiv es and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and \nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills for running an ongoing financial firm.   \n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand \noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is to get rid of customers and wind down the operations.      \n \n• As part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory author ities should consider breaking up \nor selling off operations and indepe ndent subsidiaries where possible. \n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market \ndiscipline problems.   \n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication th at it is too large and \ncomplex to manage well.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \n \n• A variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest fina ncial firms fail. These \nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However, \nthe resolution process being advocated he re has a record of success elsewhere.  \n \n• First, the proposed resolution pr ocess is exactly what the Swed es did to solve an equally \nsevere banking crisis that they had in the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to \n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed descri ption of the Swedish crisis and resolution \nprocess).   \n- The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was \ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.   \n- Sweden took decisive steps to identify lo sses in its major financial institutions.   \n- The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and \npublic authorities quickly t ook over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad \nassets to be managed within  a separate entity.    \n- Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its financial system, and although it \ntook several years to work down and sell off a ll of the bad assets, th ere was essentially no \nnet cost to the taxpayers.   \n- Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were \nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors \nand other unsecured creditors.   \n • Some people do not think that the Swedish situ ation is a valid comparison because it dealt \nwith only six banks.  In addition, some argue  that the Swedish system was much less \ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans, \n9 \n \n\nnot the complex financial assets, such as stru ctured securities and derivatives, that would \nhave to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail.  While these \nconcerns are valid, it shou ld be noted that:   \n- Although the United States has several thous and banks, only 19 banks have more than \n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is \nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.   \n- It is actually very difficult to work out pr oblems on real estate assets, and it is not \nnecessarily more difficult to work  out even complex securities.  \n \n• As an aside, an additional lesson that can be le arned from Sweden is th at a resolution process \nis much more likely to succeed if it has broa d political support and is structured to be \nindependent of the political process.   \n- The plan should be put largely under the control of independent supervisory agencies. \n- Political involvement should be confined la rgely to specifying the program’s goals and \nbasic rules.   \n- The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the \nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces  the need for political involvement. \n \n• A second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstruction Finance Corporation \n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems  in the United States in the 1930s.   \n- The RFC began by examining problem banks and writing down the bad assets to realistic economic values. \n- It then made any needed and appropriate  changes in bank management and provided \npublic equity capital as needed. \n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its \ncosts.  \n• A final example is the failure of Continenta l Illinois National Bank a nd its holding company \nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution \nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed pr ocess.  In addition, it is an \nexample of a resolution of  a large, complex, interconnected holding company. \n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial and industrial lender and the \nseventh- largest U.S. bank.  It had 57 offi ces in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a \nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent re lationships, and a separate \nfunction for making residential and commercial real estate loans.  It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.   \n- The attached document, “Assistance for Con tinental Illinois,” provides details about the \nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company. \n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the \nholding company shareholders lo st their entire investment, and the bank was restored to \nsound condition and returned  to private ownership. \n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns about the systemic consequences of impos ing losses on uninsured depositors and other \nunsecured creditors.    \n10 \n \n\n• Another concern that has been ra ised about letting the largest fi nancial firms fail is that it \nnationalizes these institutions.  As  part of this concern, it is  also often pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \n- In the proposed process, no firm  would be nationalized.   \n- Nationalization is the proce ss of the government taking ove r a going concern with the \nintent of continued ownership.   \n- Though a bridge institution is the most likely ou tcome for a large financial firm that fails, \nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized  as quickly as possible, subject to the \ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.   \n- In addition, subject to regulatory agency overs ight, the bridge firm would be managed by \nprivate sector managers selected for th eir experience in operating well-run, large, \ncomplex organizations.    \n \n• Some opponents to the proposed process also claim it would be very difficult to take over \nthese firms and bring in new management becau se they are too complex to manage, as well \nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, a nd skills to fill the \nopen positions.   \n- The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with \nexperience running large, complex organizations.   \n- In addition, while the institution might be co mplex, a new management team is clearly \nbetter than leaving the institution under the c ontrol of the management team that caused it \nto fail in the first place.   \n- More generally, it is hard to believe that th ere is not enough talent, either from the United \nStates or other countries, to run these organizations. \n                      \n11 \n \n\nAssistance for Continental Illinois \n \nI. Problems at Continental Illinois \n \n• In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continen tal Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid \ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lendi ng, that was largely funded \nby purchased money. \n• It became the seventh-largest U.S. bank a nd largest commercial lender in the United \nStates. \n• Penn Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy \nmarkets led to declining asset quality a nd earnings at Continental from 1982 into \n1984 and forced Continental to rely heav ily on foreign money markets for funding. \n• News stories in May 1984 on Continenta l’s problems started a run by foreign \ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, th ey had withdrawn more than $6 billion. \n• The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago be gan lending through the discount window to \ncover the lost deposits, and Continenta l put together a $4.5 billion loan package \nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.  \n \nII.  Interim Financial Assistance \n \n• On May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Fede ral Reserve announced an interim \nassistance package for Continental, wh ich was based on the FDIC’s open bank \nassistance authority. \n• The FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at  Continental in order to keep a liquidity \ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks , prevent significant lo sses at the many banks \nthat had correspondent accounts at Continen tal and avoid other negative effects in \nU.S. financial markets. \n• A $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest-\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FD IC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining \n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks. \n• The Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liq uidity needs of Con tinental, and a group \nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to pr ovide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an \nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed. \n• The FDIC was unable to find any merger part ners for Continental during this interim \nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s a sset problems, substa ntial litigation and \nfunding issues, along with the limited numb er of merger partners under Illinois’ \ninterstate banking restrictions. \n     \nIII. Permanent Financial Assistance \n \n• In July 1984, a permanent assistance pl an was put in place for Continental. \n12 \n \n\n• Continental’s top management and board  of directors were removed.  John \nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding \ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice  chairman of Chase Manhattan, became \nCEO of the bank. \n• The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Contin ental’s discount window borrowings from \nthe Federal Reserve. \n• In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book \nvalue) of assets from Continental.  This consisted of poor quality loans that \nContinental had already written  down to $3 billion (these loans were further written \ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and C ontinental was forced to take a charge of \n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continenta l for $1.5 billion, which \nContinental could repay within three year s by giving the FDIC additional loans of \nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion. \n• To offset the $1 billion charge to Continen tal’s capital that was required by the loan \nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capita l into Continental. The FDIC’s capital \ninfusion consisted of $720 million of permanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior \nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9 \npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of \npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative pr eferred stock in the holding company. This \nassistance was provided through the holding co mpany rather than the bank because \ncovenants in the holding company’s debt in struments required debtholder approval to \nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it. \n• The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it for any losses, carrying \ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired. \n• The $2 billion in subordinated notes issu ed under the interim plan was repaid. \n• To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation \ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel,  Continental employees under incentive \ncontracts and hired specialists. \n     \nIV. Return to Private Ownership and the Cost of Resolving Continental Illinois \n \n• In a series of sales that took place be tween December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC \nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option. \n• The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their en tire investment once \nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as  compensation for loan liquidation losses.  \n• From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private \nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital \ninvestment, and it also received more than  $200 million in dividends on this stock. \n• Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from  Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion, \nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continenta l’s assets at the ti me of resolution. \n13 \n \n\n• Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n14 \n \n\nSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• Economic and financial market conditions lead ing up to the Swedish banking crisis were \nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis. \n- Deregulation of financial markets (eliminati on of quantitative controls on bank lending, \nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on cap ital flows) is similar to recent deregulation \n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial i nnovations (securitization, derivatives). \n- Large inflow of foreign capital and e xpansion of domestic  lending and debt. \n- Low/negative real interest rates. \n- Strong growth in consumption and real es tate investment and low savings rate. \n- Sharp increases in asset prices  (stocks and real estate). \n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real \ninterest rates, the impact on the economy  was similar to the current crisis.  \n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (t angible asset values fell about 30 percent). \n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankrupt cies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and \n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively). \n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from  being slightly negative at the end of the \n1980s to 8 percent in 1993. \n- Residential real estate investment froze.  \n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan – temporary government investment in banks \nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically feasible.  \n• Political support – th e program had broad political support, which was important for quick \ndecisive actions and providing the national leadership necessary for public support. \n• Political independence – a Bank Support Authorit y, separate from the financial supervisory \nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the \nprogram.  The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from political interference in ma king decisions, although the BSA worked closely with the \nsupervisory authority  and central bank. \n• Debt guarantees \n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other cr editors were fully protected from future \nlosses, including foreign creditors (account ed for about 40 percent of bank funding). \n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis  ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed \ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the \ncrisis). \n• Transparency  - The government was very open about the process. \n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and \nrealistic asset values, and asset values that  had declined were promptly written down. \n• Bank recapitalization  - A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject \nto various economic scenarios.  Banks were placed in one of three categories based on their \nviability in the worst-case scenario, which de termined the type of government support they \nwould receive. \n- Category 1 – Capital deteriorates but re mains above minimum requirements.   \n15 \n \n\nThe bank was expected to raise additional cap ital, with temporary government guarantees \navailable if necessary to help  maintain public confidence. \n- Category 2 – Capital falls below minimum require ments but is expected to rise above the \nminimum in a reasonable period of time. \nShareholders were expected  to contribute additional capital, with the government \ncontributing capital as necessary to meet operating requirements.  Government received \npreferred shares. \n- Category 3 – Capital becomes negative and ba nk is unlikely to become profitable. \nBank declared insolvent and gove rnment resolves the bank in the least-costly manner, \nincluding the possibility  of liquidation.   \n• Good bank, bad bank model – used for banks that received government support and for \ninsolvent banks.  Nonperforming loans were tran sferred to work-out companies at realistic \nmarket values.  The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound operations and managed by financial market professionals with clea r business objectives. \n• Shareholders were not protected (except for one bank in which the government was the \nmajority shareholder, as noted below).  \n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares. \n- The government also received vo ting power that would grow over time, so the government \nwould eventually become the majority shar eholder if the suppor t was large enough and \nmaintained for a long period of time. \n• Banks that received assistance were given c onditions to make operational improvements. \nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance. \n• Results \n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Categ ory 2) received govern ment capital (the \ngovernment was already the majority sharehol der and it also purcha sed the outstanding \nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and \neventually merged with Nordbanken; a nd Sparbanken received a government loan. \n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely \nintact – there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.  \n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent \nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke ev en, which is based on \ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale \nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proceeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross \nfiscal cost of the support program is estimat ed to have been about 4 percent of GDP.  \n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized a nd is now part of Nordea (the government \nowns about 20 percent), which operates in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. \n• Lessons learned \n- Political consensus on a s upport plan is crucial. \n- Once the plan is formed and implemented, it is  just as important for the process to be \nindependent of political interference and fully transparent to the public. \n- The government officials in charge of the pr ogram must take timely and decisive actions \nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political indepe ndence is important. \n- Assets must be given realistic valuations. \n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose thei r investment, and senior management and the \nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes.  Markets will \nnot be efficient unless those w ho may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs \n16 \n \n\n- The program’s success also requires that th e new management of the good and bad banks \nare financial industry professionals, are gi ven sound business obj ectives and clearly \nunderstand to whom they are responsible,  which is another reason why political \nindependence is important. \n \n                   \n \n                   \n17 \n \n\n18 \n REFERENCES \n \n Davison, Lee. “Continental Illi nois and ‘Too Big to Fail,’” History of the Eighties, Lessons for \nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of th e 1980s and Early 1990s , Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.

While there has been a lot of  debate about how to revive the economy and \nrestore financial stability, there is broad ag reement that the economy will not recover until \nthe financial system is stabilized a nd credit starts flowing more normally. \n \n• The recovery of the financial system depends  critically on the public  regaining trust and \nconfidence in financial institutions, particularly the largest financial in stitutions. The public’s \nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken, \nthe poor management of those risks and the resu lting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal \nfinancial market activity depends importantly  on how the problems of the largest bank and \nnonbank financial instituti ons are addressed.   \n \n• Despite the best of intentions, the policies and ac tions directed at restor ing the health of the \nfinancial system have not been c onsistent or transparent. It is  understandable that the initial \nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because  the depth and breadth of the problems were \nnot expected and there were no plans in  place for addressing the problems.   \n \n• The solution must be a clear and fair plan so  that financial firms, investors and consumers \nknow what to expect when any financial institu tion runs into problems. Specifically, the plan \nmust provide a process for how policymakers will  address the deterioration of the financial \ncondition of all financial firms,  regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become \ninsolvent.    \n• A resolution process is part icularly important for the largest, most complex and \ninterconnected institutions because they have be en considered by many as “too big to fail,” at \nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution proc ess that can be used for any \nfinancial firm involved in the intermediation pr ocess or payments system, but the focus is on \nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too big to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the be st solution for the economy.   \n \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework \n \n• A free market system requires that business ow ners capture the profits from their successes \nand bear the costs of their failures. Firms that me et the market test will grow, while those that \ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowe d to go out of business if they fail. The \nconsequences of failure and the resolution fram ework must be clearly stated and transparent \nso that business owners have cl ear expectations about the cons equences of their actions.   \n \n• The resolution framework must pr escribe a predefined set of ru les, guided by an agreed upon \nset of principles. This is particularly important  for financial institutions, big or small, because \ntheir success depends critically  on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable, \nongoing concern.   \n\n3 \n  \n• There are two key principles that the resolution process should follow. \n \n• First, the resolution process should minimi ze the cost to the overall economy.   \n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant \nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems. \n- The process should minimize the cost of reso lving an insolvency to avoid a long-term \nfiscal burden on taxpayers.  \n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and \nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.  \n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, su ch as the government bearing some of the \nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.   \n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly \nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.   \n- To minimize the future cost to the econom y, the resolution process must not create \nadverse incentives that are inconsistent with economic efficiency.  Specifically, the \nresolution process must not allow a firm’s management, shareholders and creditors to \navoid the consequences of their mistakes b ecause it reduces market discipline, creates \nadverse incentives for firms to take too much  risk, and inefficientl y directs resources and \nfinancial capital to less-productive uses. \n- The process must be transparen t and clearly stated so that  everyone understands what to \nexpect and the consequences of their actio ns. Management must know beforehand what \nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant, \nnegative effect on the firm ’s financial condition. \n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution pr ocess should be based on solid research and \ninformation about what works and what doe s not work. Policymakers can learn a lot \nabout what will and will not be  successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial \ncrises, as well as at cris es in other countries.   \n \n• The second principle is the resolu tion process must be equitable in  that it is the same for all \nfinancial firms regardless of size or locati on, although it is possible that the outcome will \ndiffer.  -  The resolution process must provide cons istent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers,  regardless of the institution’s size, \ncomplexity or location.   \n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the differe nce between process \nand outcome.   \n- For example, if a bank is examined and f ound to be insolvent, the bank should go through \nthe resolution process and the owners shoul d lose their investment regardless of the \nbank’s size.  The outcome may be that a rela tively small bank is resolved by another \ninstitution purchasing its assets  and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is \ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank. \n- In both cases, the banks go through the same pr ocess of being declared insolvent and the \nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.   \n\n4 \n - Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risk s just to grow to a size large enough to \nreceive favorable treatment, and customers ma y choose to go with a large bank instead of \na small bank.  \nOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution  \n \n• There are several options for resolving a faile d firm, but it is important to first define \ninsolvency. \n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its co mmon equity capital is negative – that is, the \nfirm’s outstanding liabilities owed  to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets. \n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a posi tive amount of equity capital, is not viable \nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to  meet its current payment obligations, either \nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to  pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses \nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.   \n- It is important to note that these are defi nitions of insolvency and are not subjective \nconditions, which points out that the term “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It \ndoes not matter what size a firm is – if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.  \n• The question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?   \n \n• One option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to main tain ongoing operations \nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment \nobligations.   - In this case, nothing is actual ly resolved, and the insolvent firm is essentially bailed out \nso that it can continue normal operations.  \n- This option may be used for a large financial firm that is consider ed “too big to fail” \nbecause of concerns that it is  systemically important, in th e sense that other resolution \nmethods would have large, negati ve spillover effects on economy.   \n- Under this option, the term “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve” \nbecause of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and \nfinancial system. \n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; curren t shareholders do not \nlose their investment, alt hough the government may impose some restrictions on the \nfirm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses. \n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of th e first principle of minimizing costs.   \n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not \nimmediately cause further problems, it sets th e stage for significant future problems. In a \nbailout, senior management, directors and curr ent shareholders stand to reap any gains \nthat may result, which weakens market discip line and creates the moral hazard that the \nfirm will take too much risk.   \n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and \nnot for smaller firms that are not expected to  cause spillover effect s if other resolution \nmethods are used. \n \n• Alternatively, bank regulators have for years us ed a variety of options to resolve insolvent \nbanks. These options include: \n\n5 \n - liquidation,  \n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s asse ts and assumption of its  liabilities by another \ninstitution,  \n- or operating the bank for a short period of  time through open-bank assistance or as a \nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of \nprivate investors. \n \n• When most people think of a firm as failing, th ey generally think the firm is shut down and \nliquidated.   \n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed  as a receiver and it pays off insured \ndepositors up to the deposit insurance limit. \n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid pa rtial amounts based on expected recoveries. \n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets  by selling them or holding on to them and \nworking them out. The proceeds from the asse ts are used to first pay remaining amounts \nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecure d creditors, and if a nything is left over, \nto shareholders.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they \nmay have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts. \n- While liquidation strongly enforces market discipline and does not promote moral hazard, \nit tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and \ntherefore is the least desirable choice.   \n- This option is disruptive for individuals and business custom ers because they tend to hold \nshort-term instruments, such as deposits a nd commercial paper, for making payments or \nas a temporary way of storing their f unds. Many business customers also have \ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when \nthe bank is liquidated. \n \n• The resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumpti on (P&A) transaction, \nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another ba nk to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and \nassume its liabilities.   - In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution \nmethod because the FDIC may receive a prem ium from the acquiring bank. And even if \nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assu me the liabilities, it is often less costly \nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquida te the failed bank’s \nassets. \n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy. \n- Short-term creditors and count erparties have immediate acces s to all insured deposits and \nat least a large portion of uninsured obligati ons, while borrowers continue to have access \nto credit.   \n- In addition, because management and director s are replaced and shareholders lose their \ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not re duce market discipline or create adverse \nincentives for bank management and shareholders.    \n• While a P&A transaction is often the best optio n for most failed banks, it generally is not the \nbest option if one of the largest financial inst itutions fails because it creates even larger \ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.   \n\n6 \n - A major difficulty in the current financial cr isis has been that some institutions are so \nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no \nmatter what option is used.   \n- Only another institution in the same size range  would have the capacity and resources to \npurchase the assets and assume the liabil ities of another large institution.   \n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been se veral examples of large institutions taking \nover other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if in stitutions can get “too \nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, th e resolution process shoul d not result in even \nlarger institutions.  \n• The final option, which is the most feasible fo r a large, complex financial institution that \nfails, is to run it temporarily as a cons ervatorship or bri dge organization.   \n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy. \n- This option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to \nconduct the necessary due diligence. \n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible. \n- As will be discussed below, management, shar eholders and creditors would be forced to \nbear the full cost of their actions and positio ns they have taken to maintain market \ndiscipline and economic efficiency.   \n \n• One of the difficulties with all of these options  is that while there are time-tested, fast \nresolution processes in place for depository inst itutions, today’s largest financial institutions \nare conglomerate financial holdi ng companies with many financia l subsidiaries that are not \nbanks.   - The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option \nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bank ruptcy process.   \n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete – sometimes years – which \nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it  can continue normal operations while in \nbankruptcy.   \n- It does not work for financial firms, however , because they have a variety of complex, \nshort-term liabilities and counterparty a rrangements that customers depend on for \nmaintaining daily operations.  A long, draw n-out bankruptcy pro ceeding would prevent \ncustomers and counterparties from having access to their funds, which would cause \nsignificant economic disruptions. \n- In addition, the cornerstone of  a financial institution’s fran chise value is trust in its \nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sure to quickly erode in a long, drawn-\nout bankruptcy proceeding.   \n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding comp anies quickly and in a way that minimizes \nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a \nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.   \n \n• Enacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the \nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and shoul d act immediately to \nresolve a large financial company should one fail. \n \n \n\n7 \n  \nA Proposed Resolution Process \n \n• The resolution process discussed below is applicable  to any financial firm that is part of the \nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the \nfocus is on systemically important financial in stitutions that are f ound to be insolvent. \n \n• To prevent systemic disruptions to the econom y, a failed institution should be allowed to \ncontinue its operations through a bridge instituti on or conservatorship so  that all essential \nservices and operations would go on as normal.   - Because the firm is insolvent, it would need  additional capital to continue operating.   \n- To recapitalize the firm, the government c ould provide the capital in exchange for \npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.   \n \n• In general, the supervisory authorities would not  have the authority to declare the institution \ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management a nd shareholders bear the costs of their actions \nand investment decisions, the government ’s investment would be conditional on: \n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure. \n- Existing shareholders providing the governme nt warrants to purchase all outstanding \nshares, with the amount exercised determined  by the net costs of resolving the firm. \n- While shareholders may be reluctant to agre e to these conditions, in most cases, they \nwould have little choice give n the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance. \n \n• The specific steps to be taken would depend on seve ral factors, such as the type of financial \norganization and the supervisor’s  existing legal authority.   \n- For example, if a holding company’s primar y asset is an insured bank and the bank and \nholding company become insolvent, the bank co uld be closed and the FDIC could set up \na bridge bank.   \n- In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervis ory authorities could \ntake actions to mitigate the imp act on the rest of the economy.  \n \n• The most difficult part of reso lving these large firms without a new resolution process is how \nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.   \n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing oblig ations would be addressed and dealt with \naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.   \n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would \nhave immediate access to matu ring funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on \nexpected recoveries, any collateral pr otection and likely market impact.   \n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulator y authorities to decl are a nonbank financial \nfirm insolvent. \n \n• Regardless of how the firm is re solved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors \nwill be treated. \n\n8 \n - Short-term liabilities in partic ular would need to be addressed immediately because of \ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’  daily payment obligations and operations \nneeds.   \n- Quick decisions also need to be made on a ll counterparty arrangements because of the \nwidespread impact that uncerta inty about their status or default would have on their \ncounterparties.   \n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of  their decisions and market discipline is \nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in \nline behind more senior cred itors as the claims on the bank are resolved.   \n- However, the authorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, \nwhether the losses associated w ith this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in \nfinancial markets and serious funding problems th at would threaten th e viability of other \nfinancial firms.  \n \n• In a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short-\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prev ent a systemic disruption to the \neconomy.   - However, this guarantee should be considered  as a “systemic” exception to the normal \nprocess.   \n- To limit the use of this exception to truly sy stemic situations, C ongress should enact an \napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991 \nFDIC Improvement Act.   \n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds \nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Tr easury, in consultation w ith the president.  \n- In addition, though the extension of government  guarantees and the re sulting reduction in \nmarket discipline generally should be avoide d, consideration may need to be given to \nextending the guarantees to other institutions so that failed institutions do not have a competitive advantage over sound institutions. \n \n• Another key part of the resoluti on is the bad assets need to be  taken off the balance sheet of \nthe failed institution at realistic market values.   \n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting \nin two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”   \n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the r eceiver could take the bad assets and work \nthem out.   \n- After writing off the bad assets, the gove rnment would provide the good bank with \nenough capital so that it can become a pr ofitable ongoing concern and attractive to \nprivate investors for even tual reprivatization.   \n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would firs t go toward paying off the costs of the \ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \n \n• The separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forwar d-looking process for recovery \nand the eventual reprivat ization of the good bank.   \n- When a bank has a large share of nonperforming  assets, they remain a burden when they \nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.   \n\n9 \n - For example, they still have to be funde d even though they are not producing income, \nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s fi nancial condition, and they divert a lot of \nmanagement’s attention from more productiv e activities for the future growth and \nprofitability of the bank.   \n- In addition, the business objectiv es and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and \nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills for running an ongoing financial firm.   \n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand \noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is  to get rid of customers and wind down the \noperations.      \n \n• As part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory author ities should consider breaking up \nor selling off operations and indepe ndent subsidiaries where possible. \n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market \ndiscipline problems.   \n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication th at it is too large and \ncomplex to manage well.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \n \n• A variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest fina ncial firms fail. These \nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However, \nthe resolution process being advocated he re has a record of success elsewhere.  \n \n• First, the proposed resolution pr ocess is exactly what the Swed es did to solve an equally \nsevere banking crisis that they had in the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to \n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed descri ption of the Swedish crisis and resolution \nprocess).   \n- The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was \ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.   \n- Sweden took decisive steps to identify lo sses in its major financial institutions.   \n- The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and \npublic authorities quickly t ook over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad \nassets to be managed within  a separate entity.    \n- Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its fi nancial system, and although it \ntook several years to work down and sell off a ll of the bad assets, th ere was essentially no \nnet cost to the taxpayers.   \n- Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were \nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors \nand other unsecured creditors.   \n \n• Some people do not think that the Swedish situ ation is a valid comparison because it dealt \nwith only six banks.  In addition, some argue  that the Swedish system was much less \ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans, \nnot the complex financial assets, such as stru ctured securities and de rivatives, that would \n\n10 \n have to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail.  While these \nconcerns are valid, it shou ld be noted that:   \n- Although the United States has several thous and banks, only 19 banks have more than \n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is \nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.   \n- It is actually very difficult to work out pr oblems on real estate assets, and it is not \nnecessarily more difficult to work  out even complex securities.  \n \n• As an aside, an additional lesson that can be le arned from Sweden is th at a resolution process \nis much more likely to succeed if it has broa d political support and is structured to be \nindependent of the political process.   - The plan should be put largely under the c ontrol of independent supervisory agencies. \n- Political involvement should be confined la rgely to specifying the program’s goals and \nbasic rules.   \n- The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the \nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces  the need for political involvement. \n \n• A second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstructi on Finance Corporation \n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems  in the United States in the 1930s.   \n- The RFC began by examining problem banks a nd writing down the bad assets to realistic \neconomic values. \n- It then made any needed and appropriate  changes in bank management and provided \npublic equity capital as needed. \n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its \ncosts.  \n• A final example is the failure of Continenta l Illinois National Bank a nd its holding company \nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution \nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed pr ocess.  In addition, it is an \nexample of a resolution of  a large, complex, interconnected holding company. \n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial a nd industrial lender and the \nseventh- largest U.S. bank.  It had 57 offi ces in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a \nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent re lationships, and a separate \nfunction for making residential and commercial  real estate loans.  It also provided \nspecialized services to a variety of companies.   \n- The attached document, “Assistance for Con tinental Illinois,” provides details about the \nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company. \n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the \nholding company shareholders lo st their entire investment, and the bank was restored to \nsound condition and returned  to private ownership. \n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns \nabout the systemic consequences of impos ing losses on uninsured depositors and other \nunsecured creditors.    \n\n11 \n • Another concern that has been ra ised about letting the largest fi nancial firms fail is that it \nnationalizes these institutions.  As  part of this concern, it is  also often pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \n- In the proposed process, no firm  would be nationalized.   \n- Nationalization is the proce ss of the government taking ove r a going concern with the \nintent of continued ownership.   \n- Though a bridge institution is the most likely ou tcome for a large financial firm that fails, \nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized  as quickly as possible, subject to the \ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.   \n- In addition, subject to regulatory agency overs ight, the bridge firm would be managed by \nprivate sector managers selected for th eir experience in operating well-run, large, \ncomplex organizations.    \n \n• Some opponents to the proposed process also cl aim it would be very difficult to take over \nthese firms and bring in new management becau se they are too complex to manage, as well \nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, a nd skills to fill the \nopen positions.   - The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with \nexperience running large, complex organizations.   \n- In addition, while the institution might be co mplex, a new management team is clearly \nbetter than leaving the institution under the c ontrol of the management team that caused it \nto fail in the first place.   \n- More generally, it is hard to believe that th ere is not enough talent, either from the United \nStates or other countries, to run these organizations. \n                      \n\n12 \n Assistance for Continental Illinois \n \nI. Problems at Continental Illinois \n \n• In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continen tal Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid \ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lendi ng, that was largely funded \nby purchased money. \n• It became the seventh-largest U.S. bank a nd largest commercial lender in the United \nStates. \n• Penn Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy \nmarkets led to declining asset quality a nd earnings at Continental from 1982 into \n1984 and forced Continental to rely heav ily on foreign money markets for funding. \n• News stories in May 1984 on Continenta l’s problems started a run by foreign \ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, th ey had withdrawn more than $6 billion. \n• The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago be gan lending through the discount window to \ncover the lost deposits, and Continenta l put together a $4.5 billion loan package \nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.  \n \nII.  Interim Financial Assistance \n \n• On May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Fede ral Reserve announced an interim \nassistance package for Continental, wh ich was based on the FDIC’s open bank \nassistance authority. \n• The FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at  Continental in order to keep a liquidity \ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks , prevent significant lo sses at the many banks \nthat had correspondent accounts at Continen tal and avoid other negative effects in \nU.S. financial markets. \n• A $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest-\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FD IC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining \n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks. \n• The Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liq uidity needs of Con tinental, and a group \nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to pr ovide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an \nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed. \n• The FDIC was unable to find any merger part ners for Continental during this interim \nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s a sset problems, substa ntial litigation and \nfunding issues, along with the limited numb er of merger partners under Illinois’ \ninterstate banking restrictions. \n     \nIII. Permanent Financial Assistance \n \n• In July 1984, a permanent assistance pl an was put in place for Continental. \n\n13 \n • Continental’s top management and board  of directors were removed.  John \nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding \ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice  chairman of Chase Manhattan, became \nCEO of the bank. \n• The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Contin ental’s discount window borrowings from \nthe Federal Reserve. \n• In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book \nvalue) of assets from Continental.  Th is consisted of poor quality loans that \nContinental had already written  down to $3 billion (these loans were further written \ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and C ontinental was forced to take a charge of \n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continenta l for $1.5 billion, which \nContinental could repay within three year s by giving the FDIC additional loans of \nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion. \n• To offset the $1 billion charge to Continen tal’s capital that was required by the loan \nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capita l into Continental. The FDIC’s capital \ninfusion consisted of $720 million of pe rmanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior \nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9 \npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of \npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative pr eferred stock in the holding company. This \nassistance was provided through the holding co mpany rather than the bank because \ncovenants in the holding company’s debt in struments required debtholder approval to \nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it. \n• The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it fo r any losses, carrying \ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired. \n• The $2 billion in subordinated notes issu ed under the interim plan was repaid. \n• To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation \ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel,  Continental employees under incentive \ncontracts and hired specialists.      \nIV. Return to Private Ownership and the Co st of Resolving Continental Illinois \n \n• In a series of sales that took place be tween December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC \nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option. \n• The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their en tire investment once \nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as  compensation for loan liquidation losses.  \n• From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private \nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital \ninvestment, and it also received more than  $200 million in dividends on this stock. \n• Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from  Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion, \nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continenta l’s assets at the ti me of resolution. \n\n14 \n • Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n\n15 \n Swedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• Economic and financial market conditions lead ing up to the Swedish banking crisis were \nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis. - Deregulation of financial markets (eliminati on of quantitative controls on bank lending, \nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on cap ital flows) is similar to recent deregulation \n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial i nnovations (securitization, derivatives). \n- Large inflow of foreign capital and e xpansion of domestic  lending and debt. \n- Low/negative real interest rates. \n- Strong growth in consumption and real es tate investment and low savings rate. \n- Sharp increases in asset prices  (stocks and real estate). \n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real \ninterest rates, the impact on the economy  was similar to the current crisis.  \n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (t angible asset values fell about 30 percent). \n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankrupt cies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and \n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively). \n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from  being slightly negative at the end of the \n1980s to 8 percent in 1993. \n- Residential real estate  investment froze.  \n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan – temporary government investment in banks \nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically \nfeasible.  \n• Political support – th e program had broad political support, which was important for quick \ndecisive actions and providing the nationa l leadership necessary for public support. \n• Political independence – a Bank Support Authorit y, separate from the financial supervisory \nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the \nprogram.  The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from \npolitical interference in ma king decisions, although the BS A worked closely with the \nsupervisory authority  and central bank. \n• Debt guarantees \n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other cr editors were fully protected from future \nlosses, including foreign creditors (account ed for about 40 percent of bank funding). \n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis  ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed \ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the \ncrisis). \n• Transparency  \n- \nThe government was very open about the process. \n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and \nrealistic asset values, and asset values that  had declined were promptly written down. \n• Bank recapitalization  \n- A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject \nto various economic scenarios.  Banks were plac ed in one of three categories based on their \nviability in the worst-case scenario, which de termined the type of government support they \nwould receive. \n- Category 1 – Capital deteriorates but re mains above minimum requirements.   \n\n16 \n The bank was expected to raise additional cap ital, with temporary government guarantees \navailable if necessary to help  maintain public confidence. \n- Category 2 – Capital falls below minimum require ments but is expected to rise above the \nminimum in a reasonable period of time. \nShareholders were expected  to contribute additional capital, with the government \ncontributing capital as necessary to meet ope rating requirements.  Government received \npreferred shares. \n- Category 3 – Capital becomes negative and ba nk is unlikely to become profitable. \nBank declared insolvent and gove rnment resolves the bank in the least-costly manner, \nincluding the possibility  of liquidation.   \n• Good bank, bad bank model – used for banks that received government support and for \ninsolvent banks.  Nonperforming loans were tran sferred to work-out companies at realistic \nmarket values.  The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound operations and managed by financial market pr ofessionals with clea r business objectives. \n• Shareholders were not protected (except fo r one bank in which the government was the \nmajority shareholder, as noted below).  \n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares. \n- The government also received vo ting power that would grow over time, so the government \nwould eventually become the majority shar eholder if the suppor t was large enough and \nmaintained for a long period of time. \n• Banks that received assistance were given c onditions to make operational improvements. \nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance. \n• Results \n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Categ ory 2) received govern ment capital (the \ngovernment was already the majority sharehol der and it also purcha sed the outstanding \nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and \neventually merged with Nordbanken; a nd Sparbanken received a government loan. \n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely \nintact – there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.  \n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent \nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke ev en, which is based on \ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale \nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proc eeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross \nfiscal cost of the support program is estimat ed to have been about 4 percent of GDP.  \n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized a nd is now part of Nordea (the government \nowns about 20 percent), which operates in  Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. \n• Lessons learned \n- Political consensus on a s upport plan is crucial. \n- Once the plan is formed and implemented, it is  just as important for the process to be \nindependent of political interference and fully tr ansparent to the public. \n- The government officials in charge of the pr ogram must take timely and decisive actions \nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political indepe ndence is important. \n- Assets must be given realistic valuations. \n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose thei r investment, and senior management and the \nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes.  Markets will \nnot be efficient unless those w ho may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs \n\n17 \n when those actions lead to losses, and equita ble treatment requires that the same rules \napply to all firms regardless of size. \n- The program’s success also requires that th e new management of the good and bad banks \nare financial industry professionals, are gi ven sound business obj ectives and clearly \nunderstand to whom they are responsible,  which is another reason why political \nindependence is important. \n                    \n \n                   \n\n18 \n REFERENCES \n \n Davison, Lee. “Continental Illi nois and ‘Too Big to Fail,’” History of the Eighties, Lessons for \nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of th e 1980s and Early 1990s , Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.

Hoenig  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \nFinancial Stability Institute, Bank for International Settlements  \nHigh -Level Meeting on Recent Developments in Financial Markets and Supervisory Responses  \nLima, Peru  \nApril 2, 2009  \n \n\n2 \n I am honored to be asked to provide some opening comments for this  conference.   \n \nOver the past year, we  have all been heavily involved in  the global financial crisis . As \npolicymakers and re gulators, our mission during this turmoil is twofold. We are responding  to \nemerging events , but at the same time we are also challenged with making  the changes necessary \nto protect  the financial system from a similar crisis in the future.  \nSo, the  urgency on all sides is certainly warranted. The time it takes to resolve these \nissues only increases the cost and further delays the potential for a full global economic recovery. \nUnfortu nately , urgency often creates an environment where quick decis ions prevail over well -\nthought -out sol utions. T he focus in times such as these is often on proximate causes instead of \nunderlying problems.  The current  crisis , unfortunately,  has been no differe nt. \nThere were many events involved in this crisis , and as I react to them and consider what \nthey mean from a regulatory perspective , I would suggest three key areas  that need to change.  \nFirst, r egulation must be based on a clear set of simple, understandable and enforceable \nrules rather that a set of broad  principles open to interpretation.  \nSecond, t his has been the first real test of Basel II , and it has failed  to achieve its \nobjective . \nThird , we must produce a means for resolving  firms  that some would deem “too -big-to-\nfail.” These institutions do fail and we must allow  them to do so  in a way that controls damage to \nthe entire financial sector.  \n \nPrinciples -Based vs. Rules -Based Regulation  \nIn recent years, there have been increasing calls for the United States and many other \ncountries to shift toward  a risk -focused and principles -based approach to supervision and \n\n3 \n regulation.  Unlike a rules -based system, which might establish maximum loan -to-value ratios or \nlimit the amount an institution can lend, a principles -based system specifies desired outcomes \nand allows the regulated firms  extensive control over  how they  achieve those results .  \nAs a regulator responsible for ensuring stability, I can s um up the argument of principles \nversus rules v ery simply in my mind: P rinciples provide financial institutions with opportunities \nto debate ; rules provide supervisors with the best chance to properly  enforce  sound practices . \nThose who support a principles -based system say that with rapid growth in the financial \nmarkets, supervisors no longer have the resources to monitor compliance wit h every rule and \nregulation.  They say the principles -based approach  gives  institutions more flexibility in adapting \nto a rapidly ev olving financial environment, thereby making  a country’s financial markets more \nattractive, innovative and com petitive on a worldwide basis.  \nTo that I would respond that  a carefully crafted rules -based approach does not hamper \nfinancial innovation.  Good rulemaking incorporates public comment , thus giving institutions an \nopportunity to suggest less burdensome and more effective ways to achieve regulator y goals.  In a \nrules -based environment, superviso rs cannot  just mechanically impose the rules on regulated \nfirms, but must  rely on a good  dialog ue with the firms as an important part of the supervisory  \nprocess.  \nBecause principles must constantly be interpreted, a principles -based approach by its very \nnature fosters an environment of less clarity and reduced transparency  in the regulatory system . \nWith  issues  open to interpretation, supervisors also have less power to enforce  regulations when \nan institution  disagrees.  This problem is particularly serious  when  an economy is strong and  \nquestionable activities may appear  to be successful  in the environment of the time . The result  is \nlikely to be a gradual erosion of regulatory standards during prosper ous times and greater harm  \n\n4 \n to institutions and the  broader financial system  when th e economic cycle reverses direction . If \nthere is one thing that we have lea rned from the current crisis it is that we  must have a strong set \nof rules in place to limit any erosion in regulatory standards over the cycle.  \nMy final con cern with principles -based regulation  is that  for it to be effective, regulators \nand firms must have consistent goals  and incenti ves. There must be mutual trust. Although I \nthink we would all like for this ideal to be attainable, we know in reality that it  is extremely \ndifficult to achieve.  \n Given the events that led to our  current crisis, it strikes me that we must reemphasize \nlongstanding and  proven rules -based standards to limit excessive risk -taking.  There must be  a \nfirm framework for enforcing and achieving our supervisory objectives.  \n \nBasel II  \nMany of the same issues surrounding principles -based regulation versus a rules -based \nsystem also apply to Basel II.  The main  “principle ” underlying the Bas el II framework  is that \ncapital requirements should be closely aligned with the risk assumed by the financial institution.  \nBasel II relies on  institutions making detailed assessment s of the risks they have assume d \nso a more precise capital requirement can be assigned.  Base l II, in fact, allows banks to use credit \nratings and their own internal  risk models to measure these risks and calculate  their capital needs . \nIn this regard, Basel II would  replac e a system that was based on  broad “risk buckets ” \nand a set of “ rules ” that determined what should go in these risk buckets and what capital would \nneed to be held against these specific risk -asset measures.   \nWhether this shift to a more principles -based capital framework under Basel II is \nbeneficial will depend on a number of the points that I noted  previously.   \n\n5 \n These points include:   \n Will the flexibility provided to banks in using their own risk models  lead to better \noutcomes , or will the y create greater  supervisor y enforcement and compliance \nproblems?   \n Will it be more difficult to get banks to build up and maintain higher levels of \ncapital during more prosperous times?   \n Can supervisors ensure that all banks operating under the Basel II framework \nfollow a consistent approach  in measuring capital needs?  \nThe difficulties with using models to measure risks are well -known to all of us . They \nhave become  painfully  apparent in the current financial crisis . Consequently,  we must be \ncautious in how we set capital requirements and limit financial leverage.  Models and credit \nratings don’t anticipate shifting risks very well.  \nModels calibrated during periods of stress can overestimate  risk and reinforce  the \nprocyclical effects of capital regulation.   \nEven m ore disastrous  are c alibrations performed during good times that can cause models \nto underestimate the risks of turbulent  conditions and leave banks holding insuff icient capital . An \nexample is provided by the experience of Britain’s Northern Rock.  At the time of its collapse, \nNorthern Rock had calculated that it had  substantial surplus capital under Basel II and was close \nto receiving regulatory approval to dividend out the “extra” capital to its shareholders . \nModels can fail to measure adequately a bank’s exposure to macroeconomic shocks and \nwill not measure risks n ot previously experienced.  For example, many risk models  clearly failed \nto anticipate the downturn in housing prices that  we have seen over the last several years.  A more \nspecific  example is the counterparties to AIG’s credit default swaps , who  took steps to protect \n\n6 \n themselves from credit risk by including collateral requirements in their swap contracts.  \nHowever, the counterparties did not anticipate that AIG’s o verall  risk would exceed the amount \nof collateral it could provide. Consequently, t he counterparties’ models did not indicate that \ncapital was needed for this exposure  or that the institutions should  shift their business away from \nAIG. \nAnother important problem is that models make enforcement of capital adequacy more \ndifficult.  Examiners mu st try to understand and evaluate very complex mathematical models , and \nwhen these model s appear to understate  capital needs , examiner s will have a difficult  time \narguing the technical merits of their views and convincing  bank management  of a need to add \ncapital . In too many cases, because management’s ROE depends on reducing capital, the result \nwill be insufficient capital and excessive bank leverage.  \nBanks have strong competitive and financial incentives to increase leverage.  Leverage \nincreases profitabil ity during good times, but it necessarily increases risk.  We have seen the \nbroad systemic effects of excessive leverage in the current environment.  In many ways, t he Basle \nII model -based capital regime provide s banks with a rationale , a defense  and an oppo rtunity  for \ntaking excessive leverage.  \nOverleveraging has been a major problem during the current market meltdown – both \namong the institutions now operating under Basel II and among those that will soon come under \nthis framework.  \nTo limit such problems in  the future, we must maintain limits on financial leverage \nthrough strict rules that set a minimum capital -to-assets ratio.  This type of rule would be the \neasiest , most equitable  and clear -cut way to set capital requirements for all sizes of banks and for  \na broader range of firms throughout our financial markets.  \n\n7 \n A leverage standard would also be much harder to evade than capital standards based on \nan ins titution’s own estimates of risk exp osure.  I am particularly concerned that institutions that \nunderesti mate their risk exposures under the Basel II framework will invariably hold less capital \nthan they need and be the first to have serious problems during a crisis.  Consequently , as we \ndiscuss how we might strengthen the Basel II framework today, I believe w e should also give \nattention to how we can underpin this approach with a strict rule on the amount of leverage an \ninstitution can assume.  While leverage requirements are not a panacea for supervising financial \nfirms, it is clear that if you want  to direct your resourc es to where  you are most likely to have \nproblems, you can direct them to the more highly leveraged and weakened  firms. \n \nA Resolution Framework for Institutions Deemed “Too Big to Fail”  \nFinally , this meeting will be looking at how we should deal  with institutions that are \nsystemi cally important or what many  call “too big to fail.”  Although discussions about \nsupervisory framework and capital regulation are vitally important, the idea that some \ninstitutions can be too big to fail , and thereby recei ve special treatment, is the most immediate \nconcern and the area where the actions so far have been most troubling .  \nThere are very real and rapidly escalating costs that are being absorbed by the  U.S. \ntaxpayers.  There are also some very important question s that, in the name of “urgen t,” have been \npushed to the side rather than addressed in a systematic fashion.  In recent weeks, you have seen \noutrage in the United  States  over bonuses paid to some employees of AIG, which has received \nsubstantial government funding . We must think through carefully the consequences of well -\nintentioned  but rushed decisions.  Although the extreme costs of the bailout have received much \n\n8 \n of the attention, there are other  fundamental questions about competitive fairness, capitalism and \nfinancial market s that must be considered as well .  \nIn the interest of time, I will raise  only one  example right now . Currently, the stock prices \nof some of these “too big to fail ” financial companies are trading for a fraction  of their pre -crisis \nlevels, although  billions of government dollars in the form of capital, loans and guarantees are \nbeing pump ed into these firms  to avoid either capital or liquidity insolvency . If the government  \nstays the current course  and it works, the stock prices will rise.  For a shareholder buying in at \ncurrent levels, a return to even half of what the shares traded at a couple of years ago could \ngenerate very large return s. So, not only are taxpayers picking up the tab for making these firms \nviable, they are also taking on an inordinate amount of the  risk and leaving the rewards for \nprivate investors.  And I suspect that as the markets become more confident that the government \nwill continue its support for “too big to fail,” the price of such shares will indeed bring hands ome \nreturns.    \nWith issues like this in mind, I recently gave a speech on this topic , titled , “Too Big Has \nFailed.” I would like to take a few moments to reiterate some of the key points  concerning how \nwe might  address this issue.  \nOne comparison I drew was  between Japan and Sweden.  As you may recall, Japan took a \nvery gradual and delayed approach in the 1990s to addressing its banking problems and put off \ndealing with a critical shortage of capital in its banks.  In contrast, after a severe real estate \ncolla pse in the early 1990s, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial \ninstitutions . The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized,  largely through private sources, \nand public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks  and spun off their bad assets \nto be managed withi n a separate entity. Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its \n\n9 \n financial system at little cost to taxpayers, while Japan continued  to have a weakened banking \nsystem for much of the 1990s.  \nAnother  important example  is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was \nused to deal with banking problems in t he United States in the 1930s. The RFC proved to be \nhighly successful in using public funds to recapitalize banks with no net cost to taxpa yers. This \nsuccess was based on the RFC’s adherence to a sound set of principles, beginning with writing \ndown the bad assets at a bank to realistic economic values and making any needed and \nappropriate changes in bank management before injecting public equ ity into the bank.  \nA final example is the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank in 1984.  Although \nContinental Illinois was essentially deemed “too big to fail” and was handled through an open \nbank assistance program , it showed that U.S. banking aut horities could take over a very large \nbank, replace its management and wipe out stockholders, and then restore the bank to sound \ncondition and return it to private ownership.  \nThere are several lessons that we can draw from these past experiences.  \n First, th e losses in the financial system won’t go away – they will only fester and \nincrease while impe ding our chances for a recovery.  \n Second, we must take a consistent, timely and specific approach to major \ninstitutions and their problems if we are to reduce mark et uncertainty and bring in \nprivate investors and market funding.  \n Third, if institutions – no matter what their size – have lost market confidence and \ncan’t survive on their own, we must be willing to write down their losses, bring in \ncapable management, s ell off and reorganize misaligned activities and businesses, \nand begin the process of restoring them to private ownership.  \n\n10 \n The question that supervisors in all countries must ask themselves is:  How can we best \nresolve problems at financial institutions tha t are deemed to be “too big to fail” ? \nOne guide to how we could proceed in the United States is the process we use for failing \nbanks.  This approach – albeit far from perfect in dealing with “too big to fail ” banks – has been \ndeveloped over time in response  to previous crises and deals with many of the issues that need to \nbe resolved in today’s environment.  \nOur bank resolution process focuses on timely action to protect depositors and limit \nspillover effects to the economy and the rest of the financial syste m. For instance, insured \ndepositors at failed banks typically receive immediate access to their funds, while uninsured \ndepositors often receive quick, partial payouts based on expected recoveries or , in systemic \ncircumstances , may be fully protected.  \nAlso,  we have a variety of means for resolving failed banks and ensuring a continuity of \nessential services, including selling all or part of a failed bank to a bank in sound condition or \noperating the bank under regulatory oversight through a bridge bank, cons ervatorship  or open \nbank assistance.  These options focus on bringing in capable management, while putting the \nshareholders at failed banks f irst in line to absorb losses. The FDIC, as receiver for failed banks, \nmust pursue the least costly option – except in systemic circumstances – in order to protect the \ndeposit insurance fund and taxpayers.  \nI support constructing a similar resolution program that we could apply consistently to all \n“too big to fail” institutions, including banks, bank and financial holdin g companies, and \nnonbank financial institutions.  \nWithout going into details, I think a resolution plan for “too  big to fail” institutions \nshould be based on several princip les. \n\n11 \n First, it must be equitable and consistent when compared to how other failing financial \ninstitutions and their customers are treated.  Giving any type of institution special treatment will \nundermine confidence in the fairness of the financial system, increase moral hazard problems \nand provide incentives for taking greater risk.  \nSecon d, a plan must ensure timely action to protect customers and provide for a \ncontinuity of essential financial services, much like many countries have done in giving \ndepositors at failed banks immediate access to all or a major portion of their funds.  I woul d also \nargue for establishing a clear priority for handling claims, with shareholders and large unsecured \ncreditors having to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken.  In addition , to prevent \ndelays and political interference, I believe it is im portant to have a source of public funds that \ncan be tapped for resolutions and for this resolution authority to be put largely under the control \nof independent supervisory agencies.  \nWhile some have criticized this type of approach on the grounds that we would be \n“nationalizing” our financial system and that regulators are ill -equipped to take over and operate  \na large institution, this is not what I believe or advocat e. \nResolving problems at failing institutions is something that public authorities have done \nmany times  in the past . While it may take more time to work out the problems at larger \ninstitutions and return them to private ownership, this is still a temporary step that would be \ntaken with a limited number of institutions.  Moreover, the experience of banking agencies in \ndealing with significant failures indicates that regulators are capable of bringing in qualified \nmanagement and finding specialized expertise when needed.  \nIf we don’t take decisive steps to resolve major banking problems, I believe w e will face \na much more serious set of issues.  In fact, leaving failing institutions to continue their operations \n\n12 \n with a failed management team in place is certain to prove  more costly in the long run and less \nlikely to restore public confidence and get us  back on the path to recovery.  \nFirms that rely on significant infusions of public funds have failed . We need to stop \npropping them up and start taking them apart in an orderly manner.  \n \nConclusion  \nBefore I conclude , I would like to make one final comment. There is no doubt that the \nmonths to come will be filled with talk about sweeping regulatory changes. The actions of the \nlast several months, rather than solving the problem, seem to have added only more questions t o \nthe debate. I hope, in this instance, instead of being led down a path of “urgent” action , we \ncareful ly consider solutions. In the United States , there is talk about the need for a financial \nstability regulator and who should fill that role. I believe th at the Federal Reserve, by design, has \nthat responsibility  and must start filling that role. Instead or rewriting the rule book, I think we \nneed to first enforce what is already there and do it in a fair and evenhanded manner that is not \ninfluenced by circ umstances we decide are “special” because of the nature of the problem or the \nsize of the firm involved.  \nThe current financial crisis is providing a very comprehensive test of our financial \nsystems a nd supervisory frameworks. W e are all  clearly interested in identifying what went \nwrong, what can we do to work our way out of today’s problems, and wha t we should do going \nforward . I am certainly looking forward to this meeting and hearing everyone’s views on the \nchallenges we face."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n    \n     \nOmaha, Neb. \nMarch 6, 2009 \n \n\n \n \n2 \n Two years ago, we started seeing a problem in  a specialized area of financial markets \nthat many people had never heard of, known as th e subprime mortgage market.  At that time, \nmost policymakers thought the problems would be  self-contained and have limited impact on \nthe broader economy.  Today, we know differentl y. We are in the midst of a very serious \nfinancial crisis, and our econom y is under significant stress. \nOver the past year, the Federal government and financial policy makers have enacted \nnumerous programs and committed trillions of dolla rs of public funds to address the crisis.  \nAnd still the problems remain.  We have yet to  restore confidence and transparency to the \nfinancial markets, leaving le nders and investors wary of  making new commitments.   \nThe outcome so far, while disappoi nting, is perhaps not surprising. \nWe have been slow to face up to the funda mental problems in our financial system \nand reluctant to take decisive action with re spect to failing institutions.  We are slowly \nbeginning to deal with the overh ang of problem assets and management weaknesses in some \nof our largest firms that this cr isis is revealing.  We have been  quick to provide liquidity and \npublic capital, but we have not defined a consistent plan and not addressed basic \nshortcomings and, in some cases, the insolvent position of these institutions.  \nWe understandably would prefer not to “nat ionalize” these businesses, but in reacting \nas we are, we nevertheless are drifting into  a situation where in stitutions are being \nnationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis. \nWith conditions deteriorating around us, I will offer my views on how we might yet \ndeal with the current state of a ffairs.  I’ll start with a brief overview of the policy actions we \nhave been pursuing, but I will also provide pers pective on the actions we have taken and the \noutcomes we have experienced in previous fi nancial crises.  Finall y, I will suggest what \n\n \n \n3 \n lessons we might take from these previous cr ises and apply to working our way out of the \ncurrent crisis. \nIn suggesting alternative solutions, I acknow ledge it is no simple matter to solve. \nPeople say “it can’t be done” when speaking of allowing large institutions to fail. But I don’t \nthink that those who managed the Reconstructi on Finance Corporation, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, the Swedish financial crisis or a ny other financial crisis were handed a blueprint \nthat carried a guarantee of success.  I don’t accept that we have lo st our ability to solve a new \nproblem, especially when it looks like a familiar problem. \n \nCurrent Policy Actions and Problems \nMuch has been written about how we got in to our current situa tion, most notably the \nbreakdowns in our mortgage finance system, we ak or neglected risk management practices, \nand highly leveraged and interconnected firms and financial markets.  Because this has been \nwell-documented, today I will focus on the policy responses we have tried so far and where \nthey appear to be falling short.  \nA wide range of policy steps has been ta ken to support financial institutions and \nimprove the flow of credit to businesses and hous eholds.  In the interest of time, I will go \nover the list quickly. \nAs a means of providing liquidity to the financial system and the economy, the \nFederal Reserve has reduced the targeted federa l funds rate in a series of steps from 5.25 \npercent at mid-year 2007 to the present 0 to 25 basis-point range.  In addition, the Federal \nReserve has instituted a wide range of ne w lending programs and, through its emergency \nlending powers, has extended this lending beyond depository institutions. \n\n \n \n4 \n The Treasury Department, the Federal Rese rve and other regulators have also \narranged bailouts and mergers for large strugg ling or insolvent institutions, including Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, WaM u, Wachovia, AIG, Countrywide, and Merrill \nLynch.  But other firms, such as Lehman  Brothers, have been allowed to fail. \nThe Treasury has invested public funds, buying preferred stock in more than 400 \nfinancial institutions through the TARP program.  TARP money has also been used to fund \ngovernment guarantees of more than $400 billi on of securities held by major financial \ninstitutions, such as CitiGroup and Bank of Am erica.  In addition, the Federal Reserve and \nthe Treasury Department have committed more  than $170 billion to bail out the troubled \ninsurance company AIG.   \nOther actions have included increased deposit insurance limits and guarantees for \nbank debt instruments and m oney market mutual funds. \nThe most recent step is the Treasury financ ial stability plan, which provides for a new \nround of TARP spending and controls, assistance  for struggling homeowners, and a plan for \na government/private sector partnership to buy up bad assets held by financial institutions \nand others. \nThe sequence of these actions, unfortunate ly, has added to market uncertainty. \nInvestors are understandably watching to see which institutions will receive public money and survive as wards of the state. \nAny financial crisis leaves a stream  of losses embedded among the various \nparticipants, and these losses must ultimately be borne by someone.  To start the resolution \nprocess, management responsible for the problems  must be replaced and the losses identified \nand taken. Until these kinds of actions are taken,  there is little chance to restore market \n\n \n \n5 \n confidence and get credit  markets flowing.  It is not a que stion of avoiding these losses, but \none of how soon we will take them and get on to the process of recovery.  Economist Allan \nMeltzer may have expressed this point best when  he said that “capitalism without failure is \nlike religion without sin.”   \n \nWhat Might We Learn from Previous Financial Crises? \nMany of the policy actions I just describe d provide support to the largest financial \ninstitutions, those that are fre quently referred to as “too big to fail.” A rationale for such \nactions is that the failure of a large institution would have a systemic impact on the economy.  It is emphasized that markets have become mo re complex, and institutions – both bank and \nnonbank entities – are now larger and connected  more closely through a complicated set of \nrelationships.  Often, they point  to the negative impact on the economy caused by last year’s \nfailure of Lehman Brothers.   \nHistory, however, may show us another experience.  When examining previous \nfinancial crises, in other countries as well as in  the United States, large institutions have been \nallowed to fail. Banking authorities have  been successful in placing new and more \nresponsible managers and directors in charge and then reprivatizing them.  There is also \nevidence suggesting that countries that have tried to avoid taki ng such steps have been much \nslower to recover, and the ultimate cost to taxpayers has been larger.  \nThere are several examples that illustrate these points and show what has worked in \nprevious crises and what hasn’t.  A comparis on that many are starting to draw now is with \nwhat happened in Japan and Sweden. \n\n \n \n6 \n Japan took a very gradual and delayed appro ach in addressing the problems in its \nbanks.  A series of limited steps spread out over a number of years were taken to slowly \nremove bad assets from the banks, and Japan put off efforts to address an even more \nfundamental problem – a critical shortage of capital in these banks.  As a result, the banks \nwere left in the position of ha ving to focus on past problems with  little resources available to \nhelp finance any economic recovery. \nIn contrast, Sweden took decisive steps to  identify losses in its major financial \ninstitutions and insisted that solvent institut ions restore capital and clean up their balance \nsheets.  The Swedish government did provide lo ans to solvent institutio ns, but only if they \nalso raised private capital.  \nSweden dealt firmly with insolvent institu tions, including operating two of the largest \nbanks under governmental oversight with the goal of bringing in priv ate capital within a \nreasonable amount of time.  To deal with the ba d assets in these banks, Sweden created well-\ncapitalized asset management corporations or what we might call “bad banks.”  This step \nallowed the problem assets to be dealt with  separately and systematically, while other \nbanking operations continued under a tr ansparent and focused framework. \nThe end result of this approach was to restore confidence in the Swedish banking \nsystem in a timely manner and limit the amount of taxpayer losses.  Sweden, which \nexperienced a real estate decline more severe than that in the United States, was able to \nresolve its banking problems at a long term ne t cost of less than 2 percent of GDP.  \nWe can also learn a great deal from how the United States has dealt with previous \ncrises.  There has been a lot written attempting to draw para llels with the Great Depression. \n\n \n \n7 \n The main way that we dealt with str uggling banks at that time was through the \nReconstruction Finance Corporation. \nWithout going into great detail about the RF C, I will note the four principles that \nJesse Jones, the head of the RFC, employed in  restructuring banks.  The first step was to \nwrite down a bank’s bad assets to  realistic economic values.  Next, the RFC would judge the \ncharacter and capacity of bank ma nagement and make any needed and appropriate changes.  \nThe third step was to inject equity in the form  of preferred stock, but this step did not occur \nuntil realistic asset values and capable management were in place.  The final step was receiving the dividends and even tually recovering the par value of the stock as a bank \nreturned to profitability and full private ownership. \nAt one point in 1933, the RFC held capital in more than 40 percent of all banks, \nrepresenting one-third of total bank capital acco rding to some estimates, but because of the \nfour principles of Jesse Jones, this was all car ried out without any net cost to the government \nor to taxpayers.  \nIf we compare the TARP program to the RFC, TARP began without a clear set of \nprinciples and has proceeded with what seems to be an ad hoc and less-than-transparent \napproach in the case of banks judged “too big to fail.” In both the RFC and Swedish \nexperiences, triage was first used to set priori ties and determine what in stitutions should be \naddressed immediately. TARP treated the larges t institutions as one. As we move forward \nfrom here, therefore, we would be wise to have  a systematic set of principles and a detailed \nplan to guide us. \nAnother example we need to be aware of re lates to the thrift problems of the 1980s.  \nBecause the thrift insurance fund was inadequate to avoid the losses embedded in thrift \n\n \n \n8 \n balance sheets, an attempt was made to cover ove r the losses with net worth certificates and \nexpanded powers that were supposed to allow thrifts to grow out of their problems.  A \nnotable fraction of the thrift industry was insolvent, but cont inued to operate as so-called \n“zombie” or “living dead” thrifts.  As you may recall, this attempt to postpone closing insolvent thrifts did not end well,  but instead added greatly to the eventual losses and led to \ngreater real estate problems. \nA final example -- our approach to larg e bank problems in the 1980s and early 1990s \n-- shows that we have taken some steps to deal with banking or ganizations that are \nconsidered “too big to fail” or ve ry important on a regional level. \nThe most prominent example is Continental Illinois’ failure in 1984.  Continental was \nthe seventh-largest bank in th e country, the largest domestic  commercial and industrial \nlender, and the bank that popularized the phr ase “too big to fail.”  Questions about \nContinental’s soundness led to  a run by large foreign depositors in May of 1984. \nBut looking back, Continental actually was allowed to fa il.  Although the FDIC put \ntogether an open bank assistance plan and inject ed capital in the form of preferred stock, it \nalso brought in new management at the top le vel, and shareholders, who were the bank’s \nowners, lost their entire investment.  The FDIC  also separated the problem assets from the \nbank, which left a clean bank to be restructured  and eventually sold.  To liquidate the bad \nassets, the FDIC hired specialists to oversee the different categories of loans and entered into \na service agreement with Continental that pr ovided incentive compensation for its staff to \nhelp with the liquidation process.   \nA lesson to be drawn from Continental is that  even large banks can be dealt with in a \nmanner that imposes market discipline on ma nagement and stockholders, while controlling \n\n \n \n9 \n taxpayer losses.  The FDIC’s asset dispositi on model in Continental, which used incentive \nfees and contracts with outside specialists, al so proved to be an effective and workable \nmodel.  This model was employed again in th e failure of Bank of New England in 1991, the \nfailures of nearly all of the la rge banking organizations in Texa s in the 1980s, and also for the \nResolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to liquidate failed thrifts. \n \nResolving the Current Crisis  \nTurning to the current crisis , there are several lessons we can draw from these past \nexperiences.   \n• First, the losses in the financial syst em won’t go away – they will only fester \nand increase while impeding our chances for a recovery.   \n• Second, we must take a consistent, ti mely, and specific approach to major \ninstitutions and their problems if we  are to reduce market uncertainty and \nbring in private investors and market funding.   \n• Third, if institutions -- no matter what their size -- have lost market confidence \nand can’t survive on their own, we must be  willing to write down their losses, \nbring in capable management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and \nbusinesses, and begin the process of re storing them to private ownership. \nHow can we do this today in an era where we have to deal with systemic issues rising \nnot only from very large banks, but also from  many other segments of the marketplace?  I \nwould be the first to acknowledge  that some things have changed in our financial markets, \nbut financial crises continue to occur for th e same reasons as always – over-optimism, \n\n \n \n10 \n excessive debt and leverage ratios, and mis guided incentives and perspectives – and our \nsolutions must continue to address these basic problems. \nThe process we use for failing banks -- albeit  far from perfect in dealing with “too big \nto fail” banks -- provides some first insight into the principles  we should establish in dealing \nwith financial institutions of any type. \nOur bank resolution framework focuses on tim ely action to protect depositors and \nother claimants, while limiting spillover effects to the economy.  Insured depositors at failed banks typically gain full and immediate access to their funds, while uninsured depositors \noften receive quick, pa rtial payouts based on expected recoveries. \nTo provide for a continuation of essentia l banking services, the FDIC may choose \nfrom a variety of options, including purchase  and assumption transactions, deposit transfers \nor payouts, bridge banks, cons ervatorships, and open bank assi stance.  These options focus \non transferring important banking functions over to sound banking organizations with \ncapable management, while putting shareholders at failed banks first in line to absorb losses. \nOther important features in resolving failing banks include an esta blished priority for \nhandling claimants, prompt corrective action, an d least-cost resolution provisions to protect \nthe deposit insurance fund and, ultimately, taxpaye rs and to also bri ng as much market \ndiscipline to the pr ocess as possible. \nI would argue for constructing a defined resolution program for “too big to fail” \nbanks and bank holding companies, and nonbank fi nancial institutions. It is especially \nnecessary in cases where the normal bankruptcy process may be too slow or disruptive to \nfinancial market activities and relationships.  The program and resolution process should be \n\n \n \n11 \n implemented on a consistent, transparent and eq uitable basis whether we are resolving small \nbanks, large banks or other co mplex financial entities.   \nHow should we structure this resolution pro cess?  While a number of details would \nneed to be worked out, let me provide a broad outline of how it might be done. \nFirst, public authorities w ould be directed to declar e any financial institution \ninsolvent whenever its capital level falls t oo low to support its ongoing operations and the \nclaims against it, or whenever the market lose s confidence in the firm and refuses to provide \nfunding and capital.  This directiv e should be clearly stated and c onsistently adhered to for all \nfinancial institutions that are part of the in termediation process or payments system.  We \nmust also recognize up front th at the FDIC’s resources and other financial industry support \nfunds may not always be sufficient for this task and that Treasury money may also be \nneeded. \nNext, public authorities should use receive rship, conservatorship or “bridge bank” \npowers to take over the failing instituti on and continue its operations under new \nmanagement.  Following what we have done with banks, a receiver would then take out all or \na portion of the bad assets and either sell th e remaining operations to one or more sound \nfinancial institutions or arrange for the opera tions to continue on a bridge basis under new \nmanagement and professional oversight.  In th e case of larger institutions with complex \noperations, such bridge operations would need to  continue until a plan can be carried out for \ncleaning up and restructuring the fi rm and then reprivatizing it. \nShareholders would be forced to bear the fu ll risk of the positions they have taken and \nsuffer the resulting losses.  The newly restructur ed institution would c ontinue the essential \nservices and operations of the failing firm.   \n\n \n \n12 \n All existing obligations woul d be addressed and dealt with according to whatever \npriority is set up for handling claims.  Th is could go so far as providing 100 percent \nguarantees to all liabilities, or , alternatively, it could include  resolving short-term claims \nexpeditiously and, in the case of uninsured cl aims, giving access to maturing funds with the \npotential for haircuts depending on expected recoveries, any co llateral protection and likely \nmarket impact. \nThere is legitimate concern for addressing these issues when institutions have \nsignificant foreign operations. Howe ver, if all liabilities are guar anteed, for example, and the \ninstitution is in receivership, such inte rnational complexities could be addressed \nsatisfactorily.  \nOne other point in resolving “too big to fa il” institutions is that public authorities \nshould take care not to worsen our exposure to such institutions  going forward.  In fact, for \nfailed institutions that have proven to be too big or too complex to manage well, steps must \nbe taken to break up their operati ons and sell them off in more manageable pieces.  We must \nalso look for other ways to limit the creation a nd growth of firms that  might be considered \n“too big to fail.” \nIn this regard, our recent e xperience with ad hoc solutions  to large failing firms has \nled to even more concentrated financial market s as only the largest ins titutions are likely to \nhave the available resources fo r the type of hasty takeovers that have occurred.  Another \ndrawback is that these organi zations do not have the time fo r necessary “due diligence” \nassessments and, as we have seen, may enc ounter serious acquisition problems.  Under a \nmore orderly resolution process, public authorities would have th e time to be more selective \n\n \n \n13 \n and bring in a wider group of bidders, and they would be able  to offer all or portions of \ninstitutions that have been  restored to sound conditions. \n \nConcluding Thoughts   \nWhile hardly painless and with much comple xity itself, this approach to addressing \n“too big to fail” strikes me as constructive a nd as having a proven track record.  Moreover, \nthe current path is beset by ad hoc decisi on making and the potential for much political \ninterference, including efforts to force probl em institutions to le nd if they accept public \nfunds; operate under other imposed controls; and limit management pay, bonuses and severance.   \nIf an institution’s management has failed the test of the marketplace, these managers \nshould be replaced.  They should not be given public funds and then micro-managed, as we \nare now doing under TARP, with a set of political strings attached.  \nMany are now beginning to criticize the idea of public authoritie s taking over large \ninstitutions on the grounds that we would be “n ationalizing” our financ ial system.  I believe \nthat this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary step that is  aimed at cleaning up a \nlimited number of failed institutions and return ing them to private ownership as soon as \npossible.  This is something that the banking agencies have done many times before with smaller institutions and, in selected cases, w ith very large institutions.  In many ways, it is \nalso similar to what is typical ly done in a bankruptcy court, but with an emphasis on ensuring \na continuity of services.  In c ontrast, what we have been doing  so far is every bit a process \nthat results in a protracted nationalizati on of “too big to fail” institutions.    \n\n \n \n14 \n The issue that we should be most concer ned about is what approach will produce \nconsistent and equitable outcomes and will get us back on the path to recovery in the quickest \nmanner and at reasonable cost.  While it may take us some time to clean up and reprivatize a large institution in today’s envi ronment -- and I do not intend to  underestimate the difficulties \nthat would be encountered -- the alternative of leaving an institu tion to continue its \noperations with a failed management team in pla ce is certain to be more costly and far less \nlikely to produce a desirable outcome. \nIn a similar fashion, some are now claimi ng that public authorit ies do not have the \nexpertise and capacity to take ove r and run a “too big to fail” in stitution.  They contend that \nsuch takeovers would destroy a firm’s inherent value, give talented employees a reason to \nleave, cause further financial panic and require many years for the restru cturing process.  We \nshould ask, though, why would anyone assume we are better off leaving an institution under \nthe control of failing managers, dealing with th e large volume of “toxic” assets they created \nand coping with a raft of politically imposed  controls that would be placed on their \noperations? \nIn contrast, a firm resolution process could be placed unde r the oversight of \nindependent regulatory agencies whenever pos sible and ideally would be funded through a \ncombination of Treasury and financial industry funds. \nFurthermore, the experience of the banking agencies in dealing with significant \nfailures indicates that financial regulators ar e capable of bringing in qualified management \nand specialized expertise to restore failing in stitutions to sound health.  This rebuilding \nprocess thus provides a means of restoring value to an institution, while creating the type of \nstable environment necessary to maintain and attract talented employees.  Regulatory \n\n \n \n15 \n agencies also have a proven track record in  handling large volumes of problem assets – a \nrecord that helps to ensure that resolutions are handled in a way that best protects public \nfunds. \nFinally, I would argue that creating a framework that ca n handle the failure of \ninstitutions of any size will restore an important  element of market discipline to our financial \nsystem, limit moral hazard concerns, and assure the fairness of treatment from the smallest to \nthe largest organizations that that is  the hallmark of our economic system."

            "content": "The U.S. Economic Outlook: \nThe Aftermath of Leverage \n \n           \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n             \nThe Central Exchange \nKansas City, Missouri \nJanuary 7, 2009 \n \n\n \n 2\nI am pleased to once again be at the Cent ral Exchange to share my outlook for the \neconomy.  It doesn’t seem possible that it ha s been a year since I last spoke here and \nsuggested that though the econom y was going to slow, there wa s still the po ssibility of \navoiding a recession.  I thought we might a void the recession if the housing market \nstabilized and the financial sector  avoided further shocks.     \nThe sad truth is that over the past year, the economy has been affected by several \nshocks – the further decline in housing, the tu rmoil in financial markets, and a sharp drop \nin consumer and business confidence. With th e benefit of hindsight, we should not be all \nthat surprised by the onset of these shocks. They are a conse quence of excessive leverage \naccumulated over a decade, about which many of us expressed concerns.   \nThe remedy to what we now face will requi re a rebalancing of domestic savings \nand investment within the U.S. economy. Th is rebalancing process and the length and \ndepth of the recession itself will be determ ined importantly by how quickly financial \nfirms, businesses and the consumer rebuild their diminished wealth and regain their \nconfidence.  It will be influenced also by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented actions \nand funding programs and forthcomi ng fiscal initiatives.    \nThese are challenging times to say the leas t, and for the next few minutes, I want \nto share with you my perspective on them.  I will start with some background on what led \nto this recession and then describe for you my outlook for 2009.  I also will provide what \ninformation I can on the policy actions being ta ken to influence this outlook.  And let me \nsay at the outset that though I agree we must do all we r easonably can to revive the \neconomy, I caution, based on my years of experien ce, that in our haste to mitigate this \nrecession’s effects, we not attempt shortcuts that  put at risk future stability and growth.   \n\n \n 3\nThe U.S. Economy is in Recession \n The U.S. recession, we are told by the NB ER, officially began more than a year \nago in December 2007.  In the third quarter of 2008, real GDP growth was -0.5 percent, \nand recent data suggests that the economy contra cted at a much sharpe r rate in the fourth \nquarter.  Labor markets have weakened considerably throughout the year.  The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 pe rcent in January 200 8 to 6.7 percent in \nNovember, and total employment has fallen by 1.8 million jobs.  And, as evidenced by \nthe November employment report and recent layoff announcements, the deterioration in labor markets has intensified.  Worse yet, economic growth has slowed sh arply in the rest of the world.  Several \nEuropean countries along with Japan appear to be in recession.  As gr owth in the rest of \nthe world slows, so does demand for U.S. expor ts, which was the one bright spot in the \nU.S. economy in 2008. \nFinally, as is usually the case with recession, inflation has moderated considerably \nin recent months.  After surging in the ear lier half of 2008, the head line price indexes fell \nsharply in October and November due to the steep fall in energy pr ices. Core inflation \nalso moderated following weak consumer demand and declining production costs from \nlower energy and commodity prices.  But wh ile inflation is receding for the moment, I \nmust remind you that monetary policy is extremely accommodative, and if it remains so too long, as history suggests it may, inflation pressures could re-emerge as the economy \nrecovers.  \n \n\n \n 4\nFinancial Leverage \n It seems so clear now, doesn’t it, th at the key factor underlying the current \neconomic downturn has been the behavior of financial institutions  and consumers, who \nincreased their borrowing to unprecedented a nd ultimately unsustainable levels in the \nexcitement of the “boom” in housing.  As the r eality of this leverage finally emerged, its \neffects started to show most notably in A ugust 2007.  An asset-pricing crisis eventually \nwidened into a confidence crisis th at spread throughout the economy.   \nBetween 2001 and 2007, in an environment of low and then slowly rising interest \nrates and easy credit availability, financial institutions dramatica lly increased their \npackaging and selling of mortgages in respons e to increased demand for these securitized \nassets.  During this period of rapidly rising real estate prices , these assets were judged to \nbe safe, profitable investments.   \nIn addition, we saw a surge in debt. Fi nancial firms increased the level of \ndomestic financial debt from $8.5 trillion to $16 trillion, or by 90 percen t.  Mortgage debt \nincreased from $4.9 trillion to $10.5 trillion, a 114 percent in crease.  And total public \ndebt outstanding increased from  $3.4 trillion to $5.2 trillion.   The building of assets \nthrough the use of debt was the way to easy wealth, so it seemed.   \nWhen the rise in real estate prices stalled in late 2006, investors became \nincreasingly concerned about th e value of these securitized, le veraged assets.  In August \n2007, the financial crisis emerged, full force, as short-term lending began to seize up.   \nThe firms most strongly affected by these events were, of cour se, those that “took \nadvantage” of one of the most aggressive leveraging periods in fi nancial history.  The \ndebt-to-capital ratios for the largest 10 ba nk holding companies in aggregate increased \n\n \n 5\nover the past ten years from about 14 to 1 to over 21 to 1.  The debt-t o-capital ratios for \nthe investment banks were even higher at over 30 to 1.   \nThe crisis that emerged as the implications  of this leverage became more apparent \nresembled an old-style bank run.  As problem s developed and confidence waned many of \nthese institutions found themselves without funding.  They were unable to sell their \nsecurities in the market give n the concerns about the value of the underlying assets.  \nThese events caused a broad base of participan ts to pull out of the markets to the point \nwhere they no longer function properly.   \nThe resolution of the crisis will occur when the deleveraging process hits bottom \nand financial institutions are able to resume thei r role as intermediaries.  This I suspect is \ndependent on at least two factors.   \nFirst, a stable market price needs to be es tablished for the currently illiquid assets \nsitting on the balance sheets of financial institu tions.  Until these assets can be adequately \nvalued and losses absorbed and future losses staunched, financial firms are going to have \na difficult time raising capital and extending new loans.   \nSecond, this will take time and will not be painless or simple to accomplish.  It \nwill require actions by both the monetary and fiscal authorities that are well thought out, \nwell-defined, fully disclosed, and firmly and consistently executed across all financial \nfirms.  We have learned from events over th is past year that this is no easy task. \n \n   \n\n \n 6\nConsumer Leverage \n A related event having substa ntial negative repercussions for the U.S. economy is \nthe fallout from the leveraging of U.S. consumers.  Between 2001 and 2007, household debt increased from 97 percent of disposab le personal income to 133 percent.  This \nmassive increase in borrowing was reflect ed most vividly through the increase of \nmortgage debt.  The mortgage refinancing boom allowed homeowners to extract large \nquantities of equity from their homes at a time when house prices were appreciating \nrapidly. The overall result was that consumer s spent at a rate roughly equal to their \nincomes, savings rates plunged to zero and borrowing soared.   \nMuch of this borrowing was funded by foreigners.  Between 2001 and 2007, the \ncurrent account deficit increased by 56 percent as our demand for imports greatly exceeded exports.  Foreign holdings of total U.S. Treasury debt increased sharply from \n30 percent to 46 percent.  Thus, while the Un ited States spent, the rest of the world \nsupported our habit.  Now we’re in wit hdrawal, and, yes, it is painful.   \nIn the past two years, household wealth has fallen sharply with declines in house \nprices and equity values.  For example, homeowners’ equity share of household real \nestate has dropped from 55 percent to 45 pe rcent, the lowest value on record.  To \nrebalance and rebuild wealth, consumers are now increasing savings and decreasing \nspending.  As I said, this is a difficult process, and without offsetting adjustments in other \nsectors of the economy, the effect of this reba lancing is slower growth in real GDP.   \n \n  \n\n \n 7\nThe Aftermath of Leverage  \nIn the first half of 2008, the necessary st ructural adjustment began gradually.  \nReal GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent while consumption grew at the slower \nrate of 1.0 percent.  Over the last several years export growth was strong and the real net \nexport deficit decreased.  For a while at least it seemed we mi ght come through the \nadjustment relatively well.  I cer tainly thought it was possible.   \nBut, then, mortgage foreclosure problems  worsened.  In early 2008, Bear Stearns \ncollapsed, followed later by a series of liquidi ty and solvency crises involving the GSEs, \nLehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and AIG.  Fo r investors, there was confusion regarding \nhow each was handled and how future problem s might finally be resolved. The TARP \nwas introduced and changed several times  as it was being implemented.     \nThese events added to uncertainty acro ss the economy, and the financial turmoil \nworsened.  In September and October, credit conditions tightened further, and businesses’ \nand consumers’ confidence seemed to collap se.  Indeed, although th e early attempts to \nstaunch the recession were well -intentioned, it will be a subj ect of debate for some time \non whether the rush to action might have cont ributed to the worsen ing of conditions.   \nIn the meantime, these developments c ontributed to the sh arp decline of 3.8 \npercent in consumption in the third quarter.  And for the first time ever, the level of \nhousehold debt declined.  Based on recent i ndicators, this decline in consumption \ncontinued into the fourth quarter and has served to deepen the recession.   \n \n  \n\n \n 8\nThe Outlook  \n The process of absorbing financial lo ss, increasing savings  and decreasing \nconsumption, the pain of deleveraging, sets  the context for the economic outlook. The \nhard fact is that the sharp deterioration of banking and credit conditions, the deepening \nslump in consumer and business confiden ce, and the ongoing housing correction must \nwork its way through the economy.  While we  must do what we can to mitigate the \neffects of this deleveraging process, to attemp t to avoid its effects entirely is to repeat \npast mistakes and may sow the seeds for the next crisis.   \n Accordingly, my outlook calls for the ec onomy to contract further through much \nof 2009 until later in the year when the effects of policy actions begin to stimulate GDP \ngrowth.  \nStarting with consumption, we will most lik ely see a contraction at least into the \nsecond quarter.  Improvements in both consumption and savings will be hampered by \ndeclines in disposable incomes as firms c ontinue to cut costs th rough layoffs, reductions \nof hours and pay cuts.  This will be particularly hard felt by households this month when the seasonal jobs during the holiday  shopping season come to an end.   \nThe outlook for business spending is also weak.  Conditions in the manufacturing \nsector have worsened, and with this, the dec line in corporate profits  makes it unlikely that \nfirms will expand equipment spending until they see a rebound in consumer demand.  Spending on structures is expect ed to contract markedly due to tight credit conditions and \nwaning demand for commercial building space.    Of course, the outlook for residential inve stment remains weak as well.  Housing \nstarts have fallen by 60 percent from peak levels in 2006, and the inventory of existing \n\n \n 9\nsingle-family homes remains unusually high at an 11.5-month supply. The increase in \nforeclosure rates in the near term is like ly to contribute to additional housing price \ndeclines.  Even the one recent source of strength for the economy, net exports, is expected to slow in 2009.  After a robust expansion of U.S. exports in the first half of 2008, a rapid \nappreciation of the dollar combined with weakening wo rld demand likely halted the \nexpansion of exports in the second half of the year.  The recent decline in the dollar \nshould reverse this somewhat, but world de mand is likely to be weak over the next \nseveral quarters.    Government spending at the state and local  level is expected to slow as budgets \nare cut in response to a dec line in tax revenues during th is downturn.  Government \nspending at the national level will provide a boost to the economy, depending on the size \nand content of the forthcom ing stimulus package.   \n Putting all of the pieces of the outlook toge ther, the picture for the last quarter of \n2008 and at least the first half of this year is grim.  The magnitude of the downturn is \nlikely to surpass that of the 1990 and 2001 recessions.    While this immediate outlook is unsettli ng, over the longer horizon there is reason \nto expect that we can move through these difficulties and be a stronger economy when \nwe emerge from recession.  If we pursue sy stematic policies with the right balance of \nmonetary and fiscal stimul us, the early signs of economic recovery could show \nthemselves as early as the third quarter of  2009.  It would be foolish to attempt to \npinpoint the exact spark for the recovery, but  there are important factors that should \ncontribute to this result.   \n\n \n 10\nFirst, the recent sharp decline in oil a nd gasoline prices does  increase consumer \ndisposable income by billions of dollars, improve their financial position and serve to restore confidence.  Second, while the housi ng market will continue to struggle, low \nmortgage rates and some decline in invent ory will serve to st abilize home prices and \nmoderate housing’s extended drag on the economy.  Third, a gradual improvement in \nfinancial conditions will increase the s upply of credit and encourage demand.  And \nfinally, expansive monetary and fiscal policy will stimulate the economy and serve to offset some of thos e factors pulling it down. \n Inflation will remain moderate over 2009 and much of 2010.  Lower energy and commodity prices along with moderate impr ovement in demand for goods and services \nwill keep price pressures temporarily c ontained.  How prices behave beyond the \nimmediate horizon depends most critically on how the Federal Reserve conducts policy and manages its expanding balance sheet in  a strengthening economy.  This is no doubt \nthe central bank’s most di fficult longer-run challenge. \n \nMonetary Policy \n As I already have suggested, the FO MC has responded to the financial and \neconomic crisis by steadily cutting the federal funds target rate from 5¼ percent in September 2007 to its current range between 0 and ¼ percent.    \nIn addition, to provide continued support for the functioning of financial markets \nand to stimulate the economy, the Board of Governors, under provisions of the Federal \nReserve Act, has authorized the creation of several new liquidity facilities and the FOMC \nhas authorized the purchase of large quantities of additional assets for the Reserve Banks \n\n \n 11\nto hold.  The Federal Reserve has stated that with near-term inflation pressures \ndiminished, it is prepared to provide expanded liquidity to th e markets as needed.  Plans \ninclude implementing a loan program to facil itate the extension of  credit to consumers \nand small businesses. \nThese actions are unprecedented and are a powerful stimulus to the economy for \n2009, but they come with their own set of risks.   First, they are not designed to fix the \nproblems within the financia l industry but to go around the problem.  They were taken \nbecause the intermediation process is broken, and financial institutions are thought to be \nin such a state that they are unable to expand their lending sufficiently to drive the \neconomic recovery forward.   \nAs a result, the Federal Reserve is not only providing liquidity to the financial \nindustry, it is also taking on the financial industry’s role as intermediary to business \nfirms.  This is a dramatic expansion of th e central bank’s role in  the economy.  It is \nreflected most vividly in the combined bala nce sheet of the 12 Re serve Banks, which has \nincreased from $900 billion in mostly Treas ury securities in the fall of 2007 to $2.3 \ntrillion in other assets today, and this will increase still further in the months ahead.   \nThe Federal Reserve must now manage its balance sheet in a manner that not only \nplaces liquidity into the economy but also in  a manner that does not undermine the long-\nterm functioning of markets.  It must design an exit strategy that at the appropriate time \nboth removes excess liquidity from the ec onomy and allows it to withdraw as a \nsignificant intermediary.  Failure to have su ch a strategy risks undermining an efficient \nfinancial market system.   \n\n \n 12\nSome of these facilities w ill automatically dissipate as the market’s intermediation \nprocess returns to a more normal state.  Bu t the Federal Reserve also will have to \nundertake specific, timely actions if we ar e to remove the acco mmodative policy in an \neffective manner.  The importance of doing th is correctly cannot be overemphasized.  As \nI have suggested, we have sometimes been slow to remove our accommodative policy, and in doing so, we have invited the ne xt round of inflation, excess and crisis. \n \nFiscal Policy \nFinally, a critical element affecting the recovery in 2009 will be the introduction \nof additional fiscal stimulus into the economy.  To this poi nt, the current administration \nand Congress have taken actions to recapitalize banks, and the FDIC has greatly expanded its guarantees of bank liabilities.  Bu t these actions might be viewed best as \nholding actions, designed to keep the economy fro m deteriorating furthe r and faster while \nother solutions are developed.  The incoming administration’s stimulus package appears \nto involve expenditures for both s hort-term and longer-term projects. \n The cost of the proposed actions is expected to exceed $700 billion and will \nalmost certainly boost the economy in a time of  recession.  In the longer run, as we know, \nthis too brings risks that cannot be ignored.  It will a dd to our burden of managing a \nrapidly expanding national debt at the same time that we will be confronted with the \nlooming obligations from rising Social Securi ty, Medicare and defens e expenditures.  But \nfor the moment, putting our economy back on it s feet is the priority, and with the \nmonetary and fiscal actions that are underway, we should see improvement as we enter \nthe second half of 2009.   \n\n \n 13\n \nConcluding Comments \n In the end, the greatest challenge that I see for the U.S. ec onomy is not just the \nrecession we are now suffering through but how we choose to address it.  There are no \nshortcuts to stability, no painless methods to adjusting our saving-spending mix and \nreturning to prosperity.  We want to succe ssfully get through this difficult deleveraging \nprocess, rebuild our national savings and wea lth, and we want to do it in a fashion that \ndoes not sow the seeds of the next crisis.  As we provide needed liquidity to the financial \nsystem to contain the crisis, we must be careful to build public confidence by assuring \nthat our actions across financial firms are consistent, open, and understandable to the \nmarket and the public.  We also must be pa tient and consider the long run.  We must \nprovide for an environment of stable prices and manageable debt levels so necessary for \nsustainable growth in our national income.  If  we fail to meet this mandate, we will only \nrepeat the cycle of inflation, excess and crisis."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInstitute of International Bankers \nManaging Financial Crisis in a Competitive World: \nNational Regulation vs. Global Markets \nNew York, New York \nNovember 17, 2008 \n*The views expressed in this speech are solely the those of Thomas M. Hoenig an d are not necessarily those of the Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City or  the Federal Reserve System. \n\n \n \nI am honored to be asked to speak at this c onference.  Today’s program addresses a most \ntimely and critical set of issues — our response to  the current market turmoil and the longer term \nproposals for restructuring the U.S. regulatory system. \nIn setting the stage for this conference, I w ould note that the current  financial crisis is \nposing new challenges for central bankers a nd policymakers, taking them well beyond the \ntraditional framework they have used to address previous crises.  In part, these new steps reflect \ndramatic changes in the financial system — most notably a substantia l growth in that part of the \nmarket not covered by traditional public safety nets, along with a rising complexity in financial instruments, counterparty risks, and institutio nal relationships on both a domestic and global \nbasis. \nThese developments are complicating efforts to  respond to the current crisis, while also \nrevealing serious shortcomings in our crisis management framework.  For example, many of the \nsteps taken have raised important issues with  regard to moral hazard and the subversion of \nmarket discipline, equitable treatment of different  institutions and segments of the market, and \npublic interference in credit allocation and other market processes. \nThese issues strongly suggest a need to look carefully at what we have done and consider \nwhat principles should guide any further steps we take in addressing the cr isis.  Moreover, it is \nappropriate to begin thinking about  how we might construct a clearer set of rules and policies to \nhelp create more resilient fina ncial markets and a better crisis management framework for \nresponding to future events.  Such thought should also include exit strategies for how we can \nterminate the numerous temporary assistance progr ams adopted in this crisis and restore the \nprivate market incentives we have sacrificed. \n 1\n\nMany aspects of the current crisis will be c overed in today’s program, and I have chosen \nto focus my remarks on three policy issues: (1) Ho w will we determine which institutions are to \nbe covered by the public safety net and, accordingl y, subject to close supervision? (2) What is \nthe appropriate scope for central bank lendi ng? and (3) How should we resolve solvency \nproblems at nonbank financial institutions?  Be fore proceeding, though, I would like to briefly \nshare my perspectives on some of the general le ssons we have learned from the crisis.     \nWhat Have I Learned?  \nOne of the most obvious observations from the current turmoil is that a crisis can stem \nfrom parts of the financial market not covered by traditional public safety nets.  In past crises, we \nhave typically been able to di rect our efforts toward banks and other depository institutions \nwhere we have safety nets and a supervisory a nd regulatory framework to address institutional \nproblems and restore market confidence.  Howe ver, many of the institu tions and markets now \nunder stress are not subject to prudential oversight . They are not protected by well-defined safety \nnets and, when assistance is provided, do not ha ve a framework in place to help address moral \nhazard and other policy issues.     \nAlso, when confidence is fragile and the risk  of contagion is gr eat, central banks and \nother public authorities increasingly are compel led to provide extensiv e liquidity and other \nassistance to the nonbank portion of financial market s.  In this regard, it is clear in the United \nStates that whenever threats to financial stabilit y occur, the financial ma rkets, the public, and the \npolitical authorities all look to the Federal Reserve to res pond regardless of where the threats \noriginated.  \nWe should further acknowledge that an enormous burden ha s been placed on monetary \npolicy to respond to the current crisis, although m onetary policy is not designed to address many \n 2\n\nof the underlying factors, part icularly when the problems extend beyond liquidity and raise \nissues of solvency and informational shortcomi ngs.  Going forward, it will be essential that our \nfinancial system have a wider range of policy an d market-based options to resolve crises, with \nless reliance being placed on monetary policy.   \nHow Will We Determine Which Institutions Should Be Covered by the Safety Net?  \nBecause many of the problems in this crisis are linked to institutions and markets not \ncovered by traditional public safety nets, we clear ly need to rethink what our approach should be \nin providing assistance to these segments and, accordingly, in extending oversight and regulation \nto them. \nAs we begin to think about these issues, I believe it is important to have a clear \nunderstanding of what we are trying to accomplish.  In my view, a public policy objective of maintaining financial stability should involve two key features: preventing credit disruptions \nemanating from financial markets and financial institutions from adversely affecting the broader \neconomy, and maintaining the integrity and functioning of  the payments system. \nFrom a historical perspective, safety nets  and supervision have been tailored to the \nspecific charters under which financial institutio ns operate and offer products.  As a result of \ncompetition and financial innovation, many of the di stinctions between financial institutions and \nproducts are eroding.  The current crisis, along with this growing convergence among \ninstitutions, raises many questions  about what criteria  should be used and how far we should go \nin deciding which institutions should operate under safety nets and prudential supervision.  \nIn general, I favor limiting the scope of our federal safety net.  In a number of ways, we \nstruggle in dealing with banks that  are regarded as too big to fa il and in finding the appropriate \nbalance between market and supe rvisory discipline.  Such problems would be greatly magnified \n 3\n\nif we were to permanently extend the safety net to encompass a growing range of institutions and \nmarkets.  I am especially concerned that we  could put ourselves in  the position of mixing \nbanking and commercial activities if we were to extend financial assistance to firms conducting a \nwide range of activities.  Such assistance could put public authorities furt her into the process of \nallocating credit and selecting the winners  and the losers in the marketplace. \nHaving said that, we still need to look caref ully at the safety net issue and think about \nwhat we should do, given the likelihood we will have to deal with problems in the broader \nfinancial markets again.  Can we design a more lim ited safety net for this part of the market, \nsupported by an equally limited system of oversight and regulation?  Can we accomplish this \nwithout stifling the type of innovation that makes our markets more efficient and more \nresponsive to customer needs? \nI am not sure any of us have a good answer to  these questions.  I have several suggestions \nthat I would make, focused on trying to  lessen the need for safety nets. \nBecause overleveraging has been a major pr oblem during the current market meltdown, I \nwould suggest extending some form of leverage standards — a minimum capital-to-assets ratio \n— to those portions of the market that have suffered from inadequate capital.  This type of capital standard would also help reinforce the pr essure that financial i nvestors and creditors are \nnow putting on firms to raise capital and clean up balance sheets. \nIn this regard, I have always supported simple leverage standards for financial \ninstitutions.  If we extend capital standards to a broader range of firms,  a leverage ratio seems \nmore advisable to me than risk-based capital sta ndards, which are likely to be far more complex, \nprocyclical, and, in many ways, easier to evade.  In fact, I am most concer ned that any institution \nthat tends to underestimate its risk exposure — as many recently have — will be just as likely to \n 4\n\nunderestimate its capital need s if allowed to operate a risk-based capital st andard, such as Basel \nII.  Risk-based capital standards may also encourage institutions to lower their capital, instead of \nbuilding it up, in the prosperous time s that typically precede a crisis. \nI am also intrigued by the ideas presented at our Bank’s Jackson Hole Symposium this \nyear for making capital vary in a more beneficial  way over the business cycl e and during a crisis.  \nOne such idea is the use of capita l insurance to facilitate a fina ncial institution’s recapitalization \nduring a systemic financial crisis.  Another rela ted idea is mandatory debt-equity conversions to \nsupplement capital in a financial crisis and to pr ovide more discipline on the part of bondholders.  \nAs part of any such recapitalization, I woul d support the mandatory cessation of dividend \npayments with the loss of earnings. \nSupervisory oversight of institutions that affect an economy’s financial stability is \nimportant.  And, the most difficult aspect of this  is that we balance su pervisory authority and \ncapital requirements against the need to mainta in financial innovation and not drive activities \ninto less-regulated markets.  This is one reason why I would prefer to limit the safety net to \nprotecting the intermediation and payments mechanisms, while gi ving market forces as much \nlatitude as possible to guide financial innovation. \nThere may also be other ways that we can  strengthen institutions and markets while \nlessening the need for safety nets.  I have long supported increased public disclosure.  With the \ninformation problems present in today’s markets, we  need to work with market participants in a \nconcerted effort to improve disclosures and rem ove as much of the complexity and opaqueness \nas we can. \n 5\n\nOverlapping these questions about the safety ne t and eligible institut ions are two further \nissues: the appropriate scope of central bank lending and the reso lution of solvency problems at \nnonbank financial institutions.   \nWhat Is the Appropriate Sc ope for Central Bank Lending?  \nTraditional central bank lendi ng has been through the discou nt window with eligibility \ngenerally restricted to depository institutions.  For the most part, central bank lending has also \nbeen short-term and fully collateralized with sound assets.  During the current crisis, though, the \nFederal Reserve and a number of other central banks have chosen to expand the use of their \nlending facilities. \nFor the Federal Reserve, these efforts have included a number of different measures: a \nTerm Auction Facility designed to increase liquidity among depository institutions; an expanded securities lending program with broader collateral requirements to make illiquid securities more \nliquid; a primary dealer credit facility to increase liquidity at  investment banks; lending to fund \nthe resolution/workout of several large nonbank financial organizations ; and most recently, \nfunding to support money market mutual f unds and the commercial paper market. \nThis broadening of central bank lending reflec ts, in part, the expanding role that nonbank \nfinancial institutions and more complex financial instruments play in the system.  A key question \nnow for central banks is: Should central bank le nding return to its traditional role once the \ncurrent crisis abates, or is this broader role the new reality?  \nBroadening the scope of central  bank lending has raised a number of issues, some old and \nsome new.  A long-standing concern is that cen tral bank lending should not be used to prop up \ninsolvent institutions, allowing them to take furt her risks that could end up costing the taxpayer.  \n 6\n\nBut the broadened scope of central bank lending ra ises new issues as well.  For example, why \nshould institutions and financial markets mainta in much liquidity on th eir own if they know \ncentral banks are likely to provide  it when needed?  Related to this  is the idea that central banks \nmay be subsidizing access to liquidity for a grow ing list of borrowers.  In addition, an expanded \nrole for the discount window may bring central banks more direc tly into allocating credit as \ncollateral requirements are selec tively relaxed and lending is used  to support specific segments \nof the market.  \nWhile it may be too early to decide how central bank lending should be used going \nforward, we should start developing the basic principles that will guide its operations.  Here are \nsome ideas that I suggest for consideration.   \nI have already indicated my pr eference for putting some bounds on the federal safety net.  \nBut if the discount window — as part  of that safety net — is to be  available to a broader range of \ninstitutions, then these institutions should be subj ect to some form of oversight and regulation to \nreduce moral hazard concerns.  This oversight  would help bring lending to nonbank financial \ninstitutions into closer conformity wi th that of depository institutions. \nWe should also think of how central bank lending could be structured to keep it from \nbeing a subsidized source of liqui dity.  Since this lending is essent ially a line of credit, one idea \nwould be to charge a fee for access, and then require institutions seeking emergency access \nwithout a funded line of credit to pay a higher penalty rate.  \nA final consideration is how far central ba nk lending should be extended.  As I noted \nearlier, the focus should be on protecting th e intermediation process and the payments \nmechanism.  Because of the cred it allocation issues and other con cerns, I would argue for at least \n 7\n\ndrawing a sharp line between banking and commerce, with our discount window only used to \nfund institutions and markets that play strictly a financial role.  \nHow Should We Resolve Solvency Problems at Nonbank Fina ncial Institutions?  \nOne other key issue arising out of the curren t crisis is our approach in dealing with \nnonbank institutions that face solvency crises.  Majo r examples of this now include Bear Stearns, \nLehman Brothers, AIG, and Fanni e Mae and Freddie Mac.  In each case, a unique approach has \nbeen followed.  To some extent, these approach es reflect differences in the structure and \nexposures of these institutions. In  some cases there were rushed  decisions on whether they are \ntoo big to fail.   However, it is apparent that we would benefit from a clear set of rules for \nhandling such firms, much like we have establishe d to deal with failing depository institutions.  \nAs it is now, we only have two, more problematic  choices:  putting toge ther ad hoc rescue \npackages or relying on the more drawn-out corpor ate bankruptcy process, which may raise added \nconcerns and liquidity problem s during a financial crisis.  \nWe have some history in the United States on how to deal with large failing banks.  This \nexperience is far from perfect, especially with rega rd to banks viewed as too big to fail, but we \nhave been able to construct a resolution framew ork that safeguards our payments system and \nhelps to maintain public confidence in the banking system. \nFor example, our bank resolution framewo rk focuses on timely action to protect \ndepositors and other claimants.  Insured deposit ors at failing banks typically regain full and \nimmediate access to their funds, while uninsured depositors often benefit from quick, partial \npayouts based on expected recoveries.  Also, a continuation of many banking activities and \nrelationships is likely to occur given such resolution options as deposit transfers and asset sales \nto other banks, purchase and assumption transact ions, bridge banks, cons ervatorships, and open \n 8\n\nbank assistance.    Other important features of the ba nk resolution framework include depositor \npreference statutes and a clear priority for handling other claimants, as well as an orderly \nreceivership process with limited a llowance for judicial intervention. \nIn addition, we have a system of prompt corre ctive action by supervisors and, in the case \nof failure, bank resolutions that impose the l east possible cost on the FDIC.  These provisions \nhelp to promote a resolution of banking problems before they can become magnified and more \ncostly to the industry and, ultimately, to taxpaye rs.  Requirements for least-cost resolutions and \npriority of claimants also he lp to put stockholders, subordina ted debtholders, and uninsured \ndepositors at risk, thereby lesse ning some of the moral hazard concerns associated with the \nfederal safety net.  Exceptions to least-cost resolution can be made when the failure of an \ninstitution could pose a systemic risk, but even in such cases, regulators can still make stockholders and managers bear the risk of their actions.   \nI offer the thought that similar principles s hould be followed in setting up a resolution \nprocess for other types of financial institutions.  The uncertainty that surrounded recent workouts \nof nonbank institutions has not only lowered market  confidence, but also provided inconsistent \ntreatment of stockholders and cr editors.  In addition, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers has \nraised doubts about how different claims will be handled and how long the court and \nreceivership process will take.  \nIn establishing a resolution process for nonbank financial institutions, there are a number \nof important principles to follow and several issu es to consider.  First,  whatever the range of \ninstitutions granted access to the public safety ne t, we must design a process that limits moral \nhazard concerns and encourages market discipline.  In particular, we must acknowledge that the market will make better decisions on capital a nd leveraging when investors and management are \n 9\n\nsubject to the possibility  of loss.  As a result, nonbank re solutions or takeovers should leave \nstockholders and subordinated debtho lders fully exposed to the losses in their firms.  In the same \nway, such resolutions should provide for new mana gement and directors either through a merger \nwith a sound institution or the inse rtion of a new management team.    \nOther resolution steps should be structured to help ensure a continued flow of financial \nactivities, especially with regard  to custodial accounts and any shor t-term claims that might harm \ncounterparties if not resolved in a timely manner.  A continuity of operati ons could be facilitated \nthrough mergers, conservatorships, or something similar to the FDIC’s bridge-bank powers, \nespecially for large institutions that might pose a sy stemic risk if their operations were disrupted.  \nI would also suggest using something similar to open-bank assistance for nonbank \nfinancial institutions that appear to be viable. However, this is only provided the assistance is \nstructured in a manner that does no t subsidize stockholders or creditors or enable institutions to \ntake on more risk.   As in banking, the authority to take action in a time ly manner would help to \nreduce losses and best protect customers and cr editors and their access to accounts and funds.  \nA final set of issues is how to fund resolutions at nonbank financial institutions and who \nwould be in charge of the process.  In orde r to protect taxpayers, I believe that industry \nresources, wherever possible, should be used to provide the major source of funds — much like \nin banking with the deposit in surance fund.  We should be gi ving thought to how such a fund \ncould be established, particularly for less-re gulated portions of the financial markets. \nConcluding Comments  \nIt is clearly time to take a comprehensive l ook at our financial syst em and its regulation.  \nWe have experienced financial crises in many different parts of the world over the past few \n 10\n\ndecades, and the current financial crisis may be  the most extensive one we have experienced \nsince the 1930s.  \nOver the last year, central banks and othe r public authorities have taken a nearly \nunprecedented series of steps — steps that virtually all of us would admit are well outside of our \ncomfort zones.  Also of concern to me is th at recent public actions may result in unintended \neffects, most notably in terms of creating unw elcome incentives, unjustly favoring selected \nparticipants and segments of the financial mark ets, and putting taxpayers  at significant risk. \nTo address these issues and concerns, we need to have a clearly understood framework to \nmake our financial system more resilient in the face of unexpected events and to resolve \nproblems in our financial markets when they invariab ly arise.  In keeping with these objectives, I \nhave tried to present a few ideas and basic principles this morn ing for how we might structure \npublic safety nets, discount window lending, and resolutions of large nonbank financial institutions.    \nThere are obviously many issues to be resolv ed as we go forward, and I will certainly be \ninterested in finding out what id eas all of you have.  I am sure this conference will offer many \ninteresting insights into handli ng the current financial crisis, as well as thoughtful ideas for \nlonger-term reform.   \n 11"

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n            \nInstitute of International Bankers Annual Breakfast Regulatory Dialogue \nWashington, D.C. \nOct. 13, 2008 \n \n\n \nI am delighted to be here today. Obviously, we have experienced several sh ocks in this country, from housing to \nthe financial implosion to the commodity price shocks and now a dramatic loss of confidence in the institutions of credit. \nThe Federal Reserve has been involved in th is from the start. We have engaged in \na new scope of broadening our lending fac ilities and are now lending outside of the \nimmediate commercial banking area. Within  the banking area we have expanded our \nprimary credit. Through our Term Auction Facility, we’re lending well over $140 billion. \nOur primary dealer facility has been invol ved with well over $70 billion of lending. Our \nforeign exchange swaps have been more th an $600 billion. Our money market mutual \nfund liquidity provision has more than $140 bill ion, and we are involved in a commercial \npaper facility as well. In the meantime, we have lowered our fed funds rate from 5¼ to \n1½ percent. Each of these step s has provided important liquidity within the system as we \nhave tried to work through this problem. \nThis is in addition to the other bailouts,  starting with Bear Sterns and continuing \nthrough the most recent $700 billion initiative , which is daunting to say the least. \nNow, the financial industry itself has to step up. While the leadership and actions \nof the Federal Reserve and the Treasury ar e necessary and of utmost importance, we \ncannot do it alone. We need our 21\nst century J.P. Morgan, who also led Wall Street and \nthe financial sector when the nation was in a financial crisis 100 years ago. A very \nimportant part of this is willingness to coopera te and trust one another. Rather than every \nman and woman for themselves, I think the fi nancial industry has to come together and \nsay, “How can we handle this ?” If it doesn’t, credit won’t be released no matter what \nsteps policymakers might take. We have to get beyond the fear and work forward. If the \nFederal Reserve provides liquidity and the Tr easury provides signifi cant capital, then the \nfinancial industry can and should step up to the challenges of making loans to credit-\nworthy borrowers. \nThe regulatory bodies, the Federal Reserve,  the Comptroller of the Currency, the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, along \nwith the other regulatory agencies around the wo rld, also have to fill their role in working \n\nwith the industry, not overreacting, but at the same time pushing us toward solutions. \nThat will be one of our major challenges. \nIf the International Monetary Fund is co rrect, the estimated fi nancial losses for \nU.S. originated credits are a little less than  $1.5 trillion, more than half of that has been \ncharged off and some of that has been r ecapitalized already. So the proposal that you \nheard described here today, I think, has the wherewithal to addre ss the remaining capital \nneeds of the industry \nWe have to show the confidence that th e plan will work and then begin to act \naccordingly if we are going to move through this crisis. The fact is that we have been in \ncrises before, we’ve managed through them and we will do it once again. I was involved in supervision and regulati on during the banking crisis in  the 1980s. During those trying \ntimes it seemed every bit as tense as the cris is we have now. But steps were taken, plans \nwere implemented, we got through it and we were wiser for it. \nI also think it’s important that although problems seem to overwhelm us that we \nstop at this point and look into the future, knowing this crisis will pass. Central banks are \ncharged with being concerned with the long r un, and we need to th ink about resolution \nand some of the reforms that will be needed as we go forward. \nAs we begin this process we must be car eful not to misdiagno se the problem. In \nsaying that, I would also note th at, despite some people’s view s, the supervisory structure \nis not the cause of this crisis. There is almost  an infinite variety of regulatory structures, \nfrom the multisupervisory structure of the United States to the Financial Services Authority in Great Britain. No structure seem s to have done particularly better or worse \nthan another in preventing these imbalan ces, the resulting problems and panics.  \nThe hard truth is the crisis was seen coming and the warnings were mostly \nignored during the boom. The regulators also fail ed to say “no” or insist on contingency \nplans during that boom time. In addition, we  need to introduce better countercyclical \nsafeguards to better assure we do not face this again in the future. I am aware that when \ntimes are good it is very difficult to impose constraints on the inst itutions that are \nenjoying the good times.  \nOne of the debates that will come out of this debacle, for example, is principles-\nbased supervision or rules-based supervisi on. Based on my own experiences, I am very \n\nmuch supportive of a rules-based program. Pr inciples-based solutions usually become \nvague, they’re subject to volumes of regulat ory interpretations and they become more \nprocyclical than countercyclical.  \nI would suggest that any approach we might one day adopt must have three \nelements to it. The rules need to be rela tively simple, understandable and enforceable. \nThe more complexity there is to a set of pr inciples, the less likely  they are to succeed. \nFor example, one of our major challenges will be the Basel ca pital proposal. Risk-\nbased capital, as we have attempted to bu ild it, has become increasingly complex and \ndifficult to understand and has provided too little information to the broad public. \nIn contrast, a simpler, although hardly foolproof approach is the use of the \nleverage ratio as a measure of overall risk to an institution. During this crisis, the leverage \nratio has been the capital measure of choice, more often than any ot her capital measures. \nIf you looked at the investment banks, th e ratios average some where around 30-to-1. \nEveryone understands that. When you look at  banks, it is around 12-to-1, sometimes as \nhigh as 15-to-1. These ratios are straightfo rward and simple. If we set a range of \nstandards around that, I think they would be  more enforceable. I don’t recall a single \ndiscussion of substance over the last several mont hs about risk-based capital, and that is a \nhard truth. \nWhen you have boundaries that are clear, th at set reasonable limits within which \nan institution must operate and they are enfo rceable by the primary supervisor, I think it \nbecomes more countercyclical. We know it will not eliminate the crisis, but it will \nmitigate the damage. \nFinally, let me end by suggesti ng a number of other issues that this crisis raises \nthat we will need to think about as we go forward: \n• As the consolidations continue, we n eed to address the rising levels of \nconcentration of financial resources among a financial oligarchy that will \nwield vast powers in the future.  \n• The degree to which we accept too big to  fail. If we do accept that, then the \npremiums that should be charged these favored institutions for that status.  \n• The oversight required of the entire industry of hedge and equity funds will \nhave to be addressed as this crisis proceeds.  \n\n• The appropriate degree to which the cen tral banks of the world should extend \ntheir lending facilities to staunch financial crisis in the future.  \n• The level of guarantee the government might  give to the assets of individuals \nwho place them in trust of private fina ncial managers and institutions of any \nsize and import. That is extremely important as we work through this crisis and are making decisions today. \n• The unintended consequences should be looked at in terms of moral hazard \nthat are introduced by extending government safety nets now globally. \n• We also need a framework for how we re solve these issues. We need to put it \nin place in advance of the next crisis so we can find a systematic way in the \nfuture. \nThere is much to do. We must use the tool s we have to navigate these difficult \nwaters. The Treasury’s most recent capital pr ogram will be important to moving forward \nand how we implement it will determine its success.  \nI’m optimistic we’ll work through this crisis . Then, we need to turn to addressing \nthe very thorny issues this  crisis has set in motion. \nThank you."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n           \nFinancial Turmoil:  Its Effects on Developed and Emerging Economies \nA Money and Banking Conference at the Central Bank of Argentina \nBuenos Aires, Argentina \nSeptember 1, 2008 \n   \n \n  \n\n 1It is a pleasure to be in Bu enos Aires today to participate in this high-level conference \nsponsored by the Central Bank of Argentina.  Revolutionary changes in financial markets, \ncombined with events such as the market di sruptions associated w ith the subprime lending \ndebacle, have raised anew questions about the role of central banks in maintaining financial \nstability.  Though central banks have traditionally had some responsibility for financial stability, \nsuch responsibility has typically not been plac ed on par with more explicit mandates for price \nstability and economic performance, in part perhap s, because of the episodic nature of financial \ncrises.  Yet, recent market disruptions in the Un ited States make it very clear that the financial \nmarkets, the general public and political authorit ies will look first and foremost to the Federal \nReserve to respond to any significant threats to financial stability. \nIn this context, it may be useful to take a closer look at a central bank’s mandate for \nfinancial stability.  Today, the Federal Reserve plays a role in “crisis  prevention” through its \nregulation and prudential s upervision of banks and bank holding co mpanies.  It also plays a role \nin “crisis management” by providing liquidity to stem financial disruptions and by using \nmonetary policy to reduce the im pact of financial disturbances  on economic activity.  In the \ncurrent crisis, the Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented steps to manage and contain the crisis.  As we examine lessons learned from these events, we will have to decide whether \nfinancial stability can be best maintained in th e future, as some have suggested, by extending the \nFederal Reserve’s supervisory and lending authority to a broader part  of the financial system.  In \ndoing so, we need to examine both the intended and possible unintended c onsequences of such a \ndecision.  Alternatively, if we do not envision a broader role for th e Federal Reserve, we need to \narticulate what other institutional reforms might be needed to avoid a repeat of the recent crisis and to reduce the crisis management  burden on central banks going forward. \n\n 2  A second issue worthy of further discu ssion is how a central bank’s mandate for \nfinancial stability can be balanced with its othe r macroeconomic responsibilities.  For the Federal \nReserve, adding a more explicit fi nancial stability mandate to its existing dual mandate for price \nstability and economic growth raises important an d difficult questions about the compatibility of \nthese responsibilities and the problems that might arise in attempting to achieve them all \nsimultaneously. \nLet me begin my remarks by examining more  closely what is meant by “financial \nstability” and the Federal Reserve’s current role in maintaining financial stability. Then I will \nlook at the changing structure of  the financial system, how the Federal Reserve has responded to \nthe current crisis and the issu es surrounding the possible extens ion of the Federal Reserve’s \nresponsibilities.  Finally, I w ill address some of the possibl e implications of a broadened \nfinancial stability mandate for the Federal Re serve’s other macroec onomic responsibilities. \nFinancial Stability and Systemic Risk  \n \nAs we are all aware, a stable financial system is essential to a growing economy, \nparticularly in terms of providi ng a sound payments mechanism and efficient, sustainable credit \nintermediation.  Since disruptions to this payments  system or credit intermediation process will \ndirectly and adversely affect real economic activ ity, I believe that public policy has an important \nrole to play in mitigati ng these market breakdowns. \nOne aspect of public policy is to provide a resilient and rational framework within which \nfinancial institutions and markets can operate.  History, however, suggests that some breakdowns \nwill inevitably occur within any dynamic fi nancial system and economy.  Consequently, \nmaintaining financial stability from a public policy perspective does not  mean preventing all \nfinancial disruptions, but rather mitigating thos e market and institutional breakdowns that could \n\n 3have a significant impact on aggregate econom ic activity.  A key implication from this \nperspective is that financial losses or the failure of an individual firm, even a large one, does not \nwarrant governmental intervention unless the outcome poses a subs tantial threat to the economy. \nThis public policy role is most  clearly warranted in addressing systemic risks to the \nfinancial system.  Systemic risk can be broadly defined as the risk  that problems at an individual \ninstitution or segment of the market would spread  to a wider set of institutions and markets and \npose a major threat to economic activity.  This type of contagion coul d occur because of the \narray of linkages that may exist among instit utions and markets through counterparty, payments \nand other risk exposures.  While counterparty exposures at large institutions have constituted the traditional view of systemic risk, I would also extend the definition of systemic risk to include instances where many institutions – and not just the largest – are exposed to a common set of \nadverse factors, such as during the real estate, energy and agricu ltural collapses in the United \nStates during the 1980s and early 1990s.  \nCommercial banks have long had a unique role in suppor ting the economy through their \ncredit intermediation activities and in connecting indi viduals and businesses to the payments \nsystem.  These activities have pl aced banks at the cente r of policy concerns over systemic risk.  \nHowever, given the growing role of capit al markets and nonbank institutions in the \nintermediation process, we should begin to ask ou rselves whether these broader market segments \npose systemic concerns that are independent from those already arising from their linkages to the \nbanking system. \nThe importance of maintaining financial stabili ty and addressing systemic threats to the \neconomy justifies the federal safety net and the ne ed for prudential supervision.  We have a long \nhistory of using prudential or safety and soundness supervision of  the banking system to limit the \n\n 4potential risks to this safety net.  The premise behind this approach is that the health of the \nfinancial system can be solidified by monitoring and controlling the risk s assumed by individual \nbanks and by requiring appropriate levels of capital and liquidity to  support their operations.  To \nthe extent these supervisory objec tives can be met, the risk of serious failures and safety net \nlosses can be reduced.  Our changing financ ial markets, though, are now prompting us to \nexamine how far this framework of prudential supervision and safety net protection can and \nshould be extended. The Federal Reserve’s Current Role\n \nAs the central bank for the United States, the Federal Reserve has been assigned a critical \nrole in promoting financial stabil ity and responding to financial crises .  This role is inherent in \nmany of its powers including: banking supervis ion, the provision of liquidity through the \ndiscount window and open market operations, and payments system oversight. \nThe Federal Reserve’s responsibilities for ba nking regulation and pr udential supervision \nare largely aimed at preventing financial crises and protectin g the federal safety net.  \nAccordingly, these efforts encompass capital ad equacy standards for state member banks and \nholding companies, consolidated oversight of the risk exposures and risk management practices \nof these institutions, and corrective enforcement actions to deal with serious problems.  The \nSystem’s responsibilities for supervising hol ding companies and state member banks also \nprovide valuable insights on the operation of i ndividual institutions and banking markets.  \nMoreover, with regard to crisis management, th is supervisory experience and the information \nobtained in the supervisory process have been increasingly important in designing appropriate \nresponses to financial disruptions. \n\n 5To deal with or manage potential crises, the Fe deral Reserve also relies on its authority to \ninject liquidity into the financial system.  Although other regulatory agencies also bear \nresponsibility for helping to ensure financial st ability, the Federal Reserve’s authority to supply \nliquidity gives it a unique role du ring a financial crisis. This role represents a fundamental \npurpose behind the creation of the Federal Rese rve System and the reason why the Federal \nReserve is expected to take the leading role in maintaining financial stability and mitigating \nbreakdowns in the financial markets. \nThe Federal Reserve may inject liquidity th rough open market operations.  To provide \nliquidity in a more targeted manner, the Fe deral Reserve may lend through the discount window \nto any depository institution and may also lend to any individual, partners hip or corporation in \n“unusual and exigent circumstances.”  These differe nt ways to inject li quidity thus give the \nFederal Reserve a choice in how it will supply li quidity to institutions and the overall economy.   \nThe New Financial Structure and the Broadening Mandate for Central Banks  \nTraditionally, the Federal Reserve’s supervisor y responsibilities and it s financial stability \nconcerns have centered on commercial banks.  Th is approach reflects the multifaceted role of \nbanks including: their responsibil ities in the payments system, th eir participation in the credit \nintermediation process, and their role as a source of liquidity and acting as a counterparty in \nfinancial transactions. \nI think we would all agree, though, that the current market turmo il points out how much \nthe financial system has changed over the past se veral decades.  Recent events illustrate that \nfinancial disruptions can arise from outside of the traditional banking channels, while taking on new dimensions and features.  As an exampl e, many of the recent problems arose from \nmortgage-backed securitization activities that not only involved U.S. ba nking organizations, but \n\n 6also brought in a complex mixture of other firms.   Such firms have included investment banks, \nmortgage originators, credit rating agencies, mo rtgage servicers, securities issuers, asset \nmanagers, investors and financial inst itutions across many different countries. \nThis experience clearly indicates that more of the credit process is now taking place \noutside of the banking system and within a mu ch broader global financial marketplace.  \nInvestment banks, in particular, are an important  segment in this expanding marketplace as they \ngo beyond their traditional focus on underwriting a nd distribution of securities and private \nplacement activities.  Today, we can see that inve stment banks derive an increasing portion of \ntheir business from more sophist icated securities and derivati ves activities, mortgage and \ncommercial lending, and the operation of thrift and industrial loan company subsidiaries. \nThe current financial crisis also shows th e extensive and complex set of counterparty \nrisks to which major institutions are now expos ed and the difficulties such risks may pose in \nmaintaining market confidence and addressing probl ems at individual institutions.  In fact, the \ncollapse of Bear Stearns provi des a striking example of how the ramifications of a single \nnonbank firm’s troubles can extend throughout th e financial system, threatening public \nconfidence and complicating any resolution efforts. \nThese developments thus raise a number of issues for managing financial crises.  The \nsheer size of the financial markets, the many diff erent counterparties and the interdependencies \namong participants suggest that significant disrup tions from any portion of the market – bank or \nnonbank – could “freeze” financial transactions a nd activities and consequently harm the real \neconomy.  Most notably, the growi ng role that capital markets a nd nonbank institutions play in \nthe financial intermediation process suggests that systemic concerns can arise independently or \nin conjunction with the linkages that already exist through the banking system. \n\n 7To deal with the financial breakdowns that have occurred in this expanded financial \nsystem, the Federal Reserve has taken several step s that are of a nearly unprecedented nature.  \nThese include opening the discount window to pr imary dealers, taking in a wider range of \ncollateral on loans, lending $30 billion to support the takeover of Bear Stearns, and pledging \nbackup support to Fannie Mae a nd Freddie Mac.  I would note th at such steps are taking the \nFederal Reserve well beyond its traditional polic y boundaries and are broadening its financial \nstability mandate to encompass much more than  the banking system and its usual links to the \nfinancial marketplace and the overall economy. \nAn apt analogy would be to say that the recent market turmoil has taken us to the other \nside of the river from where we have trad itionally operated.  Consequently, we must ask \nourselves if we should stop and stay where we are today, continue and go even farther into this \nuncharted territory, or try to find a way to go back across the river to  our previous and well-\nknown position. \nMore specifically, should the Federal Reserve,  as well as other central banks facing the \nsame pressures, seek to formalize this broader role in financial stabilization?   If so, a logical step \nin this process would be for central banks to ta ke on whatever supervisory authority would seem \nnecessary for overseeing the entities operating in  this expanding marketpl ace and for protecting a \nmuch wider safety net.  Or, alternatively and after the current crisis abates, we could select a path \nthat would take us back to our traditional role and a more carefu lly defined and contained safety \nnet?  Under this approach, ma ny would take steps to strengthe n or provide more inherent \nresiliency to those areas that have suffered the most from recent market breakdowns, which \nwould reflect the positive si de of market discipline. \n\n 8What course we choose is of cr itical importance to the future role of central banks and to \ntheir ability to maintain independence in form ulating policy.  I would like to explore these \nquestions next in terms of two issues:  the a ppropriate use of the federal safety net and the \nimplications for monetary policy under a broadening mandate. Safety Net Issues and Moral Hazard Concerns\n \nThe public policy actions directed toward B ear Stearns, primary de alers, and Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac have resulted in a significant expansion of the safety net and the Federal \nReserve’s lending practices.  Now that more fina ncial activities have gr avitated outside of the \nbanking system, more financial stability concerns seem destined to arise. Our lending to support \nthe takeover of Bear Stearns and to provide liquidity to primary dealers, for example, has taken \nthe Federal Reserve well beyond its traditional approach of injecting discount window funds \nthrough the commercial banking system.   \nThis new financial framework, consequently, le aves us with several distinct choices.  \nSome, for instance, have suggested that we s hould extend more of a bank-like supervisory and \nregulatory framework over the major players in this  broader financial mark etplace in return for \ntheir having access to the discount window and ot her possible forms of public assistance.  \nOthers, though, believe that such ove rsight and safety net responsibil ities could lead to a range of \nproblems and an even more fragile marketpl ace by compounding moral hazard problems and by \nreducing the role that market di scipline could play in strengthening our financial markets and \nfostering innovation. \nIn general, most recognize th at we must think carefully about permanently extending the \nfinancial safety net and the Federal Reserve’s lending responsibilities.  Using the Federal \nReserve’s resources to addre ss breakdowns within a broader financial marketplace will \n\n 9necessarily benefit the a ssisted institutions, and the particul ar market segments or financial \ninstruments associated with the problems.  Also it is important to keep in mind that many other \nmarket participants who have made more prude nt decisions will be left at a disadvantage by \nhaving to compete without such special favors.   For the Federal Reserve and other public \nauthorities, such a role would thus involve a hos t of difficult decisions during a financial crisis \nand would potentially put the Federal Reserve in the position of having to pick the winners and \nlosers from a broad range of fina ncial institutions and investors.  Moreover, as the Bear Stearns \nexperience shows, these decisions may have to be  made in a hurry and with limited information \nin many cases, and any actions will likely raise questions about why some segments of the \neconomy are protected while others are not.  This is a difficult position to find ourselves in and \nits consequences must be carefully weighed before we choose such  a course of action. \nIn providing liquidity or othe r assistance to market particip ants who have made unwise \ndecisions, we risk magnifying the moral hazard problems in financial markets.  These moral \nhazard problems will arise as any substantial pub lic assistance works to undermine market \noutcomes and thereby reduce the incentives that in stitutions and investors have to manage risk \nand make sound choices.  One need only look to  the GSEs Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to \nwitness the effects such favored treatment has in the marketplace. \nPerhaps the most prominent example of mo ral hazard risks is the “too-big-to-fail” \nproblem associated with large commercial banks.  As I have noted in prior speeches, this has \nproven to be a very intractabl e issue for banking regulators.  We all recognize that extending \npublic safety nets, discount window lending a nd bank-like supervision to a much broader \nmarketplace risks creating a financial system of less inherent stability and an ever larger class of \n“too-big-to-fail” institu tions.  Over time it would involve making difficult decisions regarding \n\n 10what segments of the broader financial system  should be supervised, how extensively they \nshould be supervised, and whether this supervision would adequate ly protect the safety net in \nthis new environment.       \nWhen we consider these consequences it become s more apparent, to me at least, that we \nmust strive to limit public safety nets and mi nimize their associated moral hazard problems. \nThere are a number of policy st eps we should consider to help  markets function in a more \norderly fashion and become more resilient to financial crises.  To return to my analogy, this \nmeans doubling back across the river to a more hi storical central banki ng role, and making clear \na future crossing would be rare.  And we must accep t that the credibility of  such an assertion will \ndepend critically on how future crises are handled. \nIf we choose to double back, then we must al so direct more supervisory focus to the \nmarket interdependencies among commercial banks, and we must institute better mechanisms to unwind failing nonbank financial institutions and their counterparty exposures.  We should \ncontinue to pursue initiatives wi th the private sector to increa se market transparency, enhance \ncorporate governance mechanisms and market ince ntives, and strengthen settlement systems and \ntrading and securitizat ion markets.  And it should be clear that major nonbank financial \ninstitutions that seek discount window assistan ce will immediately come under Federal Reserve \noversight. This oversight would be directed towa rd ascertaining the viab ility and exposures of \nsuch institutions and controlling potential safety net losses.   Implications of a Broadening Mandate for Central Banks\n \n \nFinally, let me now turn my remarks to ward a discussion of the macroeconomic \nimplications of broadening the Federal Reserve’s traditional dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment to include more explicit re sponsibilities for financial stability. The events \n\n 11of the past year have been especially useful in articulating the challenges that may arise in \nimplementing a tripartite mandate.  I would like to focus on the following four questions as \nparticularly important to our understanding of how financial stability fits into a central bank’s \nportfolio of responsibilities. \nFirst, can we define a set of principles to  guide a central bank’s mandate for financial \nstability?  This is a key issue for a central bank in determining when it needs to take actions to \npreserve financial stability or, conversely, when it should refrain fr om doing so, particularly in \nsituations when political and industry pressures ma y be calling for a policy response.  It is also \nessential if a central bank is to know when  to unwind and remove policy accommodation or \nspecial liquidity measures.  Defining the principles  guiding our financial stab ility mandate is also \nimportant for central banks in communicating wi th the public and for formulating meaningful \ndebates within the central bank. \nSecond, does a central bank have the ability to effectively pursue a tripartite mandate?  \nThat is, does it have enough policy t ools, and will these tools be effective in a financial crisis?  I \nthink it is fair to say that, at the outset of th e current crisis, central ba nks did not have practiced \nmechanisms in place to provide liquidity to the in stitutions and markets most in need of liquidity.  \nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have shown considerable \nflexibility and ingenuity in addres sing these needs.  It remains to be seen, of course, whether \nsome of these facilities will be made a more permanent part of the central bank’s policy toolkit.   \nAt the same time, it is sometimes the case that the stimulus provided by lowering the \npolicy rate is less effective in a financial crisis  because important parts of the policy transmission \nmechanism are dysfunctional.  This difficulty wa s highlighted in the current crisis where the \nfinancial difficulties centered on housing, which is typically a key component of the transmission \n\n 12mechanism.  And, it was even more dramatically illustrated in the Japane se banking crisis a few \nyears ago where monetary policy was pushed to its limits with very little effect.  As I have \nindicated on other occasions, care must be taken not to ask too much of monetary policy or we \nrisk adding significant inflationa ry pressures into an economy. \nThird, how does a central bank trade off pot entially conflicting objectives under a \ntripartite mandate?  Central banks , for instance, may have more to  deal with than a financial \ncrisis.  In the current situation, we have expe rienced a severe financia l shock coupled with a \nsurge in global inflation.  In th e face of accelerating inflation, it is  important that we not calibrate \npolicy principally to deal with the financial cris is if it involves compro mising to an unreasonable \nextent our ability to achieve our mandate for pr ice stability.  In the United States, core PCE \ninflation has been above mo st definitions of price stability for the past four years and is poised to \nmove even higher over the near term.  The cu rrent stance of policy, while understandably \ncalibrated for responding to the immediate financia l crisis, will make it difficult to achieve our \nmandate for price stabil ity over the longer term. \nFinally, how can a central bank implemen t a financial stability mandate while \nmaintaining the independence needed to actively pur sue its other mandates?  As I noted earlier, \nin the midst of a financial crisis, a central bank w ill likely be encouraged to take actions that are \nfiscal in nature or that directly affect the allo cation of credit by targeting assistance or liquidity to \nspecific institutions, markets or  financial instruments.  Thes e actions necessarily affect \nexpectations for similar actions in the future a nd bring forward political pressures that confirm \nsuch expectations for the future.  In these ci rcumstances, a central bank must be particularly \naware of the difficult trade-offs between its fi nancial stability and  price stability mandate, \n\n 13especially where, like the United States, the central bank does not have a formal objective for \nprice stability. Concluding Thoughts\n \nLet me conclude by emphasizing the broader applicability of the issues that I have \ndiscussed today.  Although I have focused my re marks mainly on the Federal Reserve, I believe \nmany of the issues raised by this  period of financial stress have important implications for other \ncentral banks as financial market liberalizat ion and development pr oceed around the world.  \nMaintaining financial stability in  a changing financial system is a difficult task and, realistically, \nfinancial crises will occur in the future despite our best efforts to prevent them.  Addressing these issues requires a delicate balance between markets and policy intervention and requires \nrecognition of the important macroeconomic implica tions for central banks.  While there can be \nlittle doubt that central banks will continue to have responsibility for financial stability going \nforward, recent events raise important questions  about how this mandate should be implemented. \nFinally, for a market economy to work best, it must to the maximum extent possible find \na balance between financial stability and a stable price environment and in doing so must be able \nto allow individual institutions to  fail. The “Too Big to Fail” issu e will only grow in importance \nas the consolidation of the fi nancial industry grows in both si ze and scope in future decades."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n   \n \n      \n      \nDurango, Colorado \nJuly 16, 2008 \n\n 2\n Thank you.  I am pleased to be in Durango today to talk with you about current \neconomic conditions and the prospects for th e national economy and monetary policy in \nthe period ahead.  As you know, the U.S. economy is in the midst of a very difficult period.  Economic growth has slowed consid erably, employment has declined and the \nunemployment rate has risen.  Despite these developments, there remain some positive signs in the economy and, with current fiscal  and monetary policy actions, we may yet \navoid a recession.  At the same time, howev er, higher oil, food, and commodity prices \nhave boosted inflation, undermining the economy and causing hardship for many households and businesses.    In this environment, monetary policy must walk a fine lin e: supporting growth, \nwhile ensuring that higher food and energy pric es do not cause inflat ion expectations to \nbecome unanchored and lead to a more widesp read inflation problem.  While the current \naccommodative stance of monetary policy re duces the risk of recession, it almost \ncertainly raises the ri sk of higher inflation. \n In the next few minutes I want to  develop these points by providing my \nperspectives on current economic conditions, the outlook for the economy over the second half of the year, and the difficult challenges for mo netary policy in the current \neconomic environment. Current Economic Conditions\n \n Over the past two quarters, we have seen a significant slowing of economic \ngrowth.  Real GDP growth was just .6 percen t in the final quarter of last year and \nimproved only slightly to 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year.  Second quarter \nestimates, which will be released at the e nd of this month, are likely to be somewhat \n\n 3\nhigher, perhaps in the nei ghborhood of 2 percent.  These numbers, while better than \nmany expected, still fall short of the ec onomy’s estimated potential growth rate of \napproximately 2.5 percent.  As growth has slowed, we have seen  rising layoffs and a higher unemployment \nrate.  Over the first six months of this y ear, payroll employment growth has declined by \nover 400 thousand jobs, with the largest job losses in construction and manufacturing.  \nFrom a low of 4.4 percent in March 2007, the un employment rate has risen to 5.5 percent \ncurrently.  There are three primary factors behind this  weaker growth.  Fi rst, the slump in \nhousing construction, now in its third year, ha s taken almost a full percentage point off \ngrowth over the past eight quarters.  Second, higher energy prices have led to a marked \nslowing in consumer spending, with purchases of autos especially affected.  Third, the \nfinancial distress following the collapse of  subprime mortgage lending has led banks and \nother financial intermediaries to restrict the availability of credit, not only for mortgage \nlending, but for other busin ess and consumer lending. \n With these negative factors, many economi sts and financial analysts believed a \nrecession was inevitable in the first half of this year.  However, a recession has not materialized because of strengths in othe r parts of the economy which have helped \nsustain growth.  In particular, with the si zable decline in the dollar over the past few \nyears, U.S.-made goods have become more co mpetitive, and we have seen a boom in \nU.S. exports.  In addition, federal defens e spending and state and local government \nspending have continued to provide a boost to growth and employment.  The Federal \nReserve also has taken significant steps to limit the economic slowdown by providing \n\n 4\nincreased liquidity to financial institutions affected by the subprime crisis and by \nlowering the federal funds rate target to its current level of 2 percent. \n Complicating this picture has been the fact  that as we have eased policy to counter \nthe slowing economic growth, we have seen in flationary pressures ri se.  Price increases \nin energy, food and many industr ial commodities are a ccelerating.  Oil prices have more \nthan doubled over the past two years, and f ood price inflation is the highest in many \nyears.  Overall inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator, \nhas increased by 3.1 percent over th e past year.  Core PCE, wh ich looks at the prices of \nnon-energy and non-food goods and services, ha s increased a more modest 2.1 percent \nover the past year.  But, price pressures a ppear to be building.  Indeed, business and \nhousehold surveys indicate rising inflationa ry expectations over  the near term, a \ndevelopment that bears close scrutiny over the next several months.  \nThe Near-Term Outlook\n \n Turning from where we are to the near-term outlook, I expect only modest \nimprovement in the second half of this year , with GDP growth in  a range of 1 to 1.5 \npercent.  Growth will be supported over this  period by the fiscal stimulus from the tax \nrebates, from further strength in exports and government spending, and from the current \naccommodative stance of monetary policy.  Inde ed, growth is likely to be relatively \nstrong in the third quarter because of the re bates and then may soft en noticeably in the \nfourth quarter.  Housing will continue to be a drag on gr owth for the balance of this year and into \n2009.  Inventories of new and existing homes remain very high in many parts of the \n\n 5\ncountry, which will put additional pressure on home prices and dampen new housing \nconstruction.  In addition, higher mortgage ra tes and reduced credit availability are likely \nto impede a housing recovery.  Still, there ar e some very tentative signs of improvement \nin existing home sales, and my expectation is that housing will be less of a drag on \ngrowth as we move through 2009.  Two other factors limiting second half gr owth are the ongoing strength in energy \nprices and continuing restrictions  on credit availability.  Hi gh oil and gasoline prices are \ncontinuing to sap consumer spending, forc ing households to cut back spending on \ndiscretionary items and especially autos.  Th ere has been a sharp decline in sales of new \nautos, especially SUVs and light trucks, wh ich is likely to continue unless there is a \ndramatic reversal in oil prices.  Credit availability also is likely to re strain growth in the near term.  Going \nforward, the fallout from the subprime debacl e is likely to lessen as the institutions \ninvolved in securitizatio n of mortgages and other asset-ba cked securities move to clean \nup their balance sheets and raise new capital.  However, as the economy has slowed, loan \ndelinquencies on other types of loans have increased, and bank s are restricting credit and \nraising the price of credit to many of their customers. \n Putting the positive and negative factors toge ther, I think that we are likely to see \npositive but subdued growth over the balance of the year.  Strength in exports and government spending, the tax rebates, and a reduced drag from housing should help \ncounter the effects of higher en ergy prices and financial stre ss.  While I believe we can \navoid a recession, I recogni ze that there are significant risk s that growth could turn out \nweaker than I suggest here. \n\n 6\n I am, disappointedly, even less optimis tic about the inflation outlook over second \nhalf of the year.  Indeed, I expect both overall  and core inflation measures to rise further \nover the next several months.  The most recent  surge in energy prices that began in May \nhas not yet been fully reflected in inflation measures.  Moreover, my sense in talking to \nmany businesses is that it has become much more difficult for businesses to hold the line \non prices generally as energy and other materi als prices continue to  climb.  And, with \nrising import prices, especially from China, businesses are finding that they have more \npricing power than in recent years.   \nWhile I have been encouraged by th e small pass through of food and energy \nprices to core inflation thus fa r, I am worried that this patte rn could change quickly.  As I \nnoted earlier, short-term inflation expect ations have moved higher over the past few \nmonths.  Over time, if an inflation psychology becomes embedded in household and \nbusiness behavior, this current rise in food and energy prices could lead to a much more \npersistent inflation problem. \nChallenges for Monetary Policy  \n Let me close with my perspectives on the challenges facing monetary policy in \nthe period ahead.  As you know, over the past year the Federal Reserve has responded aggressively to the financial market disrupt ions associated with the subprime mortgage \ncrisis.  It put into place a number of liquid ity facilities to impr ove the functioning of \nfinancial markets, and it lowered the federal f unds rate from 5 ¼ percent to 2 percent to \nhelp cushion the broader economy from these disruptions.   \nThe continuing rise in energy and food pri ces over the past several months has \nmade the current monetary policy environmen t considerably more challenging, however.  \n\n 7\nWhile a 2 percent federal funds rate may be appropriate in a period of extreme economic \nweakness, if maintained for too long it could allow inflationary pre ssures to build over \ntime.  \nYou may recall the last time we had ve ry large increases in energy and food \nprices was in the 1970s, and thes e increases contributed  to the rise in inflation rates to \ndouble-digit levels in the late 1970s.  You will notice that I said “contributed” – not \n“caused”.  Increases in food, energy and othe r commodity prices can cause a temporary \nincrease in inflation but ca nnot cause a permanent increase.  Indeed, markets work, and \ncommodity price increases invari ably lead to reduced demand and increased supply of the \ncommodities that cause their prices to decline.   \nCommodity price increases can contribut e to a more long-lasting inflation \nproblem, however, if they occur in the contex t of an accommodative monetary policy that \nallows these increases to pa ss through into the prices of  other goods and services, and \ninto higher wages.  This pass through is more likely when money policy remains \naccommodative for an extended period, and inflationary psychology becomes entrenched in consumer and business behavior and ever y price increase leads to expectations of \nfurther increases. \nIf we look back to the 1970s, the reason food and energy price increases had such \na large effect was that inflation had beco me entrenched in the economy.  Inflation \nexpectations had become unanchored because monetary policy had been too accommodative and had kept interest rates too low for too long in an attempt to stimulate \neconomic growth.  Indeed, infla tion had risen to more than 5 percent in the late 1960s and \n\n 8\nearly 1970s, and the Nixon administration had made an unsuccessful attempt to bring \ninflation down through wage and price controls  even before the first oil price shock. \nWhile the comparison to the ’70s can be useful, the present ec onomic situation is \nalso different from that period.  The current increases in commodity prices are occurring \nin an environment in which in flation has been low and inflat ion expectations have been \nbetter anchored.  However, like the 1970s, monetary policy is currently accommodative, \nnot only in the United States but in many other countries around the world.  In this \nenvironment, there is a significant risk that  inflation and inflati on expectations could \nmove higher in coming months.  Thus, it will  be important for the Federal Reserve to \nmonitor inflation developments and inflation expectations closely, a nd to move to a less \naccommodative stance in a timely fashion.  When  to begin the process, and how fast to \nmove, will be difficult decisions for the Fede ral Open Market Committee in the period \nahead.  I can assure you, however, that the Fe deral Reserve takes both parts of its “dual \nmandate” seriously and will walk that fine li ne to maintain stable economic activity and \nlow inflation. \nThank you, that concludes my prepared re marks, and I would be happy to respond \nto your questions."

            "content": "Monetary Policy, Financial Ma rkets and Regulatory Reform: \nA Desperately Unpopular Undertaking \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEconomic Club of Colorado \nDenver, Colorado \nMay 6, 2008 \n\n 2\n  I am pleased to be in Denver and I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you \nabout current economic and financial market developments.  As you know, the past eight \nmonths have been a very difficult period fo r the U.S. economy.  A sharp slowdown in \ngrowth has put the economy at the brink of a recession while, at the same time, rising \ncommodity prices have caused inflation pressu res to rise considerably.  And, to make \nmatters worse, these events have occurred against the backdrop of  a collapse in housing \nmarkets that has shaken financial markets around the world. \n  The Federal Reserve has responded to thes e developments aggressively.   It has \ntaken unprecedented actions to provide increased li quidity to banks a nd other financial \nmarket participants to maintain the functioni ng of financial markets.  And, it has eased \nmonetary policy considerably to try to ensure  that the disruptions in financial markets do \nnot spread to the broader economy. \n   Despite current difficulties, in my view  there is room for optimism about the near-\nterm outlook for the U.S. economy.  Financial ma rkets appear to have stabilized somewhat, \nand the economy should pick up in the second ha lf of the year as fiscal and monetary \nstimulus take hold.  The damage to financial ma rkets is severe, however, and it is likely to \nbe some time before they are able to func tion normally.  Indeed, I believe that major \nchanges in industry practices and a significan t rethinking of financial regulation will be \nrequired if we are to avoid similar problems in the future. \n  Economic Outlook  \n   To begin, then, over the past two quarters, economic growth has slowed \nconsiderably.  Real GDP growth was only 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, and \nthe first estimate of first-quarter growth, releas ed last week, was again only .6 percent.   \n\n 3\nAs the economy has slowed, we have s een a decline in employment and an \nincrease in the unemployment rate.  During th e first quarter, nonfarm payroll employment \nfell by almost 240,000, with most of the job lo sses in construction and manufacturing.  \nAnd, over the past year, the national unemploym ent rate has risen fr om 4.4 percent to 5.0 \npercent. \nMost of the current economic weakness can  be attributed to two factors: the \nongoing slump in residential construction activity and the effects of higher energy prices on \nconsumer and business spending.  Over the past  two years, housing activity has plummeted \nas rising defaults on subprime and other adjust able-rate loans have le d to a severe decline \nin sales of new and existing homes.  With rising inventories of unsold homes, new housing construction has collapsed in many parts of th e country, and house prices  have declined for \nthe first time in many years.  The slump in ne w home construction has had a large effect on \nGDP growth, lowering growth by an average of 1 percent over the past two years. \nIn addition, rising energy prices have sapped consum er and business spending.  \nBecause so much of our oil is imported, an incr ease in oil prices effectively acts as a tax on \nconsumer and business spending.  Economists es timate that a sustained increase of $10 per \nbarrel in oil prices leads to a decline in GDP growth of .2 to .5 per centage points per year \nfor two years. Since oil prices have risen from  $55 per barrel in January 2007 to more than \n$115 per barrel recently, their economic impact ha s likely been to take at least another full \npercentage point off of GDP growth. \nEarlier, I mentioned the potential impact of the recent financial market disruptions \non growth.  Indeed, concern with the effects of these disruptions and, in particular, the \npossibility they could lead to a severe cred it contraction was the principal motivation for \n\n 4\nthe aggressive easing of mone tary policy by the Federal Re serve over the past several \nmonths.  As you know, since September, the fe deral funds rate targ et has been reduced \nfrom 5¼ percent to 2 percent.  Although credit  conditions have tightened considerably in \nrecent months and some markets for asset-backed securities have shut down, we have not \nseen as large a credit crunch as some antic ipated.  Indeed, outside of some mortgage \nmarkets, consumers and businesses with strong credit histories have continued to have \naccess to credit on reasonable terms.  Cons equently, in my opinion, financial markets \ndisruptions, while noteworthy, are not the major story behind the recent weakness in \neconomic activity.  Energy price increases  and housing dominate this slowdown. \nAnother troublesome fact is that accom panying the recent slowing of growth has \nbeen renewed inflationary pressures.  Pri ces for energy, food and other commodities have \nsoared over the past year.  Overall CPI inflation has risen 4 percent from March 2007 to March 2008 and core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 2.4 \npercent over the same period.  It may seem some what strange for inflation to be at these \nlevels even as the economy is slowing, but th e inflationary pressures are not primarily due \nto domestic factors.  In fact, we are seeing significant increases in world commodity prices \nand prices for imported goods, including goods imported from China.  Part of these \nincreases is due to strong economic conditions ab road, but part is likely due to the sizeable \ndecline in the U.S. dollar over the past several years. \nSome would dismiss these rising inflationa ry pressures as temporary.  I believe \nthey are more serious.  Energy prices have been trending up for the past five years, and \nthere are good reasons for thinking that highe r food and commodity prices are not being \nentirely driven by temporary supply and dema nd imbalances.  However, the bigger concern \n\n 5\nis that these increases are beginning to generate  an inflation psychology to an extent that I \nhave not seen since the 1970s and early 1980s.  Measures of inflation expectations in \nsurveys and financial markets are moving highe r, and businesses are increasingly passing \non higher input and commodity prices to cons umers and business customers.  In this \nenvironment, in my opinion, there is a signifi cant risk that higher inflation will become \nembedded in the economy and require significa nt monetary policy tightening to reduce it. \n Turning to the outlook, as I mentioned ear lier, there are reason s that suggest the \neconomic slowdown will be short-lived.  Part of the pickup in growth will likely come \nfrom the tax cuts that are going into effect  currently, part from the monetary policy \nstimulus provided by low interest rates and part from a boost to exports from the lower \ndollar.  Forecasters also see moderation in energy and food costs later this year, which \nwould provide a boost to grow th but also lead to lo wer inflation pressures. \n As I indicated earlier, we are also se eing signs of stabilization in financial \nmarkets, with improved liquidity and more transactions.  Still,  many markets are not \nfunctioning normally, and it will take additional time for the damage to be assessed and \nrepaired. \n As to monetary policy, the current acco mmodative stance should be sufficient to \ncushion the economy from a deeper slowdown and the risks that financial disruptions \ncould spill over to the broader economy.  As the economy  recovers and credit conditions \nimprove, however, it will be necessary for the Federal Reserve to remove the policy \naccommodation in a timely manner.  How fast this occurs will depend on whether inflation pressures moderate or intensify in the period ahead. \n \n\n 6\nThe Financial Crisis and the Federal Reserve’s Response\nLet me turn now to a more detailed discussion of the disruptions in financial \nmarkets that have occurred over the pa st several months and the Federal  Reserve’s \nresponse to these events.  It is  a simple fact of history that , over a business cycle, markets \ntend toward excess optimism in which risk is seriously underestimated.   In some cases, \npublic policy is required to “b ail out” undeserving parties so as to minimize the broader \nimpact on the economy.  It is also a fact that no matter the source of the financial \nproblem, no matter the size of the institution or  the region in which the problem emerges, \nthe Federal Reserve will be part of any solutio n that is developed. This was the case in \nthe ’70s, ’80s and ’90s during the foreign debt, farm, real estate and energy crises and is \nthe case today.  As a necessary principal part y in prudential supervis ion and as the lender \nof last resort, the Federal Reserve is best positioned for this task.    \nMost in this room are by now well aware of the role that subprime lending played \nin the creation of the housing bubble and its co llapse.  However, the problems in the \nfinancial system are much broader and deep er than subprime lending.  Over the past \nseveral years, we have seen the emergence of easy credit availability, new complex \nfinancial instruments and reduced credit standards by many financial institutions.  This left the U.S. financial system dangerously e xposed to an economic or financial shock that \ncould cause widespread defaults and er osion of asset values.  Rising subprime \ndelinquencies provided the spark that started the financial co nflagration, but there was a \nlot of dry tinder to spread the fire and an absence of firewalls and a sprinkler system to \ncontain the blaze. \n\n 7\n In recent years, subprime mortgages, like other mortgages, have been packaged \ninto mortgage-backed securities,  and these securities then served as collateral for more \ncomplex asset-backed securities.  When s ubprime delinquencies rose unexpectedly last \nsummer, investors in many types of asset-back ed securities fled these markets, causing \nsevere valuation declines and losses to the holders of these securities.  Although banks \ndid not make many of the original subprime loans, they held many of the affected \nsecurities and made loans to other institutions  that created and held these securities.  \nWhat resulted was a tremendous liquidity squeeze for the banking system and financial markets as well as large losses as the value of  mortgage and other as set-backed securities \ndeclined.  These strains were felt not only in the United States but also in Europe, \nCanada, and some other countries where banks  and other financial institutions had also \ninvested in U.S. mortgage and asset-backed securities. \n To meet panic demands for liquidity, th e Federal Reserve and central banks in a \nnumber of other countries have taken extrao rdinary steps to maintain the functioning of \nthe financial system.  In the United States the Federal Reserve has made funds available \nto banks and other depository institutions through its discount window and has lowered \nthe cost of these funds.  It has created a new discount window progr am, the Term Auction \nFacility, to provide additional funds to depos itory institutions at a market-determined \nrate.   \n The Federal Reserve also has taken a se ries of unprecedented actions to provide \nsupport to financial markets more generally.  For example, it has broadened the range of collateral in its open market operations and security lending program.  More recently, it \nhas created a new discount window facility for the banks and investment banks that \n\n 8\noperate as primary dealers.  These institutions play a key role in the Treasury securities \nmarket, and their health is important for the Federal Reserve’ s ability to conduct \nmonetary policy through open market operati ons and for Treasury debt management \noperations.  And, the Federal Reserve recently chose to provide direct support to Bear Stearns, a primary dealer, to  facilitate its purchase. \nAs I indicated earlier, financial markets have stabilized recently, in part because \nof the Federal Reserve’s timely actions.  However, many of these actions were short-term in nature, and it is important that more pe rmanent approaches be developed so that a \nsimilar crisis does not happen again.  In my remaining time, I will discuss the longer-term approaches necessary to restoring and maintaining financial stability. \nSteps Toward Financial and Regulatory Reform\n The current financial crisis has reve aled weaknesses both in the private \nmechanisms that financial markets employ to  provide internal discipline and in our \nsystem of financial regulation and oversight.  From the standpoint of private market \ndiscipline, this crisis has pr ovided the first major test of securitization, complex financial \ninstruments, risk modeling, and our new and broader market structure.  Recent events \nindicate dismal test results: Many financial in stitutions and investor s did not adequately \njudge, price or control the ri sks they assumed and did not  prepare well for changing \nfinancial conditions.  All of this occurred despite the wide array of new financial \ninstruments for hedging risks and the substantial advances many ma rket participants \nclaimed to have made in their risk management processes.  \n From a regulatory perspective, existi ng policies and supervisory oversight came \nup short in several areas, most notably in identifying and addressing the exposures \n\n 9\ninstitutions had in certain off-balance-shee t activities and in thei r mortgage lending and \nsecuritization activ ities.  These exposures, along w ith shortcomings in bank risk \nmanagement systems, led to inadequate capital and liquidity levels and to inaccurate \ndisclosures of risk positions to investors.   Other complaints about the regulatory \nframework have included its failure to preven t fraudulent and abusive practices in some \nareas of the subprime market. \nOne other important regulatory concer n is that many of the steps public \nauthorities have taken over the last year to stabilize the financial system seem likely to \nweaken market discipline and extend moral hazard problems to a much wider financial \nmarketplace.  A key example of this, the recen t sale of Bear Stearns, seems to indicate \nthat in a crisis situat ion, public authorities will not be in a position to let market discipline \nplay out when larger financia l institutions encounter proble ms.  Bear Stearns’ collapse \nindicates that such phrases as  “systemically important” and “too-big-to-fail” can even be \napplied to investment banks below the top tier.   \nThe danger from a public policy perspec tive is that a much  broader group of \nmanagers and creditors may no w believe and act as if they  have an added layer of \nprotection from the risks they pursue.  Beyond “too-big-to-fail” concerns, other market \ndiscipline and moral hazard pr oblems may be inherent in some of the recent and more \nexpansive proposals to support housing markets and in the actions the Federal Reserve \nhad to take to provide liquidity to th e market and expand discount window access. \n All of these questions ab out our financial system ar e eliciting many suggestions \nfor reform.  Some have suggested that we should turn back the clock when it comes to \nour efforts to deregulate financial markets, and others are suggesting significant changes \n\n 10\nin the regulatory structure.  However, I believ e a more fundamental issu e is at the heart of \nour problems and should remain the focus of our efforts:  How can we strike an \nappropriate balance between risk and return in our financial marketplace, while developing the public policy steps necessary  to support this framework and promote \nfinancial stability?  \nIn a longer-run context, we have two basic means by which to strengthen and \nreform our financial system:  promote more effective market discipline and implement an \nimproved and more countercyclical regulatory framework. \nSteps toward more effective market discipline  \n For our financial markets to work well, ma rket participants must serve as a strong \ndisciplinary force in rewarding successful ventures and curtailing funding for nonviable \nprojects and investments.  However, as s hown by the current crisis, market discipline \nfailed to prevent an overexpansion in the ma rkets for mortgage finance and allowed a \nsignificant mispricing of  the underlying risks. \nSome of the factors that  contributed to this ma rket breakdown include the \nemergence of extremely complex and hard -to-understand financial instruments, \nshortcomings in regulatory oversight and poor disclosures, financial conflicts of interest, \nand shortcomings in corporate governance.  For instance, evaluating the more complex \nmortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations taxed the abilities of most \ninvestors.  These investors were then left to rely on the credit assessments of loan \noriginators, rating agencies, tr aders, and the managers of he dge funds and other investor \nvehicles, most of whom had competing financ ial incentives.  Of course, the perennial \nfactor in boom-and-bust cycles – greed-induced  myopia – also played a central role as \n\n 11\nmany market participants assumed that we  could not have a nationwide decline in \nhousing prices and that a continuous flow of funds would be available.   \nWhat steps should market participants take to restore their disciplinary role in the \nfinancial system and prevent the depth of problems we have recently experienced?  In the \nnear term, investors can be expected to s how a preference for simpler and more readily \nunderstood financial instruments, while showi ng a reluctance to put  their money in the \ntypes of markets and investment vehicles that  have caused much of the recent turmoil.  \nThey can also be expected to exert more “ due diligence” and to favor the originators, \nrating agencies and fund managers that demonstrate a reputation for providing sound \ncredit analysis and accurate disclosures.  Th ese are certainly some of the most apparent \n“lessons to be learned,” and it will take some time for our financial markets to regain the \nconfidence of investors and meet th is revised set of expectations. \nExperience tells us, however, that as time passes and memories fade, market \nparticipants will always be tempted to rela x their ongoing disciplinary role, particularly \nas any corrective steps begin to appear outm oded in a more prosperous time and as new \nand seemingly more profitable opportunities a nd investment vehicles are developed.  For \nmarket discipline to be most effective over an  entire cycle, it will thus be important for \ninvestors and institutions to work to estab lish a more resilient financial framework.   \nSome key areas for market participants  to work on are: improving financial \ndisclosure practices and devel oping risk management processes and models that reflect a \nfull range of economic experiences.  Other n eeded reforms include establishing stronger \ncorporate governance steps – incl uding a better set of incentiv es for financial agents to \n\n 12\nreduce the conflicts of interest they now f ace – and fostering better control of liquidity \nrisk, clearing and settlement risks, and counterparty risk.  \nA stronger, more countercyclical regulatory framework  \n Weaknesses in our regulatory system reveal ed by the current financial crisis also \nrequire careful thought and action.  This crisis , in fact, is raising questions about such \ntraditional supervisory issues as bank liquidity analysis, capital standards, risk \nmanagement practices and off-balance-sh eet exposures.  B ecause many financial \nactivities are gravitating beyond the banking system and into less-regulated capital \nmarkets, questions about the scope of regul ation and how it can best support market \ndiscipline must be addressed. \n One area where a number of large banking or ganizations and securities firms have \nfallen short is in the amount of capital they were holding against thei r risk exposures.  It \nis clear that many organizations underestim ated such risks and, accordingly, the amount \nof capital they would need.  Th is was particularly true for a number of new off-balance-\nsheet activities of larger banking organizations.  With the transition to Basel II \ninternational capital standards for large banks and the reliance this system will place on bank internal risk models, it is particularly important that we make sure this approach \naddresses the type of problems recently encountered. \nIn this regard, I have a number of concer ns and believe we need to be cautious as \nwe implement the new standards.  First, banks  have had a fairly short history with their \nrisk models and much of the data going into  these models reflects only the period of \nprosperity before recent events.  In fact, tests run on these models over the past few years have suggested that most large banks could safely reduce the amount of capital they hold \n\n 13\n– a premise which has now been shown to be overly optimistic.  In addition, recent \ncapital problems for larger ba nking associations were tied, in  part, to their off-balance-\nsheet operations, and it is not clear whether Ba sel II will address these practices, as well \nas future banking innovations, any better than Basel I.   \nA final concern is that Basel II has the potential to be proc yclical as bankers \nupdate their risk models to re flect new events.  Consequently, if we want banks to have \nthe capital to withstand future crises, I believ e it is important for our capital standards to \nincorporate a longer-term view of risk and fo r banks to maintain a base of capital or a \nleverage ratio sufficient to support all their operations.  A counter cyclical, rules-based \napproach to control leverage is needed.  It must be simp le and observable and, thereby, \nenforceable. \nLiquidity has been another problem for many institutions, particularly with \nbreakdowns in the commercial paper and othe r funding markets, difficulties in valuing \nasset-backed securities and ot her investment vehicles, maturity mismatch problems, and \nquestions about the financial condition of so me institutions.  As I mentioned previously, \nthe Federal Reserve has taken a number of new approaches through the discount window \nto address these liquidity issues.  We will ce rtainly reevaluate these steps in the near \nfuture and decide what worked and whether such innovations as the liquidity facility should be continued.   \nWe will also have to take a careful look at the moral hazard issues that might have \nbeen created by the expansion in discount window access and consider what we can do to change such perceptions.  Other suggestions for reforming the discount window have also \nbeen made, such as converting some of the lending to a “line of credit” format, under \n\n 14\nwhich institutions could pay a fee for standby ac cess to the window.  It is also of critical \nimportance for banking and other financial supe rvisors to review and strengthen their \npolicies on liquidity; otherwise we will face many of the same problems in the future.        \nBecause many of our current financial problems can be tied to asset-backed \nsecurities, beginning with the subprime mark et, we should ask ourselves what can be \ndone to strengthen the regulatory framework  surrounding securitiza tion and to address \nthe asymmetric information problems in this market.  This is a particularly important \nquestion given the benefits that securitization can bring to our credit markets in terms of \nattracting new funding sources and distribut ing risk across a broader marketplace. \nAmong the ideas now being suggested are: (1) tighter registration requirements \nfor loan originators; (2) improved disclosu res by originators and securitizers on the \nunderlying loans; (3) new limits on the types of asset-backed s ecurities regulated \ninstitutions can hold; (4) greater  liability, risk exposure or eq uity positions for originators \nand securitizers; and (5) new regulations for the agencies rating these securities.   \nOther regulatory steps may be necessar y.  For example, some have questioned \nwhether the regulatory framework has kept up wi th the movement of securities firms into \na broader range of activities.  Where such  firms once concentrated on brokerage and \nunderwriting activities, the re cent market collapse has shown that the most significant \nrisks securities firms face are now in ot her areas.  In regard to subprime lending \nregulation, the Federal Reserve has proposed  a number of regulatory changes under \nRegulation Z and the Home Ownership and E quity Protection Act to provide greater \nprotection to consumers and to eliminate cert ain deceptive or abusive practices on higher-\npriced mortgage loans.  These amendments would also extend othe r protections to all \n\n 15\nmortgage loans, including additional disclosu res when lenders advertise loan rates and \nfeatures.     \nA final and very important regulatory issue is what we do with firms that might be \nconsidered “too-big-to-fail.”  With a growing number of large firms linked to each other \nthrough clearing and settlement systems, capital markets activities, and counterparty \nrisks, it is becoming more difficult to avoid s upporting such entities during crisis periods.  \nIn fact, we are rapidly crea ting an environment in which the investors, creditors and \nmanagers at such institutions take it for granted that they will have this added measure of \nprotection when taking risk. \nThere are no easy answers in dealing with this “too-big-t o-fail” issue, but we need \nto take some strong steps if we are to restore the proper ba lance between financial risk \nand return and make market disc ipline effective.  But we must be certain that whenever a \nbailout cannot be avoided, it should follow also  that public authorities assume senior \npositions with respect to stockholders and ot her creditors at these “too-big-to-fail” \ninstitutions. \nThe Federal Reserve, as the nation' s central bank, has responsibility and \naccountability for overall financial stability.  It  has been given the tools of authority in \nmonetary policy, and regulato ry and payments system ove rsight in a decentralized \nstructure insulated from politics to achiev e its mission.  Doing what must be done to \nfacilitate financial stability has always b een the independent Federal Reserve System's \nrole.  It will be difficult.  One has to look no further than  recent news media headlines \nabout the strong opposition to the proposed re gulatory changes in the mortgage industry \nthat I just mentioned to know this is true.  But this envi ronment is not much different \n\n 16\ntoday than at the Federal Reserve's founding.  Thus, as we take on these new challenges, \nI'll leave you with this quote from 1930 to illu strate my point.  It is from Paul Warburg, \nwho was appointed a member of the first Federal Reserve Board by President Woodrow Wilson.\n\"In a country whose idol is prosperity, a ny attempt to tamper with conditions in \nwhich easy profits are made and people ar e happy, is strongly re sented.  It is a \ndesperately unpopular undertaking to dare to sound a discordant note of warning in an \natmosphere of cheer, even though one might be able to forecast with certainty that the \nice, on which the mad dance was going on, was bound to break.  Even if one succeeded in driving the frolicking crow d ashore before the ice crack ed, there would have been \nprotests that the cover was strong enough and that no disast er would have occurred if \nonly the situation had been left alone.\"\n1\nThere are many challenges ahead, many choices to make.  Some I suspect will be \ndesperately unpopular. \n \n \n  \n   \n                                                 \n1 Paul M.

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2008 Institute of International Finance Membership Meeting \nRio de Janeiro, Brazil \nMarch 5, 2008 \n\n 2\n \n \n It is a pleasure to be here today to speak at this forum on regulatory and industry \napproaches for dealing with recent market strain s.  Even as the current financial crisis in \nsubprime lending and structured products con tinues to unfold, we should be turning our \nattention to what changes in financial market structure and regulation may be appropriate \nto prevent a repeat of this type  of crisis in the future.   \n Let me begin with a point that is obvious  but that has very significant implications \nfor how we should proceed in the future.  Th e point is that while the current crisis \noriginated in a small pa rt of the financial system – the subprime mortgage market – it has \nrevealed some very large deficiencies in th e functioning of the overa ll financial system.  \nThus, solutions to the problem need to go far beyond repairing th e subprime market and \nare likely to require sweeping changes in the business methods of fina ncial institutions as \nwell as in prudential supervision and re gulation.  My own views on how we should \nproceed are likely to differ from many of you in  this room, but I hope that they may help \nsharpen the debate as we move forward.   \n It may be helpful to start with a brief summary of my main points.  As I look at \nthe current crisis and other financial crises in recent years, I am struck by the heavy \nburden that has been placed on monetary polic y to cope with the cr isis and its potential \nspillover effects to the broader economy.  As someone who has been active in both the \nmonetary policy and supervisory spheres, I have  come to the view th at we are placing too \nmuch burden on monetary policy in dealing wi th financial crises.  Thus, going forward, \nwe need to focus more attention on meas ures aimed at reducing the likelihood of \nfinancial crises, and we need to place more emphasis on other macro policy options to \n\n 3\ndeal with the economic consequences of th ese crises.  In addition, while I am very \nsupportive of industry efforts, including the IIF initiatives, to improve  market practices, I \nremain skeptical that markets and market pa rticipants can be count ed on to solve these \nproblems without an important role for prudential supervision and regulation.  At the \nsame time, I understand that there are no simp le solutions given the need to strike a \nproper balance between financial innovation and financial stability  across a range of \ndifferent financial institutions that operate in  an increasingly global financial marketplace. \nCentral banks’ roles in financial stability\n Let me start with some thoughts about the roles that central banks play in \nfinancial stability.  As the current crisis  has evolved, central banks have provided \nsubstantial amounts of funds to the banking sy stem to meet the he ightened liquidity \ndemands of individual institutions, and some have also adjusted the stance of monetary \npolicy.   \nThe Federal Reserve has been especially  active on both fronts.  Early on, it \nbecame clear that liquidity demands in this  crisis differed in significant ways from \nprevious crises, and that established lending facilities were not adequately addressing the problems.  Both the Federal Reserve and th e European Central Bank developed creative \nways of dealing with the liqui dity pressures including, usi ng greater flexibility in the \nconduct of open market operations; modificatio ns to existing lending facilities; and the \nauctioning of term credit by the Federal Reserve, ECB, Swiss National Bank, and the \nBank of England.  Indeed, I believe we need to consider whether some of the changes \nthat the Federal Reserve has implemented, such as the Term Aucti on Facility, should be \nmade permanent.  Of course, this will require a more thorough assessment of the \n\n 4\neffectiveness of these programs and possi ble longer-term ramifications on bank and \nfinancial market behavior. \nThe Federal Reserve has also adjusted th e stance of monetary policy significantly \nto limit the potential spillover of these financial disturbances  to the broader economy.  In \nfact, the reduction in the federal funds rate target from 5 ¼ percen t in early September \nlast year to 3 percent today is  quantitatively similar to the aggressive easing of policy in \nthe first half of 2001.  As you know, policy wa s also eased in a number of previous \nfinancial crises in which there was concern th at there might be significant effects on the \nbroader economy.  These episodes include the 1987 stock market crisis, the banking \ncredit crunch in the early 1990s, and the LTCM/Russian debt default crisis in 1998. \nWhile monetary policy can play a key role  in responding to a financial crisis, my \nown view is that we should be cautious in our expectations of what monetary policy can \naccomplish and consider some of the longer r un consequences of excessive reliance on \nmonetary policy.  This is es pecially true when policy is  eased a lot and easier policy \nremains in place for an extended period of time. \nOne of the principal advantages of monetary policy as compared, say, to fiscal \npolicy is that monetary policy can react quick ly.  Even with the surprising speed that a \nU.S. fiscal stimulus package was enacted in this crisis, and even with the longer \ntransmission lags of monetary policy, mone tary stimulus will be affecting the economy \nlong before the fiscal stimulus comes into force. \nHowever, monetary policy also has some significant limitations that, I believe, \nshould lead us to question how much we shoul d rely on it when dealing with financial \ncrises.  First, there may be a build up of in flation pressures if monetary policy remains \n\n 5\ntoo easy for too long.  As I noted earlier, an advantage of monetary policy is how fast it \ncan be put into effect.  However, histori cally, I believe it has been more difficult to \nremove policy accommodation in a timely fash ion, which may have consequences for a \ncentral bank’s longer-term inflation objective.   \nSecond, the monetary policy transmissi on mechanism relies heavily on a well-\nfunctioning financial system and operates th rough the relatively narrow channel of \nsectors that are sensitive to th e cost of credit, such as housin g.  In the current situation, \nmonetary stimulus is facing significant head winds from the weak condition of some of \nthe interest-sensitive sectors, as well as restri ctions in credit availabi lity and a repricing of \nrisk.  In these circumstances, a central bank may have to ease policy more in order to \nachieve its desired effect.  Third, there is a ri sk that an extended period of low interest \nrates may distort long-run invest ment decisions; lead to a sear ch for yield that results in \nexcessive risk-taking; and contribute to the development of asset price bubbles.   \nIn my view, these limitations are significant,  and they lead me to believe that we \nshould look to fiscal policy to play a more  important role in responding to the economic \nspillovers from a financial crisis.  In contrast to monetary policy, fiscal policy can work \neffectively even when the financial system is impaired, and its effects are felt more \nbroadly across the economy.  My own view is  that monetary policy may be a good first \nline of defense, but should not be relied on t oo heavily for too long.  Of course, we would \nhave to rely less on monetary policy to res pond to financial crises if we could, instead, \ntake measures that would reduce the likelihood or severity of financ ial crises.  I would \nlike to turn next to a discussion of some of these options. \n \n\n 6\n \nPreventing financial crises\n As we look to actions that would make financial crises less likely and less severe, \nthere is considerable scope for improvem ent along many dimensions.  These include \nactions that may be forthcoming from the pr ivate sector as well as by policymakers.  I \nwould like to offer a few thoughts on some of these alternatives. \nMarket discipline and market best practices  \n One theme that has come up in discussions of how to prevent future financial \ncrises is greater market discipline.  My views on the role of market discipline are \nsomewhat different from most in the regulatory and academic communities.  In principle, market discipline is a powerful corrective to the risk-taking in centives of financial \ninstitutions.  In practice, how ever, it does not work well in a system of large and complex \nfinancial institutions.  For market discipline to work, investors and creditors need good \ninformation, but more importantly, they need to believe that their money is truly at risk.  \nUndoubtedly, poor information and complexity c ontributed to the current crisis, and steps \ntoward greater transparency and standardization will be helpful going forward.  However, \nI think it is naïve to think that  creditors will view their investments in the largest financial \ninstitutions as truly at risk.  Consequently, I do not think th at increased market discipline \nis likely to be the panacea that some believe. \n I do think, however, that there is considerable scope for industry efforts to improve best practices.  The rapid pace of  financial innovation during the past two \ndecades has made it difficult for both market part icipants and regulators to stay abreast of \nthe changing financial landscape.  However, I think there are limits to what can be \n\n 7\naccomplished here, and I don’t think markets can solve these problems without support \nfrom prudential supervision and regulation.  We  have all heard disc ussions of how poor \nmanagement, lack of investor knowledge and fraud may have contributed to the current \ncrisis.  In my view, the problems go much deep er to the incentives built into the market \nplace by regulation, accounting standards and industry practices.  These incentive problems must be dealt with if we are going to move toward a more stable financial \nsystem.  Finally, we need to continue to re cognize that there are significant externalities \nin financial markets that cannot be internalized adequately by  the private sector and that \nwill continue to require a significant  role for supervision and regulation. \nScope for supervision and regulation  \n In thinking about the scope for supervis ion and regulation in preventing future \nfinancial crises, I would offer an analogy betw een a financial crisis and a fire in a home \nor business.  A fire can have  serious effects on individual st ructures, but like a financial \ncrisis, is also subject to contagion that allo ws it to spread to other institutions.  One way \nof dealing with fires, is to have a fire depa rtment to provide liquid ity to put out the fire \nand help contain its spread.  The role of a central bank in responding to a financial crisis \nis not unlike the role of the fire department.   \n However, most communities do not rely exclusively on a fire department to put \nout fires after they start, but to have policies and procedures  designed to prevent fires or \ncontain them at a very early stage.  These policies and procedures include building codes that require sprinkler systems,  fire doors and flame retardant materials, and also include \nfire inspectors to ensure that these regul ations are being followed.  Again, the analogy \nwith regulation and prudential supe rvision is clear.  My take on this analogy is that in the \n\n 8\npolicy sphere we are relying too heavily on the fire department to put out financial fires \nand, going forward we need to focus more on fire prevention. \n In the area of supervision, I would offer two thoughts.  First, the current financial \ncrisis reinforces the importance for a cen tral bank to have accurate and timely \ninformation on the condition of all institutions  that might make use of its liquidity \nfacilities.  Personally, I believe this is mo st likely to happen when the central bank has \nongoing supervisory responsibilities for all in stitutions eligible to  use its liquidity \nfacilities.  Thus, I am not a supporter of the removal of supervisory responsibilities from \ncentral banks as has happened in a number of c ountries.  If this separation is in effect, or \nsegmented as it is in the United States, I be lieve a central bank must have the legal \nauthority to require this information from  the supervisory agency on terms set by the \ncentral bank.  A voluntary exchange of this im portant information is no more likely to be \neffective in a financial context than it was in the U.S. intelligence community prior to \n9/11. \n As to whether increased supervision can be relied upon to prevent financial fires, I \nhave some doubts based on my years in an ex amination and supervisory capacity.  A key \nfeature in the current crisis is how well know n the build up in leverage and risk-taking \nwas in a variety of financial markets in recent years.  When times are good, as they have \nbeen for many years and banks appear we ll capitalized, it is very difficult for bank \nsupervisors to convince bankers to heed warni ngs that they need to  behave differently.  \nIndeed, in many situations, there may be no le gal basis for requiring a change in business \nor lending practices.  Thus, I don’t think we can expect expa nded supervision to prevent \nthe types of financial excesses we have seen in recent years.  Consequently, while there \n\n 9\nmay be improvements in supervision practices that can be implemented as a post-mortem \nto this crisis, I think we need to be realistic about what we can expect in this area. \n Where we might be more successful in pr eventing future financial conflagrations \nis in the regulatory sphere.  My own view is that we should cons ider hard wiring more \nsprinkler systems into financial markets a nd institutions.  One obvious area to look is \nwhether we can improve the risk-based capital approach embodied in Basel II.  If capital \nis to function effectively, it needs to rise as risks increase and be depleted as losses \nmaterialize.  I think we need to look esp ecially at how we can  limit the procyclical \nbehavior of leverage that we  have observed in some large financial institutions.  In \naddition, I believe there may be merit in cons idering formal liquidity requirements, and \nperhaps loan-to-value ratios for banks and other financial inst itutions, especially the large \ninstitutions that provide liquidity and ri sk-management products to other financial \ninstitutions and to financial markets.   I also  think that it is time that we extinguish some \nof the off-balance sheet fictions that have  developed to excess in recent years. \nConcluding comments  \n In conclusion, let me stress again my belie f that the response to  this crisis should \nbe fundamental reform, not Band-Aids and t ourniquets.  I also think both the private \nsector and government will have key roles to  play in articulating needed reforms and \nensuring they are implemented.  The task is  made all the more complex, of course \nbecause of the broad scope of our modern  financial system that encompasses many \ndifferent types of institutions across a variety of regulatory and na tional boundaries.  We \nalso need to strike an appr opriate balance between the many benefits that can come from \n\n 10\nan innovative and dynamic financial system  and the tremendous costs to people and \ninstitutions that result when fina ncial fires rage out of control."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n          \nThe Central Exchange \nKansas City, Missouri \nJanuary 10, 2008 \n \n\n 2\n Thank you.  It is a pleasure to once agai n join you at the Central Exchange and \nshare my perspectives on the current stat e of the U.S. economy and my outlook for 2008.  \nAs you know, over the past year the economy ha s experienced considerable stress.  A \nslumping housing market has caused weaker gr owth, and higher food and energy prices \nhave boosted inflation.  In addition, risi ng mortgage delinquencies have caused \nconsiderable turmoil in financial markets around the world, leading the Federal Reserve \nand other central banks to take actions to st abilize financial markets and limit the effects \nof these disruptions on the broader econom y.  These developments have led to \nconsiderable pessimism in the media about the prospects for the U.S. economy in the period ahead and increased speculation a bout the possibility of a recession. \n Although I, like others, see a significant slow ing of economic ac tivity through the \nfirst quarter of 2008, there also is a case to be made that growth will strengthen over the \nbalance of the year. And, in my view, the lik elihood of a recession is smaller than others \nare suggesting.  I also judge that in the cu rrent economic environment, the challenge for \nmonetary policy in the coming year is especial ly difficult and will be influenced not only \nby the risk to growth but the risk of inflation.  Let me now turn to a more detailed discussion of the economy’s performance over the past year and my thoughts on the economic outlook and monetary policy in the new year. My comments today represent my ow n views. I am not sp eaking on behalf of \nthe Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve. The Economy’s Performance in 2007\n \n Last year was challenging for the U.S. economy as the housing slowdown intensified and led to significant losses for major financial institutions and disruptions in \n\n 3\nfinancial markets.  In addition, higher food a nd energy prices boosted overall measures of \ninflation.  Despite these challenges, howev er, overall economic performance remained \nsolid as consumer, business and government  spending remained sound and as a lower \ndollar boosted exports to our major trading pa rtners.  Moreover, there were important \nregional differences in economic performanc e, with the Midwest doing significantly \nbetter than some other parts of the country. \nHousing and inflation  \n The big story of the past year, of cour se, was the continuing decline in housing \nactivity.  Since the beginning of 2006, new housing construction has declined by more \nthan 50 percent, sales of new and existing homes have plummeted, inventories of new \nand existing homes have ballooned, and house prices have fallen significantly in many \nparts of the country.  And, unf ortunately, the bottom has not yet been reached as housing \nstarts, permits, and sales fell significantly  in the most recent November data. \n To a large extent, the housing slump re presents the unwindi ng of a surge in \nhousing construction and house pr ices earlier in this decad e that was fueled by low \ninterest rates and ample credit .  Both subprime lending and sp eculative activity played a \nkey role in these developments.  With hi gher interest rates a nd slower house price \nappreciation in 2005 and 2006, however, the hou sing market changed abruptly.  Many \nborrowers were simply not qualified to borro w in the first place, and others could not \nmeet higher mortgage payments when their adju stable-rate mortgages reset.  As mortgage \ndelinquencies and foreclosures rose, higher i nventories of unsold homes placed additional \ndownward pressure on house prices.   \n\n 4\n In the past, traditional mortgage lender s, such as banks and savings and loans, \nbore the brunt of a decline in housing activit y.  However, over the past 25years, housing \nfinance has changed considerably.  Many mort gage loans, particularly subprime loans, \nhave been originated by nonbank mortgage lende rs and have been “securitized” and used \nas collateral for bonds that ar e sold to investors in the Un ited States and abroad.  These \ninvestors are now exposed to this decline in housing activity as mortgage defaults reduce \nthe value of the underlying collateral. \nIndeed, last August, the housing slump t ook a new and unexpected twist as rising \ndelinquency and foreclosure rates on “securi tized” subprime mortgages caused investors \nto flee from mortgage-backed securities.  Th e resulting financial panic affected financial \nmarkets in the United States and a number of  other countries and caused severe strains on \nthe banking system in the United States and abroad.   \nAs these financial pressures worsened, the Federal Reserve and other central \nbanks began a series of actions to restore liquidity to financia l markets.  For example, the \nFederal Reserve attempted to make funds available to banks through its Discount Window.  Its actions included reducing the in terest rate and extending the term on its \nloans to banks.  Last month, the Federal Re serve took additional steps to provide funding \nto banks by introducing a new Term Auction Facility, which allowed banks to obtain \nneeded longer-term funding through a competitive auction. \nIn addition to the direct effects of th e housing crisis on financial markets, the \nFederal Reserve recognized that these financia l disruptions could have potential effects \non the broader economy by reducing credit ava ilability to households  and businesses and \nby damaging consumer and business confidence.  To limit the potential spillover of \n\n 5\nfinancial distress to the broade r economy, the FOMC lowered its  target federal funds rate \nfrom 5 ¼ percent to 4 ¼ percent over the past four months.   \nUnderlying economic strength  \n Despite these considerable  challenges and the attention they have received, you \nmay be surprised to know just how well the overall economy performed last year.  While \nhousing accounts for between 6 percent and 8 pe rcent of total GDP and its decline was \nsubstantial, it was not the only economic event in 2007.  Strength in other sectors resulted \nin good overall economic performance.  Ind eed, even with a si gnificant slowdown in \ngrowth in the fourth quarter expected by mo st forecasters, GDP growth for 2007 is likely \nto come in at 2.5 percent or slightly higher wh en we get full-year da ta later this month.  \nMoreover, despite a decline in construction and manufacturing jobs, overall employment \ngrowth remained solid.  Behind this solid economic growth were some pretty substan tial factors.  For \nexample, consumers, despite the housing slump and higher food and energy prices, \ncontinued to spend.  And, businesses and govern ment continued to invest and spend at \nvery good levels.  A particularly  important factor was a rise in U.S. exports.  Sales of \nU.S. products abroad have surged over the past year, supported by strong growth in the \neconomies of our major trading partners a nd by the decline in the dollar, which has \nreduced the price of U.S. exports. Regional Differences\n \n Finally, let me focus on some signifi cant regional differences in economic \nperformance.  Having spent considerable time  traveling this region over the past year, I \nsuspect that some of you have experienced  a “disconnect” between media reports of \n\n 6\neconomic weakness and your own personal ex perience.  Indeed, there have been \nimportant regional differences in economi c performance across this country.  The \nMidwest and the Tenth District , in particular, have genera lly performed better than the \nnation as a whole.  Part of the regional variation is due to di fferences in housing markets.  \nWhile housing is weaker than normal almost ev erywhere, it has been especially weak in \nthose parts of the country, such as Florida and the West Coast, that experienced the \nlargest boom in housing construction and housing prices in recent years.  For the most \npart, this part of the coun try did not experience the boom and has not experienced as \nmuch fallout from the housing collapse.   \nIn addition, energy and agriculture play a relatively more important role in our \npart of the country, and the strength in thes e sectors has more than offset the slower \nhousing sector.  This performance is reflected in District labor mark ets, where businesses \ncontinue to report difficulty in finding qualified workers, and in state and local \ngovernment finances, where revenue grow th has supported needed spending for \ninfrastructure and education in many District states.  \nInflation Trends and Their Risks  \nUnfortunately, although the housing slump r eceived most of the headlines, it was \nnot the only challenge the economy faced in  2007.  Inflation accelerated at a most \ninconvenient time.  Rising food and energy pric es caused the overall inflation rate to \nsurge to its highest level in several years.   Through November, overall CPI inflation was \n4.3 percent on a 12-month basis, up significan tly from the 2.5 percent rate in 2006.  \nRising food prices were caused by both demand and supply factors.  Higher incomes in \ndeveloping countries and the ethanol boom in the United States have spurred increased \n\n 7\ndemand for many agricultural products, and world supplies have been affected by \ndrought in some producing countries  \nEnergy prices also increase d significantly last year.  Crude oil prices rose by \nnearly 60 percent over the course of the y ear as demand continued to outpace supply and \ngeopolitical uncertainty and specu lative activity also contribute d to higher prices.  Core \ninflation, while more moderate than overall  inflation, is now r unning at a 2.3 percent \nannual rate. The Economy and Monetary Policy in 2008\n \n With this review of the economy as b ackground, let me turn now to a discussion \nof the economic outlook and the challenges for monetary policy in the upcoming year.  \nAs I indicated earlier, most forecasters be lieve the economy slowed significantly in the \nfourth quarter to about 1 per cent from the third quarter’s 4.9  percent pace.  While I am \nnot as pessimistic as some about the outl ook, the fact is there most likely will be a \ncontinued slowdown as we move into this ye ar with many growth estimates for the first \nquarter at around 1.5 percent.   Whatever the final figures, a slower pace of  growth is likely and is the result of a \ncombination of factors.  Part of it is cyclic al and represents some offset to the unusually \nstrong pace in the second and third quarters  of last year.  In particular, government \nspending is expected to slow somewhat a nd manufacturers are reduc ing inventories after \nstrong gains in preceding quarters.  In a ddition, the continuing weakness in housing and \nthe impact of higher energy prices on cons umer spending for autos and other durable \ngoods will contribute to lower growth. \n\n 8\n However, as we move into the second quarter of the year and beyond, many \nforecasters see growth picking up, even gain ing momentum.  This expected pickup comes \nfrom several sources including strengthened  manufacturing as domestic demand remains \nstable and export growth remains strong.  Also, while hardly a rallying point, GDP \ngrowth should be helped to some extent by a slowing in the decline of housing.  Also, \nwhile energy prices most likely will remain elevated, most expect some slowing in the \nrise of energy prices, thus giving consumers some added spending power for other goods.   \nAnd finally, the policy easing that the Fe deral Reserve has undertaken in recent \nmonths will provide additional stimulus  as we move through the year.   \nFrom my perspective, the outlook for in flation is less clea r and therefore of \nconcern.  To the extent the economy’s GDP sl ows to 2 percent or less, we should see \nsome moderation in what otherw ise might be accelerating inflati onary pressures.  But this \noutcome is far from certain.  There remain s, at this point, st rong global demand for \nresources and, in the United States, upward price pressures for both goods and services.  \nThus, while my views on infla tion are not significantly di fferent than that of the \nconsensus forecast, they are, at the moment, on the higher end of views.   \nPulling this all together, I e xpect GDP growth for the year to be in the range of 2 \npercent to 2.5 percent measured  on a Q4-over-Q4 basis.  I also  expect the rise in overall \ninflation to moderate as the U.S. economy slows, but I do not  expect any quick reversal \nof inflation trends, and I ther efore expect core inflation to remain above 2 percent. \nRisks to the outlook  \n While this forecast represents a best estimate, like all forecasts it may not \nmaterialize.  In particular, the continuing fallout from th e housing crisis and financial \n\n 9\nmarket disruptions could lead to weaker grow th.  This outcome would be more likely if \nthose financial institutions that have experi enced losses in recent months reduce credit \navailability to households and businesses.   The resulting credit crunch could reduce \ngrowth significantly below consensus estimat es and represents an important downside \nrisk to the economy over the next several months.  Another way the consensus forecast might prove wrong is its outlook for \ninflation.  While in 2007 inflati on expectations remained cont ained, this could change if \ninflation rates continue to rise .  In 2008, there are a number of  factors that could lead to \nupward pressure on overall and core inflati on and perhaps cause long-term inflation \nexpectations to rise, thus undermining our long- term stable inflation goal.  These include \nthe effects of the weaker do llar on import prices and the sl ower trend productivity growth \nexperienced in recent years.  In addition, if food and energy prices  do not moderate as \nforecast, they could further add to these infla tion pressures.  Thus, another important risk \nto the forecast is that in flation could move higher. \nImplications for Monetary Policy\n \n Let me close then with a brief discussi on of the outlook for monetary policy in the \ncoming year.  And let me preface these final re marks by emphasizing th e view that in the \nconduct of policy, the central bank must take a long-run approach in its selection among \nthe policy options.  Such choices are neve r simple and sometimes not obvious, but to \nfocus on only short-run disturbances is to  assure broader problems as the economy \nevolves going forward.   \nThe FOMC has eased policy significantly ove r the past four m onths to limit the \npotential spillover of financial market disr uptions to the broader economy.  And the fact \n\n 10\nis that many financial market participants believe that more easing is likely in the coming \nmonths.  These views are understandable a nd place significant we ight on the downside \nrisks to the outlook and especi ally the possible development of a credit crunch.      \nBut if the economy continues to expand at  a modest but reasonable rate above 2 \npercent, then the case for furt her easing would be less convin cing, especially in light of \nthe recent moves.  And, if the economy stre ngthens above forecasts, then the risks of \nhigher inflation would increase more significantly.  In this instance, the Federal Reserve \nwould need to consider an unwinding of its re cent policy easing, especially if inflation \nexpectations also move higher.   \nLet me close by recognizing that the economy is faced with some obvious \ndifficult challenges as we ente r 2008.  Growth has slowed as  we exit 2007 and there are \nrisks that the economy could falte r further this year.  But st ill, on balance the economy in \n2007 grew at a solid pace despite the drag fr om housing.  Other sect ors have held up well \nand the prospects for 2008 are reasonably good if these sectors hold up as they have in \nthe recent past.  In addition, inflation, while st ill modest, is on the high side of acceptable \nlevels and we must not lose sight of its harm to the economy if it fails to recede as \nexpected."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n             \nHigh Level Meeting on Regulatory Capital and Issues in Financial Stability \nSydney, Australia  \nNovember 6, 2007 \n \n \n\n 2\n \n It is a pleasure to be in Sydney today to participate in this meeting and to offer my \nperspectives on some of the recent events in financial markets and their implications for \nfinancial stability.  Over the past three decades, we have experienced an increased \nnumber of financial crises in many countries around the world.  These crises have taken \nplace in many different parts of the financ ial system, including: banking and payments \nsystems, housing finance systems, securities markets, and currency markets.  Central \nbanks and other authorities charged with ma intaining financial stability have drawn \nimportant lessons from each of these cris es and have instituted regulatory and policy \nchanges that have helped strengthen the fina ncial system in the wake of these crises.  \nIndeed, forums like this meeting are extr emely helpful in providing a venue for \ndiscussion of these crises and possible policy responses.   \nDespite our best efforts, much like a viru s responds to the body’s immune system \ndefenses, financial crises have continued to return in modified form, requiring ongoing \nvigilance by policymakers.  Moreover, the ta sk of maintaining financial stability has \nbecome more difficult over time because of  the changing structure of the financial \nsystem.  As you may know, many countries are in the process of shifting from a bank-\nbased system of financial inte rmediation to a capital market s-based system.  The pace of \nchange has risen as well, with many new fi nancial products and many new players in the \nfinancial landscape.  In addition, the inte rmediation process has become increasingly \ncomplex, posing difficulties both for market participants and policymakers.  And, with \nthe increased global linkages among financial markets, disruptions in one market may \nspread quickly around the world. \n\n 3\n Unfortunately, we have not adapted ou r regulatory and policy framework at the \nsame speed as financial market developmen ts.  Our main regulatory and supervisory \npolicies and our central bank liquidity facilities are best positioned to deal with traditional \nbanking crises, and appear less ad equate to deal with crises that increasingly originate in \nfinancial markets and outside the banking system.  In my remarks today, I would like to use the recent subprime mortgage crisis to \nmotivate a broader discussion of how we can ma intain financial stability in a changing \nfinancial system.  While the recent crisis  has revealed some new and unexpected \nvulnerabilities in the financia l system, it has also highlighted the need to remember some \nof the lessons we have learned from past cr ises–as indicated by the title of my speech. \nRecent Evolution of the Financial System\n \n Let me begin my discussion with so me general comments on the sweeping \nchanges we are seeing in fi nancial systems around the worl d.  The key development in \nthis changing framework is the evoluti on from a bank-based system of financial \nintermediation to a market-based system.  Banks retain an important but increasingly \ndifferent role in financial intermediation.  For the larger banking organizations, activities \nand earnings are now focused more on loan originations and credit risk management \nservices, and less on holding loans on the bala nce sheet to generate interest income.  \nWhile some of these developments may be further along in the United States, \nsimilar trends are evident throughout the worl d.  In this new system, investors can be \nvery far removed from borrowers, relying on a number of agents to ensure the smooth \nfunctioning of the system.  With the incr eased linkages among financial systems around \n\n 4\nthe world, financial instruments and claims  pass through many hands and often wind up \nfar from their origins.      Several factors are behind these dramatic changes in the financial framework.  One key factor is the enormous growth in the amount of funds managed by large \ninstitutional investors such as pension and mutual funds.  Equally important are \ntechnological innovations in information processing and telecommunications.  The \nsignificance of these innovations  can be seen in the greatly  expanded access to timely \nfinancial information by investors and institutio ns, the substantial reduc tion in the cost of \ngathering and processing su ch data, and the unimpeded flow of information and \ncommunications around the world.   \nAccompanying these developments are adva nces in financial theory, which have \nmade it possible for market participants to de velop mathematical models to price a wide \nvariety of new financial instruments.  This financial engineering is  also allowing banks \nand others to break up the payment flows on de bt obligations and partition them into a \nwide array of risk tranches, thus allowing firms and invest ors to actively manage their \nrisk exposures and select the level of risk  they are willing to incur.         \n   The rising importance of market-based finance is leading to several significant \nchanges in the banking industry.  With lend ing for their own portfolios declining in \nimportance, banks are expanding their operations  in other areas, incl uding trading, market \nmaking, investment banking, and risk manageme nt products for themselves and others.  \nAnd while the banking industry is still the larg est holder of credit market obligations in \nthe United States, this lending has moved aw ay from large corporate lending and now \n\n 5\nincludes more credit card and real estate c onstruction lending, and loan origination and \nsecuritization activities.   \nThis changing loan focus, in part, reflects the increased availability of information \nin financial markets and the efficiencies in using these markets.  At the same time, the regulatory and supervisory framework is sh aping what banks can do.  For example, \nregulation and capital requireme nts may be making it too costly for banks to hold high-\nquality assets on the balance sh eet and to compete directly in certain market segments. \n One important consequence of these changes in financial structure is that we have \nseen an evolution in the nature and location of financial crises.  Key events in recent \ncrises, for instance, have often originated outside of the banking system.  In fact, the \nname most commonly ascribed to recent events has been “market turmoil.”  Another \ncharacteristic of recent events and crises is that they have spread across countries and, in \nmany cases, through surprising and unexpected  linkages.  These developments have \nraised new challenges for policymakers about  how the effects of these crises can be \ncontained and whether conventional policy t ools will provide the most desirable and \neffective response.  But, they also raise new concerns about moral hazard. \nA Conceptual Framework\n \n Before I talk more specifically about th e recent subprime mortga ge crisis and its \nramifications, it may be helpful to review th e key factors that underp in the functioning of \nthe financial system and the need for policy in tervention to maintain financial stability.  \nAt a very basic level, financial interm ediation, whether bank-centered or market-\ncentered, requires overcoming asymmetric information and agency problems.  And, \n\n 6\nfinancial intermediation has associated extern alities that provide an important role for \npublic policy.    \nTraditional methods of overcoming problem s of asymmetric information include: \nestablishing long-term relationships with borro wers, requiring specifi c equity or capital \nlevels to be maintained, requiring collateral in support of a loan, im posing restrictions on \na borrower’s activities and use of loan proceed s, and asking for third-party guarantees of \nloan contract performance.  Fundamentally, the shift of intermediation from banks to \nmarkets can be understood in te rms of markets gaining access to more information on \nwhich to base their funding decisions and havi ng the tools, such as credit scoring, to use \nthis information efficiently. \nAgency problems also complicate the inte rmediation process when the incentives \nof agents are not aligned well w ith the principles they represent.  In a bank-based system \nof intermediation, banks serve to  internalize many of these ag ency problems.  In the new \nmarket-based system of finance, the growi ng complexity of the intermediation process \nand the increasing number of players that are involved in intermediated transactions are \nleaving investors, savers, and borrowers much  more dependent on the actions and advice \nof others, many of whom may have comp eting objectives and incentives.  This \nmisalignment of incentives may play a role in destabilizing parts of the intermediation \nprocess and, more genera lly, the financial system. \nFinally, the financial system exhibits impor tant externalities that can lead to a \nmarket failure and require public intervention to address or realign the focus of market \nparticipants.  Moreover, given the interc onnected nature of financial markets and \npayments systems–both on a domestic and an  international level–the shocks or \n\n 7\nbreakdowns in one sector caused by external ities can be readily transmitted to other \nsectors, thereby having systemic implications. \nThe presence of externalities justif ies a strong role for public policy in \nmaintaining and improving the efficiency and stability of the financial system.  At a \nmicro or institutional level, these policie s include standard setting, regulation, and \nsupervision.  But there ar e also connections at th e macro level where overall \nmacroeconomic stability can promote financia l stability and where financial instability \ncan affect and impair macroeconomic performance. \nAs we step back and look at the recent  subprime crisis, I find it very helpful to \nframe my thoughts in terms of these issues.  For example, my take on the recent subprime \ncrisis is that the mechanisms that have  been developed to overcome asymmetric \ninformation and agency problems in financial markets are much less robust than we may \nhave thought.  In the case of externalities, my sense is that our traditional policy \napproaches, which are designed for a bank-base d financial system, ma y not be as well-\nsuited to our new, market-b ased financial system.   \nA Closer Look at Recent Events  \n  With these ideas providing a frame of refe rence, I would now like to take a closer \nlook at the recent U.S. subprime mortgage cris is and its ramifications for the financial \nsystem.  Rather than providing a detailed disc ussion of the evolution of the crisis, which \nhas been well-documented by others, I would lik e to highlight three areas that I believe \npolicymakers should focus on as we try to stre ngthen the financial sy stem in response to \nthese developments. \n \n\n 8\nLiquidity strains \n While the root of the subprime crisis lies in traditional concerns about credit \nquality and credit risk, I believe more at tention should focus on the severe liquidity \nstrains that enveloped financial markets and wh ich continue, to some extent, even today.  \nAs you may know, much of U.S.  mortgage finance in recen t years has flowed through \ninstitutions outside of the de pository system and outside of the formal bank supervisory \nand regulatory process.  Many of these inst itutions behaved like traditional depository \ninstitutions in borrowing short and lending l ong.  With no deposit base, these institutions \nobtained funding in short-term money market s using asset-backed commercial paper.  \n When concerns about subprime credit quality heightened over the summer, \ninvestors ran for cover.  Those institutions without backup lines of credit were forced to \nsell assets, typically at a larg e loss, and a number were liquida ted.  Those institutions with \nbackup lines of credit with banks were, in many but not all cases, able  to obtain funding.  \nHowever, banks were not well-positioned to meet these demands, and their funding \nrequirements placed enormous strains on money ma rkets in Europe and the United States.   \nAnd, as you know, these funding pressures ne cessitated massive amounts of reserve \nprovision by central banks through open ma rket operations and lending facilities. \n In many respects, these are events we have seen before in periods of banking \ncrises.  What is new is that the initial probl ems are arising in institutions outside of our \nregulatory and supervisory purview and without  direct access to traditional elements of \nthe safety net–deposit insurance and access to central bank lender-of-la st-resort facilities. \nMoreover, the problems are spilling over very  quickly into the banking system.  In \naddition to direct exposure thr ough lines of credit, banks have taken an active role in \n\n 9\nsetting up some of these off-balance-sheet en tities and may be holding similar securities \nin their investment and trading portfolios.  But there is another new dimension to liqui dity that has raised the ante in coping \nwith financial crises.  As we have shifted from a bank-based system to a market system \nof finance, the functioning of markets in periods  of crisis has become  critical.  Beginning \nwith the U.S. stock market crash in 1 987; then in the Asian, Long-Term Capital \nManagement, and international de bt crisis in 1997-98; and no w in the subprime mortgage \ncrisis, we have seen repeated instances in which markets have seized up and ceased to \nfunction, just when they are most needed.  Th is poses serious problem s for those financial \ninstitutions that do not have adequate portfo lio liquidity and rely on markets to obtain \nliquidity.  In addition, without well-functioning markets to establish prices for securities, \nit becomes extremely difficult to do the valuatio n exercises that are required by our mark-\nto-market accounting systems. Asset valuation  \n Indeed, the difficulty in valu ing assets in the recent crisis rais es a second serious \nconcern about our increased reliance on asse t valuation models.  These models require \ngood data on the credit experience and volatilities of the underlyi ng assets.  But, they also \nrequire good judgment in their application.  The subprime crisis has revealed appalling \nweaknesses in both regards.  Subprime loans do not have a very long history, and their \nrecent history is somewhat deceptive because many were made in a period of rapidly \nrising house prices.  Thus, va luation of these loans relied  very heavily on a judgmental \nbet that the benign market conditions of recent years would continue.  In addition, \nvaluation exercises did not appear to make  sufficient distinctions between types of \n\n 10\nmortgage contracts offered to subprime borrowe rs.  A fixed-rate, 80 percent loan-to-value \nratio loan is a very different  product from a variable-rate, 100 percent loan-to-value loan \neven if they are made to subprime bo rrowers with the same credit score. \n I do not think these valuation problems ar e confined to assets backed by subprime \nloans.  Indeed, they are likely to be very  pervasive across asset classes because of the \nbenign financial conditions of recent years a nd the proliferation of  nonstandard terms in \ncontracts and bond covenants. \nProblems in asymmetric information  \n A third issue that I would like to focus on is weaknesses that have been exposed \nin financial markets mechanisms for overc oming asymmetric information and agency \nproblems.  As I noted earlier, the phenomen al growth of financial markets in recent \ndecades is largely a result of the development of methods  to get around these problems. \nIn particular, credit ratings have become ex tremely important in supporting the growth in \nasset-backed lending.  Why else would inve stors around the world buy assets backed by \nloans to U.S. borrowers with low credit ratings?  Until a few months ago, investors \nviewed credit ratings on privately issued mortga ge backed securities as almost equivalent \nto the implicit government guarantees on GSE- backed securities.  Many investors have \nnow discovered the difference between an opinion and a guarantee.  Because credit ratings play such an impor tant role in the functioning of markets \nand in Basel II standards, I believe it is extremely important to understand what went \nwrong.  Despite the self-serving responses of some of the ra ting agencies, I believe there \nare some very serious issues to be addr essed.  One important issue is the incentive \nconflict that arises because the agencies receive compensation from the companies who \n\n 11\nare obtaining the ratings.  Anot her issue is the models used by the agencies to rate \nstructured securities and the judgmen t used in the rating process.   \nAs an example, consider a recent story by Allan Sloan in Fortune  magazine.  \nAccording to Sloan, a mortgage trust asse mbled by a prominent investment bank had a \nportfolio of second mortgage loans that had essentially no borrower equity and had little \nor no documentation on more than half the lo ans.  Amazingly, 93 percent of the tranches \nwere rated investment grade by the two main credit-rating agencies.  As of September, 18 \npercent of the loans had defaulted, wiping out many of the lower-rated tranches. \nAnother lesson that markets have “rel earned” from recent events is the \nimportance of equity in disc iplining behavior.  Many of the subprime loans made in \nrecent years contained very low homeowner equity.  Moreover, as the example above \nindicates, much of the so-called equity in these loans was in fact borrowed from other \nlenders through a second mortgage.  With no equ ity and with interest rate resets requiring \nmuch higher payments, the viability of th ese loans depended almost entirely on rapid \nappreciation in house prices.  Of course, issues  of excessive leverage in financial markets \nare not confined to subprime mortgage lending.  \nThere are similar incentive problems in th e mortgage loan origination process, \nmuch of which now occurs outside the re gulated banking system.  Mortgage brokers, \nrealtors, and appraisers make money through the volume of transa ctions, but bear little or \nno responsibility for the quality of  the loans that are made.   \nOf course, the same incentive problems fo r borrowers and intermediaries have \nalways been present in bank-based lending.  But, over the years, supervision, regulation, \nand banks’ own risk management and cor porate governance practices have provided \n\n 12\nimportant checks and balances on these in centive problems.  Unfortunately, our new \nmarket-based system of finance does not appe ar to have addressed these incentive issues \nappropriately or in a very robust manner. Policy Challenges\n \n I would like to close my remarks today with a brief look at some of the policy \nissues that have been raised by these recent events.  I will touch briefly on four topics: \nliquidity issues, information and disclo sure, incentive problems, and moral hazard \nconcerns. \nLiquidity issues \n Providing liquidity to the financial syst em in times of stress is, of course, a \nprimary responsibility of central banks.  However, because central bank liquidity \nfacilities are generally directed toward the banking system, it is less clear whether the \ntraditional liquidity facilities are well-positi oned to meet liquidity pressures that emerge \nfrom outside the banking system.  As a cas e in point, the Fede ral Reserve’s Discount \nWindow facility was not used as much as we might  have liked in the recent crisis.  Part of \nthe difficulty was the historical stigma issue that has caused banks to be reluctant to use \nthe window, part was the relatively high price of Discount Window credit, and part was a \nunique feature of the current crisis in which pressures were concentrated in term funding \nrather than overnight funding.  While the Fe deral Reserve made a number of temporary \nmodifications to discount procedures to try to enhance the window’s effectiveness, a \nbroader rethinking of the structur e of lending facilities may be in  order.  As part of this \nexercise, it may be useful to consider whether lending faciliti es should be accessible to a \nbroader range of institutions than  has been the case historically. \n\n 13\n A broader question regarding liquidity is  who should be responsible for providing \nit: institutions or central banks?  In recent years, the U.S. banking system has seen a \ndecline in on-balance-sheet liquidity as banks  have relied more on liability management \nand purchased funds.  The reasons are obvi ous: as markets have grown, they have \nprovided increased liquidity in normal times, a nd the provision of a li quidity buffer that is \nneeded only occasionally by banks is very co stly.  So, as we examine how to improve \ncentral banks’ methods for pr oviding liquidity, perhaps we should also consider whether \nthe banking system should play  a larger role as well. \n The second type of liquidity  issue that I mentioned earlier, market liquidity, is a \nmore complex issue.  I really believe that we need to focus more attention on research \ninto the microstructure of financial mark ets to understand why liquidity pressures \ndevelop and why markets seize up in times of crisis.  Until we have this understanding, \nwe will be forced to deal with these pressures indirectly via the banking system. Disclosure of information \n In much of the commentary on recent events, there has been a considerable \nemphasis on additional disclosure of informati on to help financial market participants \nmake better decisions.  While I have been a long-time advocate of greater disclosure, \nespecially in the banking system, I wonde r whether these concerns are somewhat \nmisplaced.  In this new information age, we have plenty of information.  For many of the more complex structured products that have b een developed in recent  years, it is possible \nto obtain most of the underlying data needed to  analyze the products.  In a sense, the real \nproblem may be that we have so much inform ation that, combined with the complexity of \nthe financial products, investors cannot possi bly make appropriate risk assessments \n\n 14\nwithout relying on other agents.  Even sophistic ated analysts, such as  the rating agencies, \nmay not be able to do a thorough and complete  analysis.  So, I think the information \nproblems go much deeper than suggested  by calls for additional disclosure. \nCorrecting incentive problems  \n In terms of incentives, I think it is impor tant to ask whether markets are likely to \ncorrect some of the problems themselves or wh ether they will need substantial assistance. \nIndeed, there are currently a number of legislative proposals in the U.S. Congress \ndesigned to address some of these problems.  These include greater  standardization of \nmortgage products, licensing and regulation of mortgage lenders, and requirements that \nborrowers have real equity behind their loans.   To be effective, however, some of these \nchanges will require supervision and/or  significant financial penalties. \n  Two more difficult problems involve  the rating agencies and nondepository \nlenders.  Given the importance that ratings pl ay both in the new st ructure of financial \nmarkets and in Basel II, some reform of th e credit-rating system is imperative, but the \nsolution is not obvious.  In the case of nondepository lenders, even though they do not \noperate under explicit safety net protection and bank regulation, their behavior does have \nsystemic implications, and they  may have ties to larger fi nancial organizations that are \nconsidered too big to fail.  While I don’t have  an answer to whether or how they should \nbe regulated, this is an issue that policym akers may have to address in the future. \nMoral hazard issues  \nFinally, with regard to mora l hazard issues, there has b een a lot of talk in the \nfinancial media about the implications of po licymakers’ response to financial crises as \ncreating moral hazard and sowing the seeds for fu ture crises.  I believe that some of this \n\n 15\ntalk is clearly off the mark in the sense that  responsible parties are in many cases bearing \nthe fruit of their bad decisions.  They are not being “bailed out.” \nHowever, there are some deeper issues here  that should give us concern.  First, to \nthe extent that some large, systemically  important institutions  are protected through \nforbearance or temporary relaxati on of regulations, policymakers are making decisions \nabout who will bear the losses.  \nSecond, those of you who are familiar with  the macroeconomics literature are no \ndoubt aware of the relevance of the Lucas Crit ique to these issues.  The Lucas Critique \ninforms us that policymakers must be aware,  and take into account, how their actions \naffect the expectations of market participants.  The reason this point is labeled a \n“critique” is that up to th e mid-1970s, this style of thinking wasn't common among \npolicymakers. Today, we recognize that if pol icymakers change their behavior, market \nparticipants will take this into account and e xpect policymakers to behave similarly in the \nfuture. \nThus, there is no doubt in my mind that fi nancial market participants have taken \nnote of central bank actions and will factor th ese actions into what they expect in the \nfuture.  So, in this sense, we must recognize that actions that seem appropriate in dealing \nwith the current crisis do have future consequences.  One exam ple that I have referred to \nearlier today and on numer ous occasions in the past is “t oo-big-to-fail.”  Another is the \nrecent granting of exemptions between bank a nd financial affiliates  under Section 23A of \nthe Federal Reserve Act.  Please note that I am not being critical of changes that \npolicymakers implement in times of crises.  Indeed, we may find that some temporary \n\n 16\nchanges are very necessary, and perhaps some  should be made permanent.  But such \nactions have consequences.   \nIn a similar macroeconomic vein, I belie ve that to the extent policymakers \nrespond effectively to financial crises, they do alter the behavior of asset prices and \ndefault probabilities.  Since this informa tion serves as the “history” for our asset \nvaluation models, it may become more difficult to use these models effectively in pricing \nsecurities or in conducting risk-s ensitivity simulation exercises. \nConcluding Comments  \n In conclusion, let me acknowledge that  there are many other important issues \nraised by recent events that  are beyond the scope of my comments.  These include how \nthe more widespread implementation of Basel II will change the financial landscape that we operate in and how recent events may cause  us to rethink how we structure capital \nrequirements going forward.  In any event, I be lieve we can rest assured that financial \nmarkets and institutions will continue to evolve  so that we will likely need to reconvene \nat a future date to address a ne w set of important policy issues."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Kansas Bankers Association Annual Meeting \nColorado Springs, Colorado \nAug. 2, 2007 \n \n \n\nIt is a pleasure for me to be here today, and I want to thank you for the opportunity to \nspeak at your annual meeting. \nThe Kansas Bankers Association has played an important role in the history of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dating back quite literally to our Bank’s founding. \nYou may have read about some of this histor y earlier this year in an article published in The \nKansas Banker. \nWhen the Federal Reserve’s founders were determining locations for the nation’s new \nReserve Banks in 1914, the KBA was especially active in promoting Kansas City. Under the \nKBA’s leadership, more than 1,000 Kansas banker s signed cards indica ting their support for \na Bank in Kansas City. It was an impressive and important showing of unity as the entire \nregion came together for a comm on purpose. It was also unique. In many other areas of the \ncountry, bitter local rivalries nearly overwhel med the individuals responsible for determining \nthe locations of the 12 regional Banks. \nThe president of the KBA at that time was an Atchison, Kan. banker named Willis \nBailey. Interestingly, Bailey, who was also a fo rmer Kansas governor, became a member of \nour Bank’s first Board of Director s. He is also one of my early predecessors, serving as the \npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for 10 years starting in 1922.  \nBailey and his work set the stage for a l ong and important relationship between our \norganizations that continues to this day. Over the years, many of you have participated at our \nconferences, economic forums and regulatory up dates. We have also had a supervisory \nrelationship with nearly all of you, at either a bank or a holding company level. Moreover, \nKansas bankers, including some of you, have been important participants on our Board of \nDirectors. \n\nAnd recently, we were pleased when a group fr om the KBA was one of the first to tour \nour new headquarters, which is now under construction. We are extremely happy with \nprogress on the project, and we look forward to next spring when we will have the once-in-a-\ncentury experience of moving into  a new building. We look forwar d to the KBA joining us in \nthose ceremonies. \nToday, I would like to talk about  an issue that is important  to all of us: the Kansas \neconomy, its future, and the potential opportunitie s and risks for Kansas banks. I will be \nmore than happy to take your questions at  the end of my remarks as time allows. \n \nThe economic environment  \n \nOverall, the economy is healthy, with gr owth accelerating to potential while \nunemployment is low. There are, however, a few key concerns of which you are probably \nwell aware. One is residential housing, which might not recover as soon as some have \nexpected, and another, of course, is high energy prices, which could push up prices on other \ngoods and slow consumer spending. \nIn this economic environment, recent banking performance has been very strong. \nROAs have generally been high. Credit qua lity has been good, although slippage is \nbeginning to show in some portfolios.  \nLooking ahead, Kansas bankers face continui ng challenges as the structure of the \nbanking industry and the state economy evolve . As Kansas goes, so goes Kansas banking, \nand so the important questions can be framed  around what opportunity will there be in the \nKansas economy of the future? \n \n \n\nWhat sets the Tenth District and Kansas apart?  \n \nThe industrial structure of the Tenth Fede ral Reserve District, including that of \nKansas, has changed considerably in recent decad es, and it will continue to change in the \nyears ahead. It is vital for Kansas bankers, as they think about the future of their community \nbanks, to be prepared for whatever they encounter.  \nAccording to research by our Bank’s economis ts, a region’s ability to outperform the \nnational economy hinges on the industries that  are unique to that area. These defining \nindustries are what can differentiate, for be tter or worse, a local economy from national \ntrends. Knowing both what these industries ar e and how they are changing is vital for \nrecognizing the opportunities as well as the risks. \nBefore we discuss the industries that most  define the Kansas economy, it is important \nto look at the overall evolving i ndustrial structure, both in Kansas and more broadly in the \nseven states of th e Tenth District. \nTo give an idea of just how much the st ructure of the regional economy has changed \nover a long period: At the time of the 1900 Census , nearly half of all workers in the Tenth \nDistrict were employed in the agriculture and mining sectors. By 2000, that share had \ndropped to less than 5 percent. Manufacturing’ s share of employment in the region has also \nfallen as technological advances make it pos sible for fewer workers to produce greater \namounts of goods.  \nDuring this transformation to a more serv ice-based economy, the industrial structure \nof both Kansas and the entire Tent h District has come to look so mewhat more like the rest of \nthe nation. However, it is important  to note that in even with th is transition, we still remain \ndistinctly different. In a ranking of how closely states mirror the national industrial structure, \n\nKansas is 30th, and other states in the Tenth District are even more unique, including New \nMexico, 43rd, and Oklahoma, 47th. Wyoming was the state most unlike the national economy, \nfinishing 51st in the ranking, which also included the District of Columbia. \nAs you might expect, a few of the Tenth Dist rict’s defining industries, or those that \nmost differentiate our region from the rest of the country, include energy extraction and \nagriculture. Others that play a role include such long-standing  important industries as meat \npacking, aircraft manufacturing, rail tr ansportation and te lecommunications. \nHowever, in various places across the Tent h District, new industries are emerging as \nsignificant. These are industries that have achie ved critical mass, they  pay relatively well and \nthey are expected to continue to grow rapidl y. A few examples from various District states \ninclude software and computer  systems design, medical labora tories and biosciences, and \ndata processing and other high-t ech back-office support services. \nMost of the long-standing defi ning industries for the rest of the Tenth District play the \nsame role in Kansas, and they will likely continue to do so for many years to come. However, \nI believe there are also a couple of emerging industries in the st ate worthy of some attention \ntoday. In order to thrive in the future, Kansas banks need to be aware of what these industries \nare, and what risks and o pportunities they present. \nOne industry that still highly defines Kansas is aircraft  manufacturing—centered in \nWichita. This industry has been hit hard at times  in recent decades with defense cutbacks, as \nwell as the overall difficulties  of the airline industry follo wing 9/11. But the industry has \nperformed well of late—aircraft manufacturing employment in Ka nsas is up 6 percent from a \nyear ago—and the outlook is generally positive.  Increases in demand for defense aerospace \n\nproduction the past few years and an improving tr end in demand for civilian aircraft have \ncreated solid job growth.  \nAnd demand for personal air travel in general is likely to rise relative to other forms of \ntransportation heading forward, as real income s rise. This should be a boon for Wichita’s \ncivilian aircraft makers, as well as their many suppliers and employees in the years to come, \nproviding some opportunities for Kansas bankers . The industry will likely remain relatively \nvolatile, though, presenting so me lending risks as well. \nAnother highly defining industry in the st ate is wired telecommunications providers, \ncentered primarily at the Sprint Campus in  Johnson County but distributed in many ways \nacross the state. Wired telecoms were victims of the high-tech bust of  this decade, brought on \nby considerable overinvestment during the 1990s . While performance has improved slightly \nin the past couple of years and some opport unities exist as high-sp eed wired telecom access \nreaches more homes, employment remains well below pre-2001 recession levels, and many \nanalysts project the outlook for wired telecoms to not be as solid as for wireless, cable and \nsatellite telecommunications. Industry cons olidation and strong price competition are \nexpected to decrease telecom employment as well. But telecommunications in general will \nremain important to Kansas bankers, both as they  make sure their own bank is up-to-speed on \nthe latest capabilities and as they watch the extent to which the important telecom \ninfrastructure and expertise located in Kansas can adjust to changing trends in the industry. \nIn addition to aircraft and telecoms, another industry that remains fundamentally \nimportant throughout the state is, of course, ag riculture, in all facets of the industry. This \nincludes input supply and processing; farming and ranching; and, increasingly, biofuels. In \ngeneral, employment growth in agriculture-relat ed industries is anticipated to be sluggish \n\nheading forward as farming t echnologies and productivity con tinue to advance, although the \nrecent success of biofuels may provide some boo st. While risks exist regarding the long-term \nviability of ethanol as an economic driver, the adaptation of traditional agricultural methods \nand expertise to new products and services may continue to present opportunities in many \nparts of Kansas and thus be opportunities for Kansas banks to grow and expand as well. \nThese might include other types of alternativ e energy, other high-valu e-added products, agri-\ntourism and the like. \nWhile aircraft manufacturing, telecommunicatio ns and agriculture will, in one way or \nanother, continue to largely define and drive the Kansas economy in the years ahead, there \nalso are a couple of other industries emerging as significant in the state. Though, as with the \nstate’s long-standing defining indu stries, there are risks to re lying too heavily and focusing \ntoo much attention on specific industries, these industries could serve as  potential anchors for \nfuture economic growth in some areas. As such, their recent developments and trends need to \nbe on the radar screens of Kansas bankers. \nThe first is biosciences, including ag product-related research a nd development, as \nwell as R&D related to human health, food and pharmaceuticals and animal health. As \nrecently at 1990, this industry had very little pr esence in Kansas relative to the country as a \nwhole. But by 2005, it was more than twice as c oncentrated here as in the nation. It now \nemploys thousands and has begun to blossom in several places around the state. Although it \nhas been prominently located in Johnson County, where synergies with the Stowers Institute \nin Kansas City, Mo., are possible, activity has also emerged in or near most of the state’s larger university towns—including Lawr ence, Manhattan, Wichita and Hays. The \nbiosciences industry pays quite well (avera ge earnings of $48,000 in 2005), and the outlook \n\nheading forward is generally bright. While activ ity is likely to continue to center around \ncollege towns or areas with la rge research institu tions, the economic wealth created could \nbenefit many banks throughout the state.  \nIn addition to biosciences, a second important  emerging industry in Kansas is what is \ntermed office administrative services, and includ es relatively high-tech  back-office logistics, \npayroll, and other types of management suppor t and consulting services. Like biosciences, \nthis industry is now more than  twice as concentrated in Kans as as in the nation, and it pays \nrelatively well (also ~$48,000). A lthough it is also currently lo cated primarily in Johnson \nCounty, with advancing Internet  technology, portions of this work could potentially be \nperformed in more remote areas looking for new sources of job growth. A key will be \nmaking sure these Kansas communities have ac cess to the right kinds of telecommunications \ninfrastructure, as well as well-ed ucated workers, a necessity for economic growth in general. \n \nSummary  \nTo summarize, the Kansas economy, like the national economy and the economy of \nthe Tenth Federal Reserve District, has changed considerably over time and will continue to change, both within its traditional industries and in new defining industries. While trends in aircraft manufacturing, telecommunications and agriculture will continue  to play a sizable \nrole in the fate of the Kansas economy head ing forward, new industries such as biosciences \nand back-office high-tech work may present so lid opportunities for communities across the \nstate. Kansas bankers can thrive in this chan ging economic environment, but in order to do \nso, they need to be aware of trends in each  of these industries and recognize the unique \nopportunities and risks they  present for the state."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n  \n \n               \nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association Annual Convention \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma \nJune 12, 2007 \n \n\n 2\n \nIt is a real pleasure for me to be here , and I want to thank you for the opportunity. \nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nhave an important relationship.  Banks provide a key link in the implementation of monetary \npolicy, and our relationship with  the OBA is an important co mponent in carrying out our \nresponsibilities for the macroeconomy and for financial stability. The connections between \nour organizations extend into other areas as well, ranging from the cr edit available through \nour discount window to the work of our bank exam iners to our role in the payments system. \nWe know each other well and have for years. \nWhen times are good, as they are now, we mi ght tend to take our strong connection for \ngranted.  Today I’d like to reflect on our l ong working relationship:  how it has worked \nduring stressful times in the past and its importance for the future. I will also outline several banking issues we should be aware of even as we enjoy today’s very positive banking \nenvironment. Finally, I will briefly discuss the current banking conditions in Oklahoma. \n \nThe Oklahoma Bankers Association and th e Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n \nFrom their beginnings, both the Oklahoma Bankers Association and the Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City have had a strong interest in serving th eir membership and the \npublic.  The OBA had its start in June 1897 – 110 years ago this month – 10 years before \nOklahoma became a state.  The Federal Rese rve Bank of Kansas City opened in 1914 and \nour Oklahoma City Branch  had its start in 1920. \nThere are many things I can mention in term s of a very positive relationship between \nOklahoma bankers and the Federal Reserve.  Many of you have participated at our \nconferences, economic forums and regulatory up dates.  We have also had a supervisory \n\n 3\nrelationship with nearly all of you, at either a bank or a holding company level.  Moreover, \nOklahoma bankers, including some of you, have b een important participants on our board of \ndirectors in Kansas City and at our Oklahoma City Branch. \nOklahoma bankers, the OBA and Oklahoma legisl ators have also been very active in \nstate and national legislative issues, including many key pieces of legislation affecting the \nFederal Reserve.   \nIn discussing the Federal Reserve’s conn ection to Oklahoma, I should mention first \nand foremost that the person who was responsible for writing much of the original Federal Reserve Act was Robert Owen of Oklahoma, ch airman of the Senate Banking Committee.  \nWithout his efforts, and those of several other key legislators from the Midwest, it is unlikely \nthat the Federal Reserve Act would have been  passed in 1913 and that we would have the \ntype of central bank that we have today. \nOn a more personal level, I would also lik e to mention my long personal relationship \nwith Roger Beverage and Mick Thompson.  They  have been extremely helpful in providing \nme with their insights on Okla homa banking and have been great to work with on a variety of \nbanking issues of importance to Oklahoma and our region. \n The Federal Reserve’s Invol vement in Supervision \n \nThe Federal Reserve derives many benefits  from our connection with each of you.  \nOur Oklahoma City Branch office gains insi ght on the regional economy by staying in \ncontact with bankers and lo cal business leaders. We al so place great importance on \nmaintaining our relationships through our  role in supervision and payments. \n\n 4\nIn the area of supervision, Federal Re serve Governor Don Kohn described the \nimportance of this connection in a recent speech, saying, “The Federal Reserve’s activities as \na bank supervisor provide us with important a nd sometimes critical information, expertise, \ncredibility and powers to both dete r and manage financial crises.” \nFrom a personal and a very practical perspe ctive, this supervisory experience and the \nresulting relationships with banke rs on a regional level proved to be extremely helpful to me \nand others at our Bank during th e energy, real estate and agri cultural collapses in the 1980s. \nThis was particularly true in Oklahoma as  energy prices dropped dramatically.  We \nrelied extensively on the firsthand knowledge gained through our supe rvisory responsibilities \nof major Oklahoma banking organizations.  This  knowledge provided us with an in-depth \nview into the Oklahoma economy an d financial system – insight that proved to be of great \nimportance when our Bank was called upon to gi ve its views on macroeconomic policy and \nto take steps to help maintain a stable financial system.   \nWhile much of the rest of the country was still experienci ng “boom-like” economic \nconditions, we were among the fi rst regions to sound the alarm that the economy was not as \nstrong as some thought. \nIn one instance – the failure of Penn Square Bank here in Oklahoma City – we were all \nreminded that a seemingly small organization can have a substantia l impact on the entire \nbanking system and that actions on a regiona l level can have important implications \nnationwide.  Prior to its failure , Penn Square Bank had sold loan participations to eight of the \n50 largest banks in the country.  These participations served as the initial impetus in the \nfailure of Continental Illinoi s National Bank in 1984, which wa s one of the 10 largest U.S. \n\n 5\nbanks, and in Bank of America’s acquisition of  Seattle First National Bank under a special \nWashington state failing-bank law. \nMany of the steps taken in Oklahoma in the 1980s also benefited from a close \nrelationship among the Federal Reserve, the Oklahoma Banking Department, the FDIC, the \nOCC and individual bankers in Oklahoma.  This  was a very stressful time for everyone, and \none of my strong memories from that time was the effort by John Kirkpa trick to save Liberty \nNational Bank and keep it under lo cal ownership.  The commitme nt of John and a number of \nothers helped Liberty become one of only tw o major banks in Oklahoma and Texas not to \nfail or need FDIC assistance dur ing the 1980s.  Such efforts were  of critical importance in \nterms of providing a starting point for tu rning around the Oklahoma economy, maintaining \nfunding for many businesses here and encouraging investment in other banks, such as George \nKaiser’s willingness to support Bank of Okla homa.  These relationships and experience \nfurther made it clear to me that banking in th e United States is best  understood and nurtured \nat a regional level.   \n The Changing Banking Landscape and Financial Competition\n \nSince the 1980s, the banking landscape has ch anged quite dramatica lly, and all of you \nnow face a much different competitive environmen t.  In this new environment, I would like \nto think the relationship to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is as important and solid \nas ever. \nThere has been a significan t trend toward consolidation.  The number of banks \nnationwide, and in Oklahoma, has declined to about half the 1980 level.  During this same \ntime period, the 10 largest banking or ganizations in the United Stat es increased their share of \n\n 6\ndomestic banking deposits from about 19 percent to  more than 44 percent.  Interstate banking \nhas also been an important factor in these cons olidation trends, with ba nking organizations as \na group now holding nearly the same amount of de posits in other states as they hold within \ntheir home states.  In Oklahoma, 27 percen t of deposits are held by organizations \nheadquartered outside of the state. \nWhile there may be fewer banks in Okla homa, many of you are competing against \nlarger institutions, including a notable num ber headquartered outside of Oklahoma.  \nMoreover, the total number of banking offices – main offices and branches combined – has \nrisen since 1980 by about two-thir ds nationwide and somewhat mo re than that in Oklahoma. \nCompeting institutions have wider footprints in your markets.  As a result, structural changes in banking, along with several othe r factors I’ll discuss next, ar e leading to a more intensely \ncompetitive environment – one that differs greatly from that of just a decade or two before.      \nOn the lending side, a wide variety of fact ors are leading to more competitive credit \nmarkets.  Financial information on borrowers is  more readily available and at a much lower \ncost – both to bankers and to a wide range of nonbank lenders.  At the same time, the cost of \nprocessing this loan data and making a loan ha s declined significantly, particularly with the \nadvent of credit scoring, automated underw riting systems and other data processing \nadvances.  Loan customers can even be soli cited over the internet, and funds are often \nextended with little or no personal contact. \nSecuritization is further bri nging new investors into the marketplace, sometimes from \nall over the world, and increasing the volume of  funds flowing into credit markets.  \nSecuritization is also creating lenders who are largely originat ors and hold very few loans on \ntheir books at any time.  In addi tion, new financial instruments, su ch as credit derivatives, are \n\n 7\nallowing credit risk to be transferred to other parties – ideally, to thos e who are in the best \nposition to bear such risks. \nAn outgrowth of all these developments is  an enormous expansion in the types of \nlenders and investors that serv e credit markets, and, in turn, the creation of a much more \ncompetitive lending marketplace.  These trends  have further brought down risk premiums, \nand the spread between high-yield or junk bonds and U.S. Treasury securities has now \ndropped to near historic lows. \nOn the deposit side, a rising interest rate en vironment has meant a higher cost of funds \nfor banks.  Further adding to these funding costs is increased deposit competition.  The \ninternet is greatly expanding the choices that depositors have for placing their money.  Local \nbankers are also facing increasing competition from other sources.  Many large banks, for example, have rediscovered the benefits of  retail banking and a broader office network, \nparticularly as competition drives down profitabi lity in their other business lines.  In addition, \na rising stock market and improving returns on other investments are now encouraging \ndepositors to move more funds into nonbank investment options. \nAs all of you are aware, these trends ar e driving up the cost of bank funding and \nbeginning to put pressure on bank ne t interest margins.  During the past few years, increased \nreal estate and business lending have helped  Oklahoma banks to maintain or increase \nprofitability in this more competitive environm ent and period of declining risk spreads.  \nHowever, there are obvious limits to how far th is strategy can be ta ken without adversely \naffecting a bank’s risk exposure and potential lo an losses.  Thus, for all of you as Oklahoma \nbankers, an important question is, “How far can you go in this new environment and still \nmaintain profitable and safe banking operations?” \n\n 8\n \nRisks and Responsibilities  \nThe current performance of Oklahoma banks  indicates that many of you are meeting \nthe challenges of this changi ng landscape.  Net income for Oklahoma banks has been at or \nnear record levels for the past few years.  In fact, the average ROAA for Oklahoma banks \nwas 1.4 percent in 2006, which may very well be the highest ever achie ved in this state. \nOther measures of banking performance, su ch as loan growth, interest margins, \ncapital, nonperforming assets and loan losses have also remained at very favorable levels. \nBased on this performance, it would app ear that a challenge many of you face as \nOklahoma bankers is not to become complacent a nd lose sight of the risks that are always \ninherent in your operations. \nIn this regard, I recently gave a speech tit led, “This Time It’s Different (Or Is It?).” \nThe idea behind this speech was that some ba nkers are now telling us, as well as their \ndirectors and stockholders, not to worry  about their current strategies.  \nPart of their reasoning is that the market place has changed and that we are more \ncapable of measuring and controlling risk expo sures.  Many also suggest that the United \nStates economy has become much more stable , as based on our recent experience with \nseveral of the longest expans ions on record and very mild  recessions in between.   \nIn some ways, though, this combination of great optimism, record bank earnings and \ndeclining risk spreads mirrors what we saw here in Oklahoma during the energy boom of the \n1970s and early 1980s.  Back the n, many Oklahoma bankers saw little reason to worry about \nrisk spreads since the price of oil could only go up.   \nAnd indeed it did – for a while.  \n\n 9\nFrom $2.75 a barrel in 1973, oil prices rose to a peak of  nearly $37 in 1981 before \ndropping all the way down to $10 in 1986.  Th e optimism and rapid upward trend in oil \nprices made energy lending the hottest ticket in  banking back then and ultimately contributed \nto previously mentioned collapses of Penn Squa re Bank, Continental Illinois and Sea-First. \nFor most of you, this is hardly new inform ation.  My point in drawing this quick \ncomparison is not that I think we will repeat wh at happened then, but I be lieve we need to be \na little careful at this point in the business and credit cycle.  In my previous speech on this \ntopic, I gave a number of examples of banke rs in the 1970s and 1980s who thought they were \nfollowing “foolproof” strategies only to find there was something they should have been \nmuch more skeptical about.  Even tually, some of today’s strategi es will be tested under more \nstressful circumstances – subprime lending is a current example – and we will then find out \nhow “foolproof” such strategies might be. \n \nSummary  \nOne key to success for bankers is to be will ing to ask the difficult questions about your \nbank’s operations and strategies:  Is there anything that you shoul d be more skeptical about?  \nThese are the kinds of questions that bankers  and central bankers should be asking as we \nmanage the present and prepare for the future. N one of us can predict the future, my 30 years \nin banking and economics taught me that, bu t we can prepare for its uncertainty. \nI would assert that each of  you is in the best position of anyone in the financial \nmarketplace to play this role, given your cl ose customer relationships and the detailed \nknowledge and experience gained th rough your daily banking operations. \n   \n\n 10\nFinally, to come full circle, I suggest that  the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nand the Oklahoma Bankers must continue to  pursue the common objectives of sound banking \nand a sound economy.  Our staff are observing best , and worst, practices.  We can provide \ninsight and help strengthen banking in Okla homa. As Oklahoma bankers, you can greatly \nhelp the Federal Reserve as well, by sharing with us your valuable knowledge and personal \ninsights on the Oklahoma banking industry and the economy. \nI look forward to hearing your thoughts on the current banking environment and to \ncontinue our banking and supervisory relationships. \n###"

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n              \n \n \nCody, Wyoming \nJune 6, 2007 \n \n\n 2\n \n I am pleased to be in Cody today to sp eak with you about the prospects for the \nU.S. economy in the period ahead.  As you know, the U.S. economy has been through a difficult period over the past year, with slower  economic growth and higher inflation.  I \nam optimistic, however, that economic condi tions will improve in coming months.  \nIndeed, as the year progresses,  I expect to see a notable pi ckup in economic growth, and I \nam hopeful that we will also see lower infl ation.  Realistically, though, there are some \nimportant risks to both outlook and inflation, an d the path for monetary policy this year \nwill depend importantly on how these risks play out. \nMoving beyond the near-term outlook, I would also like to discuss some \nsignificant challenges the U.S. economy will face over the longer term.  In recent years, \nthe U.S. economy has performed very well,  with strong growth in employment and \noutput coupled with low interest  rates and inflation.  However,  the future may not be as \nrosy.  Indeed, ongoing demographic changes co mbined with slower productivity growth \ncould lead to a reduction in the economy’ s potential growth rate and make it more \ndifficult to continue to increase our living st andards.  These changes will pose important \nchallenges for policymakers during the next several decades. \nLet me begin with a closer look at re cent economic conditions and the near-term \noutlook and then provide some perspectiv es on these longer term economic issues. \nRecent economic conditions\n \n During the past four quarters, the U. S. economy slowed considerably, with \ngrowth in real gross domestic product averagi ng less than 2 percent.  This is well below \nthe economy’s estimated potential growth rate  of around 3 percent.  At the same time, \ninflation moved higher.  Overall CPI infla tion, measured on a 12-month basis, rose to \n\n 3\nmore than 4 percent last summer before declin ing somewhat last fall.  Core CPI, which \nremoves volatile food and energy prices, wa s close to 3 percent last summer and \ncurrently remains at 2.3 percent.  The slowdown in growth resulted prim arily from weaker investment spending, \nboth residential construction and, more re cently, business investment spending.  The \nslump in housing, by itself, reduced GDP growth  by a full percentage point over the past \nfour quarters.  Indeed, absent the housi ng slowdown, the economy would have grown \nvery near potential last year.   \nThe weakness in business investment sp ending resulted from several sources.  \nSome of the weakness in housing activity sp illed over into busine ss investment spending \nin industries that supply the housing market.  In addition, declining auto sales, caused by \nhigher energy prices, led to cutbacks in auto production and inventories.  Business \nspending on new plant and equipment weakened as  well, for reasons that are not entirely \nclear, but may reflect the gene ral slowing in economic activity. \n Although there has been consid erable talk in the media in recent months about the \npossibility of recession, such talk ignores so me of the fundamental underlying strengths \nin the economy.  In particular, even t hough investment has been weak, consumer \nspending, government spending, and exports ha ve remained strong and have cushioned \nthe effects of weaker investment.  Indee d, despite the slowdown in GDP growth, we \ncontinue to see solid job gains, a nd unemployment remains very low.  \n When we look more closely at the recent behavior of inflation, we see two main \nfactors.  First, higher energy prices last  spring pushed up overall CPI inflation, and may \nhave spilled over into core inflation as well.  When energy prices declined last fall, we \n\n 4\nsaw considerable improvement in overall  CPI inflation and a somewhat smaller \nimprovement in core inflation.  The second key factor affecting infla tion last year was a \nlarge increase in the cost  of homeownership, which was caused by the housing boom \nduring the past few years.  After rising shar ply last spring, increa ses in homeownership \ncosts have moderated, contributing to the slowing in inflation in recent months. \nThe near-term outlook  \n  Turning to the near-term outlook, most fo recasters see a pickup in growth for the \nbalance of this year and some  moderation in core inflation.  I share this outlook.  Indeed, \nI believe growth is likely to average 2.5 percen t to 3 percent over the balance of this year \nand turn in a similar performance next year.   \nThis improvement comes from several sources, including: solid consumer \nspending, strong export growth and government  spending, higher business inventory and \nfixed investment, and a diminishing drag from  residential construction.  Because growth \nis likely to remain below the economy’s potential growth rate, however, we may see \nunemployment rise somewhat by year-end.  I al so believe that we will see some gradual \nimprovement in core inflation, especially as homeownership costs continue to moderate. \nRealistically, however, there are some important risks to the outlook, and the \nanticipated pickup in growth may be delaye d.  Growth may not rebound quickly if the \nhousing slump turns out to be deeper or more prolonged than expected.  As you know, \nmuch of the recent weakness in housing market s is due to the contraction in subprime \nlending.  Many of the new home loans made in  recent years were to borrowers who did \nnot qualify for conventional mortgage financ ing.  And, a large numbe r of these loans had \nfeatures, such as low teaser rates, short ad justment periods and interest-only payments, \n\n 5\nthat made them vulnerable in a higher interest rate environment.  Indeed, a rise in short-\nterm interest rates and reduced home price appreciation have made it difficult for some \nsubprime borrowers to continue to make mort gage payments or refinance their mortgage, \nleading to a rise in delinquencie s and increased foreclosures.   \nThese developments have caused highly publicized difficulties for some lenders \nspecializing in subprime lending and have resulted in some ti ghtening of credit terms in \nthe subprime sector.  Moreover, in the past fe w weeks, we have also seen some upward \npressure on conventional mortgage rates, which may put additional pressure on housing \nmarkets.  Most forecasters believe it will be several more months before conditions \nstabilize and even longer before we see a housing recovery.   \n Another risk is that consumer spending may turn out weaker than anticipated.  \nConsumer spending has been the primary engine of growth during the pa st several years.  \nHowever, many consumers have been sp ending beyond their incomes by tapping into \nhome equity.  With lower hous e price appreciation, this spen ding stimulus may diminish.  \nWe have also seen somewhat weaker employ ment growth and retail spending in the past \nfew months, which may be a harbinger of weaker consumer spending going forward.  \nThe recent uptick in energy prices may contribut e to slower spending as well, especially \nfor autos. \nA third risk is that business investme nt spending may remain sluggish.  Weak \ninvestment spending would not onl y result in lower economic gr owth in the near term but \ncould also reduce growth in productive capacity, leading to lower potential growth and \nhigher inflationary pressures over the long te rm.  I will have more to say about the \nconnections among investment, productiv ity and growth in a few minutes. \n\n 6\nNot all of the growth risks are on the downside, however.  Growth could be \nstronger than expected due to stronger exports  and greater fiscal s timulus.  Export growth \nwill benefit from the weaker dollar during th e past several years as well as stronger \neconomic growth abroad.  In fact, much of  the recent improvement in manufacturing \nactivity, both in the Tenth Di strict and nationally, is being driven by stronger export \norders.  There is also likely to be significant fiscal stim ulus coming from the improved \nbudget situation of state and local governments as well as  continued strong defense \nspending. \nThere are also risks that inflation may not moderate as expected.  Recently, we \nhave seen renewed strength in energy pr ices, which may pass th rough temporarily into \ncore inflation.  In addition, there may be a dditional cost pressures coming from tight \nlabor markets, rising commodity input prices an d the lower dollar.  Of special concern is \nthe recent slowdown in labor productivity, which,  if it continues, woul d lead to additional \ncost pressures in the future. \nAs to monetary policy in the period ahead, the Federal Reserve faces some \ndifficult decisions in balancing the risk of weaker growth agains t the risk of higher \ninflation.  In my judgment, th e current stance of policy, with a federal funds rate at 5 ¼ \npercent reflects an appropriate balancing of  these opposing risks.  I believe that the \ncurrent policy stance is somewhat restrictive and, if maintained, will bring core inflation \nback to acceptable levels ove r time.  While I can envision a set of circumstances in which \nthe funds rate is lowered, I can just as easily see circumstances in which policy might \nneed to be tightened further.  Consequently, any future change in the stance of policy will \nlikely depend on the evolution of the economy in the coming months. \n\n 7\nLonger term growth and m onetary policy challenges  \nIn my remaining time here, I would like to shift from a discussion of the near-\nterm economic outlook to examine the longer ru n growth prospects for the U.S. economy.  \nSpecifically, I would like to focus on some of  the important factors that will determine \nour potential rate of growth in coming decades  and the challenges they pose for monetary \npolicy.  Economists define potential output as the output that an economy can produce \nwith fully employed resources and with low an d stable inflation.  The growth in potential \noutput is a key determinant of how fast our living standards improve over time.  \nCurrently, many economists believe that the po tential growth rate of the U.S. economy \ncould slow over the next decade from current  estimates of around 3 percent to 2 to 2 ½ \npercent.  I would like to examine why this might happen and some of the difficulties this could create. \nGrowth in potential output stems from two main sources: growth in the labor \nforce and growth in the productivity or th e amount of output than can be produced per \nworker.  Labor force growth depends mainly on demographic factors such as the size of \nthe working age population.  Productivity growth depends on amounts of capital \nequipment, technology, and the education and sk ills of the labor force.  Forecasts of \nslower growth in potential output are based primarily on estimates of a sizable slowdown \nin labor force growth and pa rtly on estimates of declini ng productivity gr owth over the \nnext several years.  To see what lies behind these projections, let me take a closer look at \nthese two factors. \n \n\n 8\nLabor force growth  \n The projected slowing of labor force grow th is largely based on the anticipated \nretirement of baby boomers over the next decade.   It also reflects a continuation of the \nlower labor force participati on rates of younger age groups in  recent years.  As you know, \npopulation aging is not unique to the United St ates.  Most industrialized countries and \neven some developing countries, such as Ch ina, will experience rapid population aging \nand lower labor force growth in coming decades.  Three factors might mitigate the expected slowing of the labor force.  One possibility is that many workers may postpone retirement.  In fact, we have seen some signs of increasing labor force participation rates for older ag e groups in recent years.  In \naddition, increased shortages of labor c ould lead to rising wages and increased \nparticipation rates for those not currently in the labor force.   \nHowever, the largest factor is likely to be  the role that immigration plays in labor \nforce growth.  Immigration has been an increas ingly important part of the labor force in \nrecent years and potentially could make up a si gnificant portion of the expected shortfall \nin labor force due to population aging.  Howe ver, recent immigrants have generally had \nless education and job skills than the overall labor force and so would need significant \nimprovement in these areas to be as productive as other workers. \nProductivity trends  \n While some slowing of labor force growth is inevitable, the outlook for \nproductivity growth is much less certain.  As we look back over the past several decades, we see both periods of strong productivity growth and periods of weak productivity \ngrowth.  During the 1960s and early 1970s, for example, growth of output per hour in the \n\n 9\nnonfarm business sector averaged a strong 2.8 pe rcent.  Then, from the mid-1970s to the \nmid-1990s, productivity growth dropped by half  to only 1.4 percent.  Corresponding to \nthis slowdown in productivity growth was a sign ificant slowing in the growth of potential \noutput to around 2 percent to 2 ¼ percent.  Beginning in the mid-1990s and cont inuing to 2004, however, productivity \ngrowth rebounded to around 2.9 percent, and es timates of potential growth increased to 3 \nto 3 ½ percent.  Economists have attributed mu ch of this surge in productivity to business \ninvestments in information a nd telecommunications technology. \nMore recently, we have once again experi enced much lower productivity growth.  \nSince 2005, productivity growth has averaged only  1.8 percent.  It is this recent slowing \nthat is starting to concern policymakers beca use, if it continues, it could exacerbate the \nreduction in potential out put growth coming from sl ower labor force growth. \nAs I noted earlier, productivity growth is closely tied to factors such as the \namounts and types of capital workers use as well as the skills that workers apply to their \njobs.  Worker skills, of course, depend on education and on-the-job training.  The \nquantity of capital goods and the technology incorporated in those goods depends \nprimarily on research and development and investment decisions made by firms.  The \nrecent weakness in business investment spending that I discussed earlier is potentially worrisome because it could exacerbate the r ecent productivity slowdown and so lead to \nslower growth in potential  output over the longer run. \nChallenges for monetary policy  \n Let me conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of these developments \nfor monetary policy.  To begin, it is importa nt to recognize what monetary policy can and \n\n 10\ncannot do with regard to growth in potentia l output.  Monetary policy can play a major \nrole in assuring that the economy operates close to its potentia l.  For example, the Federal \nReserve can push interest rates up to head o ff inflationary pressures when the economy is \noperating above potential.  And, the Fed can push rates down to provide economic \nstimulus when the economy is operating below its potential.   \nTo be effective in stabilizing the ec onomy, however, policymakers must have a \nreasonably accurate measure of the econom y’s potential growth.  Without this \ninformation, there is the risk that policy coul d be unnecessarily tight if potential growth is \nunderestimated or too inflationa ry if potential growth is overestimated.  In fact, some \neconomists attribute the surge in inflation during the 1970s to polic ymakers’ failure to \nrecognize the slowdown in produc tivity growth and potential growth that I discussed \nearlier.  Consequently, the be havior of productivity and poten tial growth over the next \nfew years could have important implications for monetary policy. \nFinally, it is important to recognize that while monetary policy can help provide \nshort-run economic stability, it cannot affect the rate of potential out put growth directly. \nAs we have seen, the economy’s potential gr owth rate depends mainly on demographic \nfactors and productivity.  Monetary policy ca n influence potential growth indirectly by \nproviding a stable, noninflationary  economic environment.  Su ch an environment reduces \nuncertainty about the economic outlook.  In doing so, it provides a more favorable \nframework for households to pl an their lifetime savings a nd spending decisions and for \nbusinesses to make long-term investment deci sions.  And, as businesses are encouraged \nto pursue research and development and introduce new technology, productivity and \npotential growth increase.  Thus, by providi ng an environment of economic stability and \n\n 11\nprice stability in the short run, monetary pol icy can contribute to the economy’s potential \ngrowth in the longer term. \n###"

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBasel Capital Standards:   \nImplementation and Challenge \nSSI Program \nCape Town, South Africa \nFebruary 5, 2007 \n \n\nIt is a pleasure to be  here with you today.  \nWe are in a period of revolutionary change in the financial indus try that is greatly \ninfluencing the way banks and fi nancial institutions operate.  \nThe financial industry is becoming much more diverse. In the United States, for instance, \nsome banks—typically smaller banks—continue to specialize in traditional deposit and loan \nactivities. Others—usually larger banking organi zations—now engage in a far more complex set \nof financial services, includi ng trading, clearing, and other securities and capital markets \nactivities. Many of these activities are further conducted on a global basi s. I imagine there are \nsimilar differences in the financial industries of many African nations where the branches of very \nlarge foreign banks are operating in the same markets as local banks.     \nThis growing diversity among fi nancial institutions, combined  with rapid technological \ninnovation and financial deregulation, is ha ving a profound effect on the regulatory and \nsupervisory framework. A key question for us, as  bank supervisors, is how can we respond to \nthese changes in a manner that ensures a sa fe and sound banking system without undermining \nthe industry’s ability to innovate.  \nBanking supervisors worldwide are having to  move toward a more risk-focused \nsupervisory framework that looks  at the effectiveness of the risk management process. In \naddition, supervisors are grappling with the issue of how they can  best tailor regulations to a \ndiverse group of institutions without giving a competitive advantage or imposing regulatory \nburdens unevenly. An important example of such a challenge is the Basel II Capital Standards \nand the approaches that countries are now taking to implement it.  \nMy goal here is to make you aware of importa nt elements of the Basel II implementation \nin the United States. As part of this I’ll describe vari ous related steps we ar e taking to establish a \n 1\n\nworkable capital framework for banks that do not engage in significant international or \nnontraditional activities. To give you the broadest understanding of our process, it will be helpful \nto review how our financial system and its supervision have changed in recent years. These \nchanges have led to greater diversity among indi vidual institutions and a transition to a more \nrisk-based supervisory framework.  \nBasel II, to be successful, requires a good risk-based capital program. To be fully \nsuccessful, it must also rely on strong supervisio n and market discipline—as reflected in part by \nPillars 2 and 3 of the Basel framework. It is th e combination of capital standards, supervisory \noversight and public disclosure that will allow a risk-based capital and supervisory program to \nsucceed.  \n \nFinancial market developments in recent years \n \n \nThe world is experiencing a rapid evolution of its financial mark ets. Innovations in \ntechnology and finance have greatly lowered th e cost of financial transactions, while \ndramatically increasing global communicat ion and access to financial information.  \nThe implications are enormous. Banks no l onger operate within a segmented financial \nsystem, which had previously limited competition among banks, thrifts, credit unions, securities firms, insurance companies and the capital market s. As a result, each of these industries is \nexpanding, causing banks and other financial in stitutions to face new and growing competition.  \nMeanwhile, lower costs for information, transa ctions and data processing have combined \nwith applied financial theory to open the door to new and complex financial instruments and \nbetter ways to manage risk. Examples include derivatives, securitized assets, and new risk \nmanagement models and systems. For banks—par ticularly larger banks—these changes have \n 2\n\nmeant less need to hold and fund assets on their own balance sheets, a more accurate means for \nmeasuring and managing risk exposures, and new ways of lending, using such tools such as \ncredit scoring and the internet. These same developments are further enabling capital and \nfinancial markets to fulfill some of the same role s as banks in funding the credit and investments \nneeds of households and businesses. \nA final effect of technological  innovation is to make financ ial intermediati on more of a \nglobal activity. With lower communication and information costs, banks can extend their \ninternational financial activities and follow indivi dual firms as their business needs become more \nglobal in scope.  \n \nResulting changes in the supervisory and regulatory system \n \n \nIn the United States, significant changes in  the supervisory and regulatory system have \nbeen required to keep up with these marketplace  developments. Previous regulatory restrictions, \nsuch as deposit interest ceil ings, limits on permissible banking activities and constraints on \ngeographical expansion, have pr oven unworkable or ill-advised in this changing financial \nenvironment. As a result, substantial deregul ation has occurred. Banks and other financial \ninstitutions now have much grea ter latitude in deciding what pr oducts they can offer, how they \nprice them and how they can expand their business. \nFor U.S. banking supervisors, these change s mean less reliance is placed on rules and \nrestrictions in ensuring a safe and sound banking system. For larger banks that are heavily \ninvolved in transactional activ ities through their tr ading, clearing and derivatives operations, \nsupervisory review of current balance sheet pos itions provides only limited insight into a bank’s \nrisk exposure.  In response to this changing banking environment, supervisors are developing a \n 3\n\nmore risk-focused supervisory framework. Th ey are giving greater emphasis to the unique \ncharacteristics of each bank and to the processes,  management information systems and internal \ncontrols that a bank has in place to manage and control its risk exposure.  \nA second implication of this financial revoluti on is that supervisors must interact with a \nmuch more diverse group of banks. Although a ll banks have seen technology and financial \ninnovation greatly change their operations, the mo re significant change s are occurring at the \nlarger U.S. banking organizations. Examples in clude the development of complex financial \ninstruments; entry into securities, insurance, trading and other capital markets activities; more \nsophisticated risk management practices; and expa nsion of global financial activities. The wider \nrange of products being offered by financial inst itutions and the merging of banking, securities \nand insurance activities is also leading to th e growing importance of large bank and financial \nholding companies. This development is shifting mo re risk management practices to the parent \ncompany level and thereby increasing the importance of consolidated supervision. \nThe growing diversity among financial institutions requires regulators to take a \nmultifaceted approach to supervision and regulat ion by designing provisions that reflect the \nunderlying risks and are either limited in their co verage or apply only to  a particular group of \nbanks. Examples of targeted supervision in the United States include examination frequencies, \nbank holding company inspections, internal audit standards and the Basel capital requirements \nthemselves.  \n \nThe role of Basel II in this environment \n \n \nFor bankers, investors and regulators, a critical step in this new environment is to bring a \nbank’s capital into a closer relationship with its risk exposure. Since its ad option, the Basel I \n 4\n\nframework has helped to provide some fairly br oad adjustments in capital standards for credit \nrisk and, more recently, market risk. However, the Basel I risk weights fail to address significant \ndifferences in the quality of individual assets  and off-balance-sheet exposures. Consequently, \nbanks have been required to put the same amoun t of capital behind their hi ghest and their lowest \nquality loans—a feature of Basel I that makes it costly to keep better assets on the balance sheet and provides incentives to arbitrage this capital framework. \nComplex financial instruments also have made the simpler Basel I standards more \ndifficult to implement. Basel I, for instance, fails  to take advantage of the substantial progress \nand advances some banks have made in their internal credit rating systems, financial models and economic capital calculations.  \nBecause of the need to have capital standard s reflect these advances, the United States is \nin the process of adopting Basel II and, in some instances, Basel IA . For the largest banks in the \nUnited States, the goal at this time is to adopt the advanced (internal ra tings-based) approach in \nBasel II rather than the standa rdized or the foundation internal  ratings-based approaches. The \nadvanced approach would apply to core banking organizations—those with consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, or with consolidated on- balance-sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion \nor more. Other U.S. banking organizations—opt- in banks—could voluntarily adopt the advanced \nBasel II standards, provided they receive approv al from their regulators after submitting detailed \nimplementation plans.  \nNine U.S. banks have been identified as core  or mandatory Basel II banks, and another 10 \nto 15 banks are expected to be voluntary opt-i n banks. Current plans are for these banks to \ncomply with the advanced measurement a pproach for operational risk. However, and \n 5\n\nnoteworthy, our recent request for public comments asks fo r views on whether large banks \nshould be able to use the other credit and operational risk alternatives in Basel II. \nOur implementation of Basel II will be phased in over a number of years to give banks \nand the markets time to learn and adjust to the new standards. Full implementation of Basel II for \nU.S. banks may not be until 2012 at the earliest. Wh ile U.S. regulators have concerns that this \ndelayed implementation will put U.S. banks behind some of their interna tional counterparts, we \nwant to make sure that banks maintain adequa te capital levels while implementing their risk \nmodels and transitioning to Basel II.  \nI mentioned Basel IA a moment ago. This appr oach would be available to banks that are \nnot far enough along in their credit rating system s and models to adopt the Basel II standards. \nOne of the intentions behind Basel IA is to keep these banks from being put at a capital \ndisadvantage when competing in the same loan markets as Basel II adopters.  \nThis alternative approach would allow a great er variety of risk weights compared to \nBasel I. For instance, Basel IA would allow a ra nge of risk weights for residential mortgages \nbased on loan-to-value ratios a nd possibly the borrower’s credit history. Other proposed aspects \nof Basel IA include greater use of external cr edit ratings to set risk weights and lower risk \nweights for small business loans guaranteed by owners and collateralized by business assets.  \nBanks not electing to use Basel IA could conti nue to use Basel I, unless regulators decide \nthat the organization’s risk prof ile would not be captured adequa tely by the existing standards. \nThese Basel I banks would presumably be thos e that already hold capital in excess of the \nstandards and don’t want to be burdened with the cost of shif ting to a new capital framework.  \nThe combined framework of Basel I, IA and II consequently reflects the view that a “one \nsize fits all” approach to capit al won’t work very well in toda y’s diverse banking environment. \n 6\n\nRather than relying on one capital framework that  would be too burdensome for smaller banks or \ntoo simplistic to capture risk exposures at larger  institutions, U.S. supervisors will be taking a \nmore varied approach.  \n \nCapital ratios aren’t enough \n \n \nThe role of overseeing the safety and s oundness of financial institutions necessarily \ninvolves much more than calculating capital levels and implementing capital standards. Basel II \nitself, in fact, recognizes that numerical capital standards aren’t enough and, accordingly, \nincludes Pillars 2 and 3. These two pillars establ ish a framework for ensuring that supervision \nand market discipline have an appropriate role in the risk-based capital process. \nBeyond this role in reinforcing capital standa rds, risk-based superv ision and marketplace \ndiscipline fulfill an even broader and more essen tial role in directing the actions of financial \ninstitutions toward a stable  financial environment.  \nA new supervisory framework and increased ma rket discipline should be regarded as \nessential elements as we develop a more risk -based approach to both bank capital and banking \noversight. Risk-based supervision will have to replace the more restrictive banking rules of the \npast. Additionally, markets, in fulfilling their established role of allocating resources, will have to pass judgment on acceptable bank capital and risk levels.  \nWith regard to bank supervision, there is no question supervisors need to review and \nassure banks of all sizes accurate ly measure, manage and report the risks they assume. In the \ntransition to a more risk-based capital and supe rvisory framework, an accurate picture of a \nbank’s major assets and risk exposures will be of  central importance, with this picture based \nincreasingly on a bank’s internal credit and risk  analysis. Consequently, bank supervisors will \n 7\n\nneed to work with banks and their management  to ensure that a bank’s current systems and \npractices are adequate and capable of accurately informing the market of its financial and \noperating position. As reflected by Basel IA and II in the United States, risk-based supervision \nwill need to be tailored to the individual bank and its activities, but the basic objective remains \nthe same—ensuring a safe, sound and competitive banking system.  \nMarket discipline and public disclosure—a s reflected in Basel II’s Pillar 3—are \nimportant tools a country and its banking supervis ors can use to reinforce a risk-based approach \nto supervision and capital standards. In many inst ances, market discipline and disclosure provide \nthe most effective way to encourage bank mana gement to pursue sound policies and make any \nneeded changes, especially at the world’s largest banks. Financial de regulation has clearly \nelevated the role of market discipline in allocating financial res ources and ensuring sound \nbanking conditions. A number of recent studies, in  fact, have concluded that weaknesses in \nmarket discipline have contributed to  many of the recent financial crises.  \nUnder the Basel capital standards, market disc ipline and public disclo sure have a critical \nrole to play. For market discipline to be effectiv e in this process, investors and depositors must \nhave the necessary information and the confid ence to make decisions about which financial \ninstitutions are deserving of their funds. At the hear t of this market process, banks will need to be \nopen about their risk exposures, the adequacy of  their risk measuring and management practices, \nand their capital decisions. In turn, supervisors w ill have to take a strong position in ensuring that \nbank disclosures are accurate and complete.  \nDisclosure and transparency will be of signi ficant value in other aspects of the Basel \nimplementation process as well. In this regard, the quantitative impact studies that have been \nconducted for Basel II have shown a substantial va riation across banks in their calculations of \n 8\n\nrequired capital. Variation is also  likely to occur over  the credit cycle, depending on how long of \na period banks use to calculate default and lo ss probabilities. Other di fferences will exist \ninternationally as countries implement Basel II. All these differences will be difficult to resolve \nif bank investors, creditors and private credit rating agencies don’t have the basic information \nneeded to draw independent decisions.  \nFor emerging market countries, disclosure and transparency will be especially important \nin the transition to a more risk-based superv isory and Basel capital framework. Sound accounting \npractices and timely and accurate identification of  credit problems will be necessary for a risk-\nbased approach, whether capital or supervisory, to work. Moreove r, a country and its financial \nmarkets must ensure that instit utions disclose accurate and ma terial information about their \nperformance, credit quality and overall condition. As central bankers and supervisors, many of \nyou will undoubtedly have to play a critical  role in improving public disclosure and \ntransparency, especially as you continue develo ping your supervisory frameworks and oversight \nof financial markets.  \n \nSummary \n \n \nThe implementation of Basel II reflects the advances that are occurring in banking—both \nin terms of technological change and the pr ogress banks are making in their own risk \nmanagement systems. Basel II is also serving as a reminder of the grow ing diversity of banks \nwithin individual countries and across count ries. One result of this changing financial \nenvironment is to make a risk-based approach to capital requirements more essential, particularly \nas countries deregulate their fi nancial markets and remove provi sions that once served to limit \nrisk taking. \n 9\n\nHowever, I want to reemphasize that just making a commitment to more risk-based \ncapital standards will not be enough.  \nFor new capital standards and the remainde r of our supervisory framework to be \neffective, we will also have to take a risk-focused approach to our supervision. In this approach, \nwe must ensure that the major risks at individua l financial institutions are identified and that \nthese institutions are taking the n ecessary steps to manage their risk exposures. In addition, we \nneed to promote greater market discipline and di sclosure for financial institutions, thus bringing \nbank investors and creditors in as a more effec tive force in directing the actions of banks and \nbank management. \nOverall, we will need to strike the proper ba lance in this changing financial environment \namong the numerical calculations of Basel II, the use of risk-focused supervision and the discipline provided by the marketpla ce. All of these factors must be designed to reinforce each \nother and address the variety of risks that differe nt institutions incur. \n    \n 10"

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKansas City, Missouri \nJanuary 19, 2007 \n\n 2\n It is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the outlook for the U.S. economy \nin 2007 and the implications for monetary polic y in the period ahead.  The turn of the \nyear is traditionally a time to look back at th e events of the past year and to look forward \nto the prospects for the new year.  In the distant past, soothsayers peered into a crystal \nball to deliver their prognostications.  Nowada ys, economists use computers.  But, despite \nthe increased sophistication of the for ecasting instrument, the economic outlook is \ninherently uncertain, and there are always ri sks that the economy may perform differently \nthan expected.  \n With that caution, then, what does our high-tech crystal ball tell us about 2007?  \nOverall, the economy should continue to im prove with stronger growth and lower \ninflation.  However, there are at least two major risks that could cloud the scene.  The \nfirst of these is the housing market, where a substantial adjustment in housing activity and home price appreciation is underway.  Although there are some  signs that housing \nmay be bottoming out, weaker residential investment and related spillover effects on consumer spending remain a downside risk  to the near-term outlook for economic \ngrowth. \n The second risk is that tight labor market s or a resurgence in energy prices could \nexacerbate inflationary pressures.  Last year’s solid employment growth brought the \nunemployment rate down to a very low level, an d labor cost pressures could build if labor \nmarkets tighten further.  There is also th e ever-present risk that recent energy price \ndeclines could be reversed, leading to a less favorable outlook for inflation in the coming \nyear.  \n\n 3\nLet me spend the next few minutes providing more detail to this general outlook, \nand then I’ll close with comments on its  implications for monetary policy. \nA quick look back  \n To provide some perspective on the outlook, it may be helpful first to look back at \nsome of the key economic developments in 2006.  Last year, real GDP grew near its trend \nrate of about 3 percent, but the growth rate slowed notably over the course of the year.  \nGrowth in the second half of 2006 likely averaged around 2 percent to 2.5 percent at an \nannual rate, about half the average ra te of the first half of the year. \n Much of the softening in growth last year can be attribut ed to weaker housing \nmarket activity and lower automotive production.  Some analysts feel these sectors were \nunsustainably strong earlier in the expansion, and now they may be adjusting back toward \nmore sustainable levels.  In addition, past increase s in interest rates have slowed housing \nactivity, and higher energy prices earlier in the year hurt auto sales.  Housing and autos \nalso affect a broad network of industria l suppliers, causing a slowdown in several \nmanufacturing and materials industries.  But,  there is little evid ence so far that the \nsoftness in housing and autos has spilled over to other parts of the economy, especially \nconsumer spending. \n Employment grew fast enough last year to  keep labor market conditions relatively \ntight.  The civilian unemployment rate drifte d down by 0.5 percentage  point over the year \nto 4.5 percent in December.  Although this une mployment rate is below most estimates of \nthe full-employment rate, recent reports on labor  costs are mixed, with some hinting at \nincreased labor cost pressures while others remain fairly steady. \n\n 4\n Partly because of higher energy prices in the first part of 2006, consumer price \ninflation was higher last year than I woul d find acceptable over the long term. The core \nCPI, which excludes food and energy prices , rose 2.6 percent over the past 12 months.  \nCore inflation was even higher than th at in the spring and summer of 2006, but \nmoderated somewhat at yea r’s end as growth slowed and energy prices declined. \nA look ahead at 2007  \n Looking into 2007, we are likely to see some  important shifts in  the trajectories \nfor growth and inflation.  Although real GDP growth slowed over the last year, I expect \nto see a recovery in growth in 2007 back toward trend.  And, I expect to see core \nconsumer price inflation gradually recede from last year’s unacceptably high rate. \n In my view, real GDP growth is likely  to rise gradually from 2 percent to 2.5 \npercent annually in the second ha lf of last year to around 2.5 percent to 3 percent in 2007.  \nThe gradual recovery in growth will reflect se veral factors.  First, the drag on growth \nfrom the housing market should diminish by mid-year as housing markets stabilize.  \nSecond, the spillover effects from housing on consumer spending should continue to be \nrelatively small and be offset by such other factors as solid employme nt and labor income \ngrowth.  And third, the more favorable energy pri ce developments in the second half of \n2006 have raised households’ discretionary income and boosted their willingness to \nspend. \nFinancial conditions also remain favora ble for growth.  The more restrictive \nstance of monetary policy over the recent past has helped contain long-term inflation \nexpectations and helped hold long-term interest rates rela tively low.  Moreover, these \n\n 5\nactions have set a favorable background for the stock market, which posted strong gains \nlast year. \nFavorable financial conditions and strong profit growth should encourage further \nsolid gains in business investment, which are likely to offset some of the continuing \nweakness in housing.  In addition, internat ional trade should be less of a drag on \neconomic growth this year, and perhaps even  a contributor to gr owth.  The temporary \nslowing of growth is helping hold down imports, and past depreciation of the dollar has made our products more competitive in world markets. \nSolid foreign economic growth will also en courage stronger gains in U.S. exports \nthis year.  Although world growth may moderate somewhat from last year’s pace, the consensus outlook is that world growth will remain more than 3 percent.  Moreover, growth will likely remain strong in many emer ging markets.  For example, growth in \nChina is projected to be almost 10 percent, a nd Indian growth could be near 8 percent.  \nLast year’s decline in ener gy prices has supported foreign demand, helping balance world \ngrowth by making it less de pendent on U.S. imports. \nWith our real GDP only gradually rising toward trend this year, labor market \npressures should moderate somewhat in the first half of the year.  Although I do not \nexpect large changes in the unemployment rate, we could see the unemployment rate \nmove back toward 5 percent over the course of the year. \nAs to the inflation outlook, most for ecasters expect some moderation of the \ninflation rate in 2007.  Past monetary policy actions combined with moderate economic growth and stable energy price pressures should contribute to a reduction in both the \noverall and core inflation rates.   \n\n 6\nRecent inflation readings seem largely c onsistent with this expectation.  In \nparticular, core CPI inflation has slowed noti ceably in the last few months.  For example, \nthe three-month average inflation rate for co re CPI fell from a high of 3.8 percent last \nMay to 1.4 percent in December.  The 12- month average has shown less improvement, \nfalling from a high of 2.9 percent in Septembe r to 2.6 percent in December.  I share the \nview that core consumer price inflation is lik ely to moderate from last year’s high level, \nand I think that we will continue to see stable long-term inflation expectations.  \nRisks to the outlook for growth and inflation  \n As always, there are many uncertainties in  the outlook, so let me turn, now, to a \ndiscussion of some of the major risks to economic growth and inflation.   \nThe housing market  \nThe housing risk is foremost in the minds of many homeowners and home \nbuilders right now.  Some obser vers have warned for some time that the housing market \nwas overheated.  Over the past several years, there was a rapid increase in home prices \nfueled partly by low mortgage rates.  The increase in household wealth from home price \nappreciation also helped su stain strong consumption grow th in the current expansion. \nClearly, we have now seen a substantial cooling in housing market activity in \nmost parts of the country.  Single-family housing starts have dropped about 25 percent \nfrom a year ago, and both new- and existing-home sales have declined sharply. \nMoreover, the slowdown in home sales a nd the increased inventory of unsold \nhomes have dramatically reduced the rate of home price apprecia tion.  The Office of \nFederal Housing Enterprise Oversight’s nati onal home price index rose at a 3.5 percent \nannual rate in the third quarter of 2006, whic h is down substantially  from a 12 percent \n\n 7\nrate in the last quarter of 2005.  And, some areas of the country, where house prices were \nmost elevated, have experienced substantial price declines.   \nThe slowing in the housing market has dire ct and indirect effects on the economy.  \nLess home construction means fewer jobs fo r construction workers and fewer building \nmaterials purchased.  Moreover, the reduced appreciation in home values may have \nimportant indirect effects by lowering the grow th rate of household w ealth and the ability \nof households to easily tap into  past wealth gains.  In re cent years, many homeowners \nhave used their home equity to finance st rong consumption growth  through mortgage \nrefinancing or home equity loans. \nThe risk of a sharper-than-predicted slowdown in residential investment and \nfalling home prices cannot be dismissed entirely .  Policymakers will need to monitor the \nsituation carefully, both in terms of the state of the housing market and its broader economic effects. \n But, there are also some good reasons to think that the adjustment in the housing \nmarket may be more moderate going forward.  We are already seeing some signs that the \nhousing market may be near the bottom.  Hous ing starts and home sales have increased \nsomewhat from their lows in 2006, and home builders’ attitudes and mortgage applications to purchase a home are no longer plummeting.  Underlying this more positive tone are fairly low mortgage rates and strong labor market conditions, although \nsome of the improvement may also reflect mild weather at the end of last year. \n Moreover, continued income and employm ent growth and high levels of stock \nmarket wealth will help to cushion any adverse effects of the weaker housing market on consumer spending.  I do not mean to say that we could not see further weakness in \n\n 8\nhousing activity and prices, but the evidence at this point sugges ts that the housing \nmarket adjustment is unlikely to dera il the broader economic expansion.    \nLabor markets and energy prices    \nThere are also factors which pose upside  risks to the inflation outlook.  Strong \nlabor market conditions could result in cost  pressures that are passed on to consumer \nprices.  In addition, disruptions to energy s upplies could result in renewed strength in \nenergy prices. \n Despite the slowdown in overall economi c activity in 2006, employment growth \nremained solid.  Payroll employment growth  averaged about 150,000 jobs per month in \n2006, and the unemployment rate declined over th e course of the year.  Growth in service \nand government jobs offset weakness in manufacturing and construction. \n In reviewing these data, I would note that  one reason labor markets have remained \nrelatively tight is that the labor force has not  been growing as fast  as in the past.  \nDemographic factors, such as the aging of the baby-boom generation and the smaller size \nof the following generations, are part of the explanation.  Also, the labor force \nparticipation rate of women has stabil ized after trending upward for many years \n Recent research conducted at our Bank suggests the trend growth rate for \nemployment over the next 10 years may be around 120,000 jobs per month.  Thus, it \nshould not be too surprising that  last year’s employment gr owth has kept labor market \nconditions fairly tight. \n The tight labor market conditions have put some pressure on labor costs.  For \nexample, growth of unit labor costs has drifted upward over the last couple of years.  This increase partly reflects stronger gains in compensation per hour.  Compensation growth \n\n 9\nwas particularly strong in the first quarter of last year wh en some employees received \nexceptionally large bonuses. Faster growth of  unit labor costs also  reflected weaker \nproductivity gains in 2006 as re al GDP growth fell below trend. \n Should these recent trends in compensati on and productivity continue, there is a \nrisk that businesses may be under pressure to raise prices.  Al though a risk, there are \nforces in play that may restrain increased la bor cost pressures from contributing to a rise \nin inflation in 2007.  Some companies, for example, may absorb increased cost pressures \nthrough reduced profit margins rather than raise prices and risk losing valued customers.  \nIn addition, productivity growth should rebound in 2007 because of strong business \ninvestment and the continued adoption of ne w technologies.  And, there is no evidence \nyet, at least, that labor market tightness is fostering an inflationary psychology. \n A second immediate risk to the inflation outlook is that we could see a resurgence of energy prices in 2007.  The decline in energy prices during  the second half of 2006 and \nso far this year is a welcome development as it helps to lower short-term inflation \npressures while providing support to consumer spending.   \nHowever, many analysts view the recent en ergy price declines as resulting from a \nmore favorable short-run suppl y situation rather than l onger run fundamentals.  In \nparticular, these analysts attribute the recen t weakness in energy prices to a combination \nof higher-than-normal inventories coupled with a more benign fall hurricane season, \nunusually warm weather earlier in the wint er, and the absence of  major geopolitical \ndisruptions in supply.  Thus, th ere is a risk that price pre ssures could reemerge if the \nsupply situation worsens in an  environment of steadily in creasing world energy demand.  \nMonetary policy in 2007  \n\n 10\n Let me close with some discussion on the outlook for monetary policy in the \nperiod ahead.  In doing so, I am not in a positio n to speculate about th e future course of \npolicy.  Instead, I hope to conve y some of my thinking about the factors that will shape \nthe Federal Open Market Committee’s decisions in the period ahead. \n In my opinion, there has been a discrepa ncy lately between the views of FOMC \nmembers, as summarized in the Committee’s public statements, a nd the views of many \nfinancial market participants.  Although there is a wide ra nge of views in the market, \nsome participants have jumped to the conclusi on that monetary policy will be eased in the \nnear future.  Surveys of financial market ec onomists show that many expect an easing in \nmonetary policy sometime this year.  In a ddition, the yield curve and financial futures \nprices incorporate some expected easing of monetary policy later this year.  \n In contrast, the FOMC has continued to express its concern about the upside \ninflation risks.  After its last meeting on D ec. 12, the FOMC stated that “some inflation \nrisks remain,” and that the “extent and timi ng of any additional firming” would depend \non how incoming data affected the outlook for growth and inflation. \nIn my view, the easing of monetary policy that market participants expect would \nbe appropriate only if inflati on clearly subsided from recent elevated levels, and if the \nincoming data implied the inflation outlook w ould remain favorable in the future.  And, \nof course, it would depend too on the growth  path of the economy itself.  In my \njudgment, it is premature to conclude that current conditions defi ne a clear path for \npolicy.  Although recent inflation reports have been encouraging, the inflation rate over \nthe last 12 months remains higher than I would find acceptable for the long term. And, as \n\n 11\nI suggested earlier, upside infl ation risks still exist from pos sible labor market pressures \nor higher energy prices.      \n As economic data accumulate over the ne xt few months, I suspect some of the \ncurrent uncertainty will dissipate, and we will have a clearer view of the monetary policy \npath going forward."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n              \nWestern States Bank Direct ors Education Foundation \nTucson, AZ \nOctober 30, 2006 \n  \n  \n\n \n Those of you with several years of business ex perience in this part of the country may \nrecognize that many of the things we ar e hearing today about the economy have \ncounterparts in the past: Asset values are ap preciating, farmland values are strong and we \nare all well-aware of what has occurred this year with the energy markets. In short, for \nmany in this area of th e country, times are good. \n  At the start of the 1980s, we were told  that oil prices could only go higher, \nfarmland was a solid investment because, “t hey aren’t making any more of it,” and \nhousing and stock markets w ould continue to climb. \n  Of course, if you were involved in  business or banking 20 years ago, you will \nrecall that several of the financial decisions  made on those speculative forecasts created \ntheir own sets of problems, so me reaching far beyond local banks. \n  Today, I am told that while there may be some similarities with current banking conditions and those of a quarter century ago, things are different th is time. You may be \nhearing the same thing from investors and bankers, and, in fact, you may be saying to \nyourself: This time, it’s different.   Or is it?   Through the late ‘70s and ‘80s I had the opportunity of be ing an officer in \nbanking supervision at the Federal Reserve Ba nk of Kansas City.  I spent those years \nheavily involved in the banking crisis that enveloped the Tenth Federal Reserve District, \na region that includes the central United St ates: Nebraska, Kansas , Oklahoma, Wyoming, \nColorado, northern New Mexico and western Missouri.    \n\n  Confidence abounded among borrowers, bankers and even supervisors during the \nearly 1980s.  And, as with any euphoric environment, potential pitfalls abound.    I realize this is not new information to  many of you – maybe to none of you.  But I \nbelieve that this is a particularly apt time  to take a retrospective look at banking and \nfinance.  We now have a new generation of bankers who haven’t experienced much in the \nway of a substantial banking downturn.  Furthermore, many who can recall the 1980s will soon be leaving the business, and we need to gain from their knowledge and experience \nbefore they leave.  Lastly , it never hurts to be remi nded of important lessons. \n Let me share with you some statements that  we actually heard from bankers and bank \ndirectors during the ‘80s:     “I am the CEO of this bank, and we’re doing it my way.” \n“Yes, we loaned a hundred percent on this  project, but everyone knows that the \ncollateral value can only go up during construction.” \n \n  “If you understood this better, you w ouldn’t have a problem with it.”  \n  “Although this is unconventional, our acc ountant says it is perfectly legal.”  \n  “The corporate plane will save m oney for the bank in the long run.” \n“We have put our problems behind us – our  bank rating will be much improved at \nour next exam.”  “If it weren’t for the examiners, this bank wouldn’t have failed.” \n   \nLessons from the 1980s \nBefore I go further, let me provide a brief background on the 1980s to remind us \nof the context of these stories – all of which happened in our Federal Reserve District.  In \nthe 1980s, community banks made up much of the District banking population, with a \n\nnumber of regional organizations  filling out the total – a tren d that continues today with \nadditional entry by a number of la rge interstate organizations.   \nDistrict banks played various roles in  speculative booms in agriculture, energy \nand commercial real estate – all of which were significant for the District economy – and \nwhich all came to a precipitous end.  The pri ce of crude oil, for example rose from $2.75 \na barrel in 1973 to a peak of nearly  $37 in 1981 before dropping to $10 in 1986. \nSimilarly, farmland values in Nebraska rose by more than fourfold in the 10-year period \nbefore 1982, but then dropped by 45 percent duri ng the next five years.  Inflation was \naround 13 percent at the beginning of the 1980s , and the prime rate reached 20.5 percent \nin 1981. \nThe sharp economic fluctuations had a se vere impact on District banks.  During \nthe 1980s, 309 banks failed in District states , which was 11 percent of the 1980 District \nbanking population. Now, let me recognize one very important point before I go on. Most \nbanks in the 1980s, like banks today, were well-run, prudent and successful. But some \nmanagers couldn’t resist the po ssibility of greater profit.  Th ese examples are designed to \nsteer you away from similar mistakes. \nFor each of the statements I shared prev iously, there is a story around the events \nthat eventually unfolded.  I have three more statements fo r which I want to provide the \nstory of the consequences.  I hope these will serve as examples of what you, as directors, \nneed to be alert to when exercising oversigh t at your banks. Age-ol d behaviors, such as \ngreed, shortsightedness, and a rrogance, are at the center of  these problems, and, I would \ncaution, they are with us today ju st as they were in the 1980s. \n\nThe first comment stems from one of the most prominent examples of the ‘80s \nbanking crisis: \n \n“The examiners are dead wrong, they  don’t understand what we’re doing – \nthey don’t have a clue about our business.” \nAt the height of the agricultural, energy and commercial real estate booms of the \nlate 1970s and early 1980s, competition among lenders was intense.  When our examiners would ask about a loan with que stionable characteristics during this period, \nthey too often heard bankers say, “If I don’t make the loan, the ba nker down the street \nwill.”  In many cases, unfortunately, this turn ed out to be a race to the bottom.    \nNowhere was this more evident than in  the area of energy lending.  Good loan \nunderwriting standards were often swept away  under an aura of op timism and the belief \nthat oil prices could only go up.  In this environment, repayment ability was not a \nconcern, especially because rising oil prices  would bail out any lender, and good loan \ndocumentation was something to be done la ter, provided the lending business slowed \ndown at some point.   \nOne notable or, in this case, notorious  District energy lender was Penn Square \nBank of Oklahoma City.  If you’ve read books  like “Funny Money” or “Belly Up,” you \nknow a lot of major banks courted Penn Squa re and competed with one another to \nparticipate in the bank’s seemingly lucrativ e energy lending busine ss.  Energy lending \nwas the hottest ticket in banking then, and in the race to stake out a position, none of \nthese major banks paid any real attenti on to Penn Square’s loan underwriting and \nadministration or did much in the way of their own due diligence.  In many cases, the \n\nloan participations were bought on blind faith  and unlimited optimism.  For Penn Square, \nthis provided an incentive to make loans to  anyone who walked in the door, and Penn \nSquare sold more than $2.1 billion in loan participations to 88 banks, including eight of \nthe top 50 banks in the country.  Greed, t hus, overwhelmed reason for all who were \ninvolved.  This, in some ways, strikes me as  similar to some “hedge funds” excesses of \nthe recent past.  \nThe outcome of these practices back th en was the failure of Penn Square Bank \nduring the Fourth of July weekend in 1982.  At  the Federal Reserve, we were faced with \na decision on whether to continue lending to Penn Square through the discount window \nor to stop and let it fail that weekend.  With all the questionable energy loans on Penn \nSquare’s books, there was little to be salvaged, and a few colleagues and I found \nourselves spending the holiday weekend work ing on what to do about it.  After Penn \nSquare’s failure, FDIC Chairman William Isaac made clear where the blame lay when he \nstated, “The Penn Square debacle was caused by a gross dereliction of  duty on the part of \nthe bank’s board of directors and management.”   \nPenn Square’s failure also led to a ripple  effect within the banking industry.  A \nstaggering total of more than $1.1 billion in Penn Square loans had been sold to the supposedly more sophisticated Continental Illinois National Bank. These loans received \nlittle, if any, review by Continen tal Illinois’ management and se rved as the initial impetus \ntoward that bank’s eventual failure in 1984.  Seattle First National Bank was also a heavy \nbuyer of Penn Square loans.  After Penn Square ’s failure, Sea-First quickly slipped from \nbeing a darling of stock market analysts to a bank shut out of funding markets and pushed \nto the brink of failure.  The only thing that prevented it from becoming the largest U.S. \n\nbank failure at that time was its hurried acquisition by Bank of America under a special \nWashington state failing-bank law.  Several ot her major banks also took significant losses \non Penn Square loans and fell into a weakened condition.  \nThe simple fact is there are times when it is wise not to jump on the bandwagon.  \nIn some instances, it is bette r to let the parade pass you by. As directors, you should be \nextremely cautious if your management can’t fully and clearly expl ain the business lines \nthey are about to enter or if there is  too much of a rush  to jump in.   \n \n“If you understood this better, you wouldn’t have a problem with it.” \nThere are a host of stories from the 1980s  and early 1990s of individuals thinking \nthey had a sure thing – something that would produce spectacular returns with little or no \nrisk.  Unfortunately, bank directors have some times been caught up in this enthusiasm as \nwell.  One banker, for instance, became a lo an originator, relying entirely on another \norganization to be the secondary market conduit.   It seemed like a foolproof strategy with \nfar better returns than the bank’s ag lending business in the 1980s – simply find willing \nloan customers funneled through from distant sources, make sure the loan paperwork is \nfilled out properly, and then watch the conduit purchase the loans and place them in the secondary market.  For several years, this  strategy worked – great origination and \nservicing fees, virtually no credit  risk with the quick sale of loans, and a big boost to local \nemployment.  Eventually, however, the mark et conduit cancelled its contract with the \nbank, thus leaving the bank itself to fund and hold all the loans it was making.  The \nbank’s balance sheet ballooned with the infl ux of loans, and the bank soon found that \n\nmany of these loans were of questionable quality – a fact that eventually led to the bank’s \nfailure. \nAnother bank from this period had a hist ory of struggling along and was glad to \nfinally pick up some new ownership, especially  because this change brought in two fast-\ntrack partners from a securities firm.  S oon the bank’s investment portfolio was earning \nreturns well above market rates – an outcome  that pleased the directors and led to \nmanagement bonuses.   \nNo one seemed prepared to question how  the bank could continue to earn above-\nmarket returns on U.S. government securities. The answer came out later.  One of the \npartners in the securities firm was charged with fraud, through a Ponzi scheme, and with \nmoney laundering, and the bank became a defendan t in a securities la wsuit.  After losing \nthe lawsuit, the bank was insolvent. \nSimilar stories can be found in other banks.  A particularly common story \nconcerns structured notes.  How many banks bought such notes through bond salesmen \nwith the idea that they carried  high returns but were safe because they were backed by the \nFederal Home Loan Bank System and the federal government?  One banker even told us he didn’t have to worry about his securities because his broker “controlled” the risk for \nhim.  In many cases, bankers never gave a second thought to th e significant risks \nstructured notes presented to their banks. \n \n“Didn’t you learn from corporate fina nce that leverage can be powerful?” \n  Franklin Savings was a Kansas thrift  institution that made a name for itself \nthrough its complex arbitrage operations, expert  staff and ability to “outsmart” major \n\nsecurities firms on trades. Franklin Savings started out as a small traditional thrift \ninstitution in a small Kansas town.  Like ma ny thrifts in the early 1980s, Franklin Savings \nfaced substantial losses from interest rate mismatches in its mortgage portfolio.  In \nresponse, Franklin changed its  business model to an arbitr age and hedging strategy, using \nbrokered deposits to fund its pos itions in mortgage-backed securities, junk bonds and the \nfutures market.  The thrift brought in an im pressive staff of Wall Street and capital \nmarkets hotshots to carry out its strategies, a nd in just a few years, Franklin grew from \nvirtually nothing to one of the largest and most  profitable thrifts in the country with more \nthan $11 billion in assets.   While Franklin Savings had impressive retu rns for a number of years, its rapid growth \n-- along with tighter thrift  capital standards under FIRRE A (Financial Institutions \nReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989)  -- turned its leverage into a regulatory \nissue.  Also, unexpected movements in interest  rates led to sizable losses at Franklin in \n1989 and to further declines in its capital ratio and net interest margins.  In a dispute over \naccounting practices, the Office of Thrift Supervision seiz ed Franklin in 1990.  What \nfollowed was a series of articles and c ourt cases in which a number of well-known \narbitrage experts took turns defending and criticizing Franklin’s reporting of hedging \ngains and losses and the length of  time it could take in recognizing some notable losses.  \nThere was no consensus on whether Franklin  was a viable institution or was truly \ninsolvent.  In the end, the courts  largely deferred to the OTS. \n Among the lessons we can learn from Fra nklin Savings is that  an institution’s \nmanagement should be able to explain fully its strategy and risk e xposure to directors, \ncurrent and prospective investor s, and bank supervisors.  Franklin also could be regarded \n\nas forerunner to today’s hedge funds, except that it was relying on insured depositors and \nits thrift charter for funding a dvantages and didn’t have larg e, sophisticated investors as \nits target clientele.  As a result, it had a great responsibility to be transparent in its \nstrategies and to maintain its capital at pr udent levels and in co mpliance with minimum \nsupervisory standards.    Some might quibble about whether the th rift examiners were knowledgeable enough \nto judge Franklin’s act ivities.  But they had enough expe rience by then to be skeptical \nwhen managers at problem institutions would tell them: “We’re too sophisticated to get \ninto trouble,” “You don’t understand, we know wh at we are doing,” and “We have a tax \n– or an accounting – angle that will make this pay off.”   \n \nConclusion \n  My purpose in reviewing these stories with  you today is not that I think a return to \na 1980s-style crisis is imminent. Certainly, banking conditions toda y are good:  strong \nearnings, good asset quality, no bank failures in more than two years.  However, those \nwho, in the early 1980s, predicted an endless rise  in energy markets and real estate values \nwere as confident in their outlook as we ar e today. And, certainly, the same rules and \nlessons continue to apply in banking and finance.    Although the world has changed during the last quarter of a century, at least one \nthing has not – human nature.  As I mentione d earlier, greed, pride, arrogance and other \nhuman frailties are often at the root of ba d banking decisions, and those qualities remain \nwith us today.  They still motivate behavior as  they have in the past, and, in many cases, \nthese frailties keep us from acting on the le ssons we should have learned from previous \n\ngenerations.  In addition, no ma tter how sophisticated we think current analytical tools, \nmanagement information systems and financial instruments are, the most critical element \nin banking is still individual experience and judgment.  In the end, bank employees, and, \nI would stress to this audience,  bank directors, are still ma king the important decisions. \nThe quality of those decisions will alwa ys depend on human characteristics and our \nability to learn from the past.   One banking scholar said, “There is r eally nothing new in banking and finance, \neach generation just thinks there is.” So, are we  in a different situa tion than 20 years ago? \nI would suggest that one way we can ensure  a different outcome is if you, in your \noversight capacity as bank directors, are wi lling to be skeptical, willing to ask the \ndifficult questions and unwilling to accept the answer “This time, it’s different.”"

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNew Mexico Economic Forums \nAlbuquerque, New Mexico \nOctober 3, 2006 \n\n 2\n It is a pleasure to be in  Albuquerque tonight and to have  this opportunity to share \nmy views on the economic outlook and m onetary policy.  Although our economy has \nperformed well over the last few years, so me observers are uneasy about the current \nsituation.  Economic growth is slowing from  the brisk pace earlier in the year, and \ninflation has been higher than desired as pa st increases in energy and other materials \nprices raised production costs and strained consumer budgets. \n Much of the recent concern has been driv en by two issues.  One of these is the \nrisk of a larger than antici pated decline in the housing market.  Although economists have \nbeen predicting a slowing in the housing market  for some time, definitive signs of this \nslowing only appeared in the last few months.  The extent of this slowing and its impact \non future consumer spending is naturally a concern because the family home is the \nprimary asset for many households. \nThe other issue is uncertainty about the di rection of energy prices.  Over the past \nthree years, sharp increases in petroleum prices have pressured household budgets and \nraised the inflation rate.  But, recently, we  have seen gasoline prices declining and \npetroleum inventories building, creating uncertainty about future energy price \nmovements. \n In tonight’s remarks, I would first like to provide a br ief assessment of current \neconomic conditions and the outlook through 2007.  Then I will spend some time \ndiscussing the issues related to the hous ing and energy markets and how these might \ninfluence the outlook.  Finally, I will speak br iefly about some of the challenges facing \nmonetary policy in the period ahead.  I w ould emphasize that these views are my own \n\n 3\nand do not represent the official position of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal \nOpen Market Committee. \nCurrent Economic Conditions  \n Let me begin by taking a closer look at  recent economic performance.  Real GDP \ngrew at a brisk pace in the firs t half of this year.  Although growth slowed from the first \nquarter to the second, real outpu t expanded at a 4 percent rate  over the first half of 2006, \nwell above the economy’s long-run sustainable rate.  Part of this surge in economic \nactivity was, however, a re bound from economic weakness in  the second half of 2005 \nrelated to the Gulf hurricanes , higher energy costs, and re duced auto sales incentives. \n Most forecasters believe that growth slowed further in the third quarter because of another decline in residentia l investment and more moderate business investment in \nstructures and inventories.  Housing starts and sales declin ed over the last few months, \nthe inventory of unsold homes on the market is rising, and home pr ice appreciation is \ndecelerating.  However, consumer spending a ppears to be growing moderately despite the \npressure on household budgets from  past energy price gains.  \n Although the labor market remains healthy, the pace of hiring slowed in the spring.  Nonfarm payroll employment grew at  an average pace of 176,000 jobs per month \nin the first quarter of this year, but on ly by about 119,000 jobs per month over the next \nfive months.  While hiring has slowed, the unemployment rate was quite low in August at \n4.7 percent of the labor force.  This unemp loyment rate is below the level that many \neconomists believe is consistent with full employment and stable prices. \n The inflation rate has been a major concer n so far in 2006.  Past sharp increases in \nenergy prices caused broad inflation measures to  rise over the last few years.  Reflecting \n\n 4\nhigh resource utilization and some pass-thr ough of higher energy pri ces, core inflation \nmeasures, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, also worsened earlier this year.  \nFor example, the core CPI inflation rate rose from about 2.2 percent in 2005 to 2.8 percent over the year ending in August.  This is a pace of inflation that I would not find \nacceptable over the longer term.  However, it is encouraging that core CPI inflation \nmoderated somewhat in July and August, and core producer price infl ation eased as well. \nThe Economic Outlook  \n Although policymakers carefully monitor cu rrent conditions, our focus is on what \nthe indicators imply for the economic outlook.  Monetary policy must be forward-looking \nbecause policy actions affect growth and infl ation with long lags.  With that in mind, let \nme turn to the outlook for real economic growth and inflation. \n Reflecting past increases in energy prices  and interest rates, many forecasters now \nanticipate somewhat below-trend real GDP growth over the second half of this year and \nfor most of 2007.  Many economists believe th e potential growth rate for the U.S. \neconomy is around 3 to 3 ¼ percent. \nI share the view that real growth is likel y to be slightly below the potential growth \nrate, averaging around 2 to 2 ½ percent at an annual rate over the second half of this year \nand around 2 ½ to 3 percent in 2007.   But I would stress that the economy is likely to \nkeep expanding, and that growth that is a lit tle below trend in the near term may help to \nkeep the economy from overheating and thus  sustain growth over the longer term. \n An important factor in this outlook ha s been the gradual tig htening of monetary \npolicy.  Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve has raised its federal funds  rate target from \n1 percent to the current level of  5 ¼ percent.  Over this pe riod, the stance of monetary \n\n 5\npolicy has moved from being extremely accommoda tive to a setting that I would describe \nas somewhat restrictive.  Other interest rates have also incr eased over this period, \nalthough the rise in long-term ra tes has been fairly moderate. \n  Much of the slowing in economic gr owth will likely come from housing and \nconsumer spending.  To some degree, higher interest rates have produced this slowing \nbecause housing and consumer durables spending are interest-sensitive sectors.  In \naddition, past increases in oil prices hurt c onsumer confidence and left many households \nwith less income to spend on di scretionary items.  Moreover, sharp gains in home prices \nhave reduced the affordability of new homes for first-time buyers. \n Offsetting some of the weakness in c onsumer spending and housing will probably \nbe healthy business investment and solid e xport growth.  With regard to business \ninvestment, equipment spending was weaker th an expected in the second quarter, but \nnonresidential construction poste d large gains, partly due to  increased spending on energy \nproduction.  Orders for capital equipment con tinue to trend upward, and operating rates \nare above-average in the manu facturing sector.  Moreover, strong growth in corporate \nprofits should help to sustain business investment spending.   \n In addition, export growth will likely be  a positive for economic growth through \n2007.  Although the latest monthly trade de ficit was disappointing, much of the \ndeterioration was due to high oil imports.  Going forward, solid growth by our major \ntrading partners should increase the de mand for U.S. goods and services.  The \nInternational Monetary Fund, for example, ju st raised its forecast for world economic \ngrowth in 2006 and 2007.  At the same time, the expected slower growth in domestic household spending should moderate import grow th.  As a result, I expect international \n\n 6\ntrade to be less of a drag on growth over the next year or so, and possibly even a modest \ncontributor to growth. \n With real GDP growth slowing below th e trend rate, labor market pressures are \nlikely to ease somewhat.  Although I do not e xpect large changes in the unemployment \nrate, we could see the unemployment rate drift upward by late next year to 5 percent, or \nperhaps slightly higher. \n As to the inflation outlook, most for ecasters expect some moderation in the \ninflation rate over the next year or so.  Sl ower economic growth and reduced energy price \npressures are expected to gradually reduce bot h the overall and core inflation rates.  I \nshare the view that core consumer price infl ation is likely to moderate from the elevated \npace in the first half of this year, and I am pleased that long-term inflation expectations \nwere reasonably well contained during the past run-ups in oil prices.    \nA Closer Look at Housing and Energy  \n As always, there are many uncertainties about the economic outlook.  I want to \nhighlight two issues in particular because th ese issues are foremost in the minds of many \neconomists as well as American households.  Thes e are, first, the risk of a sharper than \nexpected decline in residen tial investment and, second, un certainty about the future \ndirection of energy prices. \nWith respect to housing, some observers have warned for a long time that the \nhousing market was becoming overheated.  Over the past several year s, there has been a \nrapid increase in the value of U.S. housing fueled by low mortgage rates.  This has \nincreased household wealth and contributed to strong growth in household consumption \nduring the current economic expansion.  If housing prices have risen above levels \n\n 7\ndictated by economic fundamentals, there is  a chance that housing prices could fall, \nhurting consumption as well as  residential investment. \nMy own view is that the housing market is  cooling, but this adjustment seems to \nbe happening in an orderly way.  Of course , orderly does not necessa rily mean painless, \nbut there appears to be enough strength in other sectors to keep  real GDP growing.  \nPolicymakers, however, must remain aware of  the risk that the housing market might \nsoften more than is built in to current economic forecasts. \nEvidence of a cooling housing market is abundant.  Single-family housing starts \nfell more than 20 percent over the last year .  Existing home sales and new home sales \nhave also declined this year , and the number of unsold hom es on the market has risen.  \nHome price appreciation as measured by th e OFHEO index has slowed sharply from over \na 13 percent annual rate last year to less than a 5 percen t annual rate in the second \nquarter. \nThe slowing housing market has both direct  and indirect economic effects.  Less \nhome construction means fewer jobs for construction workers and fewer building \nmaterials purchased, and a lower rate of ho me sales decreases brokerage commissions.  \nBut the reduced appreciation of homes also may have important indirect effects by \nlowering the growth rate of household wealth and the ability of households to easily tap \ninto past wealth gains.  Many homeowners have  used their home equity to finance strong \nconsumption growth through mortgage re financing or home equity loans.  \nThere is a risk of a sharper than predic ted slowdown in residential investment and \nfalling home prices, which cannot be dismi ssed entirely.  Policymakers will need to \n\n 8\nmonitor the situation carefull y, both in terms of the state of the housing market and its \nbroader economic effects. \nBut at the national level, we have not seen prolonged declines in nominal home \nprices when the housing market slowed in the past.  Moreover, continued income and \nemployment growth and high levels of stock ma rket wealth will help to sustain consumer \nspending.  As a result, I believe the housing market adjustment is unlikely to derail the \neconomic expansion. \nLet me turn to a second issue that is ve ry much on people’s minds right now—the \nfuture direction of energy prices.  The outl ook for energy prices appears to have shifted \nsomewhat. \nWe have been through a difficult period in which energy prices soared because of \nstrong world demand and unexpected disruptions  to energy supplies.  As a result, we \nhave become accustomed to nothing but bad ne ws on the energy front, and risk premiums \nwere built into energy prices to reflect possible supply disruptions.  But the forces \naffecting the energy market appear to have become more balanced. \n Oil and natural gas prices are extremely volatile by nature.  Small changes in the \nquantity of oil supplied may require large pr ice changes to balan ce the market because \ndemand is relatively insensitive to price change s in the short run.  Shocks to the energy \nmarket can come suddenly—as we saw with th e hurricanes last year —and there is little \nexcess production capacity in the world ri ght now with which to meet unexpected \ndevelopments.  Thus, the risk of a shar p upward movement in oil prices has not \ndisappeared. \n\n 9\n But although markets have focused on rising energy prices for several years, we \nnow must seriously consider the possibility  of further decreases in energy prices.  \nSupplies of petroleum products and natural gas are building, and we have seen some \nlarge declines in the prices of  gasoline prices, crude oil, and natural gas.  For example, \nthe price of a gallon of regular gasoline is more than 20 percent below levels in July.  \nNatural gas prices have also plummeted because inventories ar e at record highs for this \ntime of the year.  These recent declines in energy prices may help to moderate future inflationary pressures and free up some disc retionary income for many households and \nperhaps also cushion the effects of weaker housing. \nChallenges for Monetary Policy  \n Finally let me turn to the challenges f acing monetary policy in the period ahead.  \nIn doing so, I am not in a position to speculate about the future course of policy.  Instead, \nI hope to convey some of my thinking about  the factors that will shape the FOMC’s \ndecisions in the period ahead. \n We must always remember that mone tary policy decisions are not based on \nindividual data releases.  Rather, policy decisions depend on the implications for the economic outlook of the accumulation of data over time.  Monetary policy must be forward-looking because policy influences infl ation with long lags.  Generally speaking, \na change in the federal funds rate may take an estimated 12 to 18 months to affect inflation measures. \n The existence of lags in monetary policy has two impor tant implications.  First, \nthe Federal Reserve should only respond to high current inflation to the extent that it is \nexpected to be highly persiste nt.  If inflation pressures ar e seen to be temporary and \n\n 10\npolicy is currently restrictive, maintaining the current policy stance may be consistent \nwith a reduction in inflati on over time.  Second, given the existence of po licy lags, the \nactions that the Federal Reserve took over the pa st year in raising the federal funds rate \nhave not yet had their full eff ects on the economy or inflation. \n As I have stated previously, I believe a reasonable case can be made that the \ncurrent stance of monetary polic y is likely to be consistent with a reduction in inflation \npressures over the next few quarters as en ergy prices moderate and economic growth \nslows.  If housing were to weaken more than in the consensus outl ook or if energy prices \ndropped further, the case for maintaining the current policy stance might be reinforced. \n But at the same time, I recognize that  further policy tightening could be \nwarranted if the expected slowing in infl ation does not materia lize or if long-term \ninflation expectations should rise suddenly.  As economic data accumulate over the next few months, I suspect some of the current economic uncertainty will dissipate, and we \nwill have a clearer view of the m onetary policy path going forward.  \nConcluding Comments  \n In summary, although some observers are uneasy about the current economic \nsituation, my reading of the incoming data a nd economic forecasts is that the economy is \nmaking the transition to a somewhat slower grow th path.  At the same time, inflationary \npressures may moderate if growth does slow to a below-trend pace and upward pressures \non energy prices abate. \nTwo important issues that bear close wa tching are the risk of a sharper than \npredicted slowing in the housing market and uncertainty about the future direction of \n\n 11\nenergy prices.  The forces affecting the en ergy market have become more balanced, \nhowever, with both price increase s and decreases being possible. \nThe current somewhat restri ctive stance of monetary pol icy may be sufficient to \nreduce core inflation over the ne xt few quarters.  But the course of monetary policy is not \nentirely certain and will depend on how the economy evolves in the coming months.  In \nthis regard, I can assure you that the Federal Reserve will  continue to maintain its \ncommitment to price stability and economic growth."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n      \n \n           \nCopper Mountain, Colorado \nSeptember 15, 2006 \n\n 2 From time to time, the question is raised: “Does the Federal Reserve still need 12 \nregional banks?” \n In a Wall Street Journal arti cle earlier this year, a former  vice chair of the Federal \nReserve’s Board of Governors suggested the an swer to that question is “no,” saying it is \n“very clear” 12 banks are no longer necessary  and that as few as four might be \nsufficient.  While some might occasionally suggest a reduction in the number of banks is in order, the Federal Reserve beli eves in its own future as a 12-bank system. The Federal \nReserve has invested in new facilities in Mi nneapolis, Atlanta and most recently Kansas \nCity, where we will be moving into our new headquarters building in 2008. \n However, with the changes occurr ing in the banking industry, it is \nunderstandable why some might raise the topic of the number of regional Reserve \nBanks and efficiency. The banking and ec onomic structure of the United States \nobviously has changed in the decades sin ce the Federal Reserve was created. Today, \nwhile currency remains in wide use, check writing is in decline,  and credit and debit \ncard use is becoming the standard payment means. These developments most certainly have affected Federal Rese rve operations nationwide. \n So, as a particular business changes, it is perhaps anticipated that some would \nask whether a 12-Reserve Bank system is necessar y. It is, in this narrow context, a fair \nquestion.   However, it is a question that fail s to appreciate the founding purpose and \nstructure of the Federal Reserve System. It is a question that, by its very asking, reflects \na different understanding of value versus cost.  \n\n 3 The Federal Reserve’s 12-bank system was not established as simply a check-\nprocessing system. It was designed to serve multiple interests across a variety of regions and financial institutions. It was desi gned to assure broad input to decisions and \nto provide a mechanism to build nationa l policy consensus across broad regional, \neconomic and cultural differences. And it was designed as a public-private partnership, \naccountable to, and yet indepe ndent of, the government.  To miss these connections is \nto incorrectly tie the Federal Reserve’s struct ure to its processing activities rather than \nto its efforts of assuring trust in the institution.  The 12-bank system reflects the vast economic differences among regions in the \nUnited States. It also reflects the need to provide a mechanism for input to banking and \nour important credit policy activity for each region.  Our nation’s regional differences are illustrated in a variety of forms.  For example, some years ago, I spoke with a policy person from anot her sector of the \ncountry making his first vis it to the Midwest. During the conversation he quite \nsincerely noted how impressed he  was that the city had such a “full” skyline. Clearly he \nwas surprised. Similarly, an East Coast re porter traveling to Cleveland once phoned and \nasked us if he could drive by and see th e Kansas City Bank during the trip. He \napparently thought Kansas City and Clevel and were closer than the more than 800 \nmiles that separate us. Being from Missouri,  I have come to a ppreciate in a personal \nsense our regional differences. In my travel s through the southern United States, I am \noften called a Yankee, while, in the north, I mi ght be referred to as  a Southerner. Most \nrecently I took notice of a New York Times ar ticle pointedly titled “The Not-So United \nStates.” \n\n 4 From an economic perspective, these regional variances can be even more \nstriking. One need only look at  the differences in average home prices between any \nMidwestern community and a similar community on either coast to get some idea of the \ndiversity of our economy. Re gional employment and manu facturing can also vary \ngreatly.  The fact is that as homogenous as we lik e to think we are, we remain a country \nwith large variances in regional perceptions, biases and economies.  The founders of the Federal Reserve were  clearly addressing these differences \nwhen they created our decentralized system  in 1913. Even then, decades before today’s \nhigh-speed technology, there was no compelli ng physical reason for having 12 Reserve \nBanks.  In fact, the nation previously had not one, but two monolithic central banks, both located in Philadelphia. \n  The first Central Bank of the United States was established in 1791 and was \ndesigned by Treasury Secretary Alexander Ha milton. It was controversial from the \nstart. Some protested its constitutionality. Many were fearful of its influence. \n When it came time for Congress to rene w the Bank’s charter in 1811, the Bank’s \ncritics were able to stop it. The proposed renewal lost by a margin of a single vote in \neach house of Congress.  The issue of a central bank reappeared in 1816. For five years, the country had \nbeen without a central bank to regulate banking and credit. M eanwhile, the War of \n1812 had thrown American finance into chaos. The Second Bank of the United States \n\n 5was chartered under President James Madis on, and once again there was widespread \npublic distrust.  In essence, neither the first nor seco nd central bank of the United States was \nwidely understood by the population at large.  In each case, the central bank was \nstructured as a single bank. It was central and I am sure , using today’s jargon, it was \nefficient—but mostly it was distrusted a nd even hated by some. Andrew Jackson, a \npopulist president, vetoed the renewal of the Second Bank’s charter, bringing an end to central banking in the United Stat es for the next eight decades. \n Regional distrust and dissa tisfaction crippled the nation’s first two central banks \nand contributed to their eventual demise.  Early in the 20th century, as the Un ited States became a growing economic \nforce, it was apparent the banking and financ ial system needed a “central bank.” During \nthis period, the United States faced nume rous instances of financial panic as \ncommercial banks across the country suffere d serious liquidity problems. Business \ncredit collapsed, and the public suffe red significant financial hardship. \n But there were a few hurdles to overco me in chartering this third central bank. \nAmong the most important was the question of whether the Unite d States once again \nwould have a highly centralized  institution with concentrat ed authority. Or would it be \nbest to create a new system—a decentralized  system that would share authority across \nthe nation?  In his memoirs, Paul Warburg, one of the Federal Reserve’s founders, lists the main objections to the establis hment of the central bank:  \n First: The danger of  political control, \n\n 6 Second: The danger of control by special interests, \n Third: Hurtful competition with existing banks.  The debate regarding the st ructure of the central bank went on for some time, but \nin the end, “a system of centralized reserv es and decentralized banking power is clearly \nthe system that this countr y requires,” Warburg said.  \n This time the founders better understood that to provide for a more durable \ninstitution they needed a structure that sh ared the institution’ s responsibilities and \npower across the country, not ju st with the central government and in Wall Street. It \nwas concluded our central bank should reflec t the value we Americans place in shared \ncontrol of some of our mo re important institutions. \n Each Reserve Bank has a board of direct ors from the region where it is located. \nThese directors not only provide  oversight of the Reserve Ba nks, but also information \nregarding their industries and communities. As was noted to me some time ago, \n“through these 12 Reserve Banks, the Federal Re serve has roots that run deep within \nour communities, which enables it to garner  broad public knowle dge and support, and \nto function far more effectively than if it was located in only a few places.”   \n The 12 regional banks flanking the Board of Governors keep the Federal Reserve \nfrom becoming insulated from Main Street America.    They interact with the public and financ ial institutions at a local level. In doing \nso, the central bank demonstrates it is some thing other than a cumbersome bureaucracy \ncounting its money. The board offers the public unprecedented direct access to the \nthinking of policymakers. Each bank is pa rt of the basic fabric of its community, \n\n 7providing a connection between the community and its business and policy roles. This \nhas been a critical element of the Federal Reserve’s long-run success.   This structure and these pr inciples are as important today as they were in 1913, \nperhaps more so. The Federal Reserve System remains a powerful institution. Its ability to gain and hold a broad base of trust and support is fragile, yet cr ucial to its success \nand, even more importantly, to the success of our national economy.    In terms of its overall oper ations and policy, the 12-ba nk system has consistently \nshown itself to be efficient and adaptable to change.  \n During the recent decades, it is hard to name another organization that has been \nsystematically more effective in carrying forward its missions, whether in providing \nservices to the public or c onducting day-to-day policy.   \n Just as important, the 12-bank system  has performed superbly across the nation \nduring numerous crisis situations, ranging fr om the banking crisis of the 1980s, through \nthe Y2K millennium experience, the tragedy of 9/11, and most recently during the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Of course, it may be argued that the i ssue isn’t so much about a centralized or \ndecentralized structure but about whether th e System should have fewer than 12 banks. \nThat debate also occurred at the Federa l Reserve’s founding. There was considerable, \nand often heated, discussion regarding the number of Federal Reserve Banks. Some \nwanted as few as five while others wanted more.   Even after the System was established with 12 banks, the debate continued for a \ntime. It is interesting to recall that with in about two years of the formation of the \nFederal Reserve, there was a serious confr ontation among the members of the Board of \n\n 8Governors about reducing the number of Distri cts. In the end, the Attorney General of \nthe United States wrote an opinion stating, in essence, that the Board did not have the \nauthority to unilaterally reduce the number of operating Reserve Banks. Senator Carter \nGlass, one of the lawmakers who helped crea te the Federal Reserve, said those wanting \nto reduce the number of Banks were  ignoring the will of the Senate. \n A system of reserve banks was seen as an essential element to building trust in so powerful an institution, one that would ha ve enormous influence over our economic \nlives.    It was also Paul Warburg who suggested one strength of the Reserve System lies \nin one of its weaknesses: protection agains t the dangers of an autocratic central \nadministration. In this respect, the Reserve Sy stem was preferred to a more centralized \nsystem. There is no doubt that such a sy stem, if enacted, might have been more \nefficient, but it certainly would have o ffered easier and more tempting targets for \npolitical attacks. This political superior ity of the Reserve System was of immense \nimportance, although it is, at the same time, a weakness.    Obviously, many things have changed dur ing the past eight decades.  We have \nexperienced exceptional changes in tec hnology, banking structure, banking products \nand a greater national and international scope of business and banking. But, the \nfundamentals that drove the United States towa rd a 12-bank system are as real today as \nthey were then.    Today, concern for centralized and con centrated financial power understandably \nremains important in the minds of the Amer ican public. The tre nds in consolidation \nhave only heightened concer ns in this regard.   \n\n 9 At the same time, although there has b een significant consolidation within the \nfinancial system, there remain thousands of regional and community banks which \ncontinue to play an important role across the nation. Banking activ ities vary across the \nnation and are greatly affected  by their regional economies.  \n For example, about 25 percent of New England’s banks failed in the early 1990s \nafter local real estate values collapsed. In  our own Tenth Distri ct, anyone involved in \nbusiness or banking can recall vi vidly what happened in this region after the collapse of \nvalues in agriculture, energy and real estate. While it would be nonsense to suggest that \nthese crises could not have been addressed in  a centralized banking sy stem, it is fair to \nsay they were well addressed in a decentralized, although coordinated, manner.    Knowledgeable working relationships w ith regional and community banks are \ncritical to understanding ch ange and perhaps even discove ring these types of problems \nin a timely fashion. The 12 Reserve Banks gi ve us a broad distri bution of contacts and \nmeans of interaction with commercial ba nking that is crucial for understanding and \nresponding to local banking markets. Such  interaction might be accomplished with \nfewer than 12 Reserve Banks but, I would argue, not as effectively. \n On the justification for having fewer rath er than more Reserve Banks as it relates \nto cost, I would note a couple of points. \n The System has been diligent in controlli ng its costs. Inflation-adjusted expenses \nfor the 12 banks, as reported in the Sy stem’s budget documents, have increased on \naverage about 1.5 percent a year since 1970, sh owing actual declines in real terms in \nrecent years. \n\n 10 Moreover, the Federal Reserve has conso lidated some of its operations where the \nopportunity to improve efficiency was appa rent. Check processing is one such area. \nOthers include wire transfer s, retail electronic payments  and support activities. All \nthese actions have served to contain costs.  Yes, there is every reason to pursue co st savings when it makes sense to do so. \nCertainly repetitive processes often bene fit from new technology that simplifies \noperations.   But there is another side to consolida tion where costs can rise and performance \ncan decline. When the consolidation withdr aws authority for local decision-making, it \ncan lead to cumbersome bureaucracies, sl ower decision-maki ng and loss of local \nincentive and performance.    All consolidations involve  cost-benefit trade-offs.  Balancing the difficult-to-\nmeasure benefits of access, communicati on, broad regional representation and \noperational delivery against any hard-dollar sa vings that might come from having fewer \nbanks requires an understanding of bottom-lin e accounting and orga nizational purpose. \nIn this context, the value over the cost  of our 12-bank system is considerable. \n Finally, the value of this structure ha s been recognized by others. In 1998, the \n16-bank European Central Bank was establis hed and modeled closely to the Federal \nReserve. Like our nation’s central bank, th e ECB is responsible to a diverse population \nacross a broad region with varying economic and banking conditions. As with the Federal Reserve, a broad base of support is necessary for the ECB to succeed in its mission.  \n\n 11 Robert Bremner, in his biography of  Chairman William McChesney Martin, \nreferred to a quote which described the Fede ral Reserve System as “America’s greatest \ncontribution to the science of government.”   While this may be hyperbole, looking in the past, this structure has served us \nwell. And looking to the futu re, it is designed to last."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n     \n \n            \nOmaha, Nebraska \nJuly 19, 2006\n\n 2\n \n  It is a pleasure to be in Omaha toda y to discuss the national economic outlook and \nmonetary policy.  Over the past three year s, the U.S. economy performed very well.  \nStrong output and employment growth led to a significant drop in th e unemployment rate, \nand inflation remained relatively lo w despite higher energy costs.   \nRecently, however, we have seen increas ing signs that economic conditions are \nbecoming less favorable.  Continuing high energy  costs and rising intere st rates appear to \nbe slowing economic growth.  At the same ti me, inflationary pressures are beginning to \nemerge.  These developments have been associated with increased volatility in \ncommodity markets and in fina ncial markets around the world. \n The changing economic environment has important implications for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.  Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve has systematically \nraised its federal funds rate ta rget from 1 % to its current level of 5 ¼ %.  Over this \nperiod, as credit costs have increased, the stance of monetary policy has moved from \nbeing extremely accommodative to a setting I w ould characterize as somewhat restrictive. \n Going forward, however, the outlook for policy is much less clear, and \nuncertainty about the future policy path appe ars to be one factor behind some of the \nrecent volatility in financial markets.  Indeed, as you are aware, there is currently a lively \ndebate among financial market participants a bout whether the Fed will need to raise rates \nfurther to ward off inflationary pressure s or whether the Fed has already tightened \nsufficiently to maintain its commitment to long-run price stability and stable economic \ngrowth. \n\n 3\n In my remarks, today, I would like to provide my assessment of current economic \nconditions and the outlook for the economy in th e period ahead.  I would also like to offer \nmy perspective on the challenges facing m onetary policy in this difficult economic \nenvironment.  In this regard, I would em phasize that my views are my own and do not \nrepresent the official position of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market \nCommittee.  Current Economic Conditions\n \n Let me begin by taking a closer look at  the performance of the economy in recent \nmonths.  2006 started out on a very strong note.   First quarter GDP growth rose 5.6 %, a \nconsiderable improvement from the sluggish pace at the end of 2005.  As you may recall, \ngrowth was held down in the second half of last year by a combination of the effects of \nthe Gulf hurricanes, higher energy costs, and reduced auto incentives.  So, part of the \nsurge in growth in the first quarter was a bounce back from the economic weakness last \nyear.    Most forecasters believe that the pace of economic activity sl owed in the second \nquarter of this year to around 3 % due to  weaker consumer spending and slower \nresidential investment.  The most recent r ound of energy price increases seems to be \nhitting some consumers very hard, and the e ffects are being felt both in purchases of \nautos and other retail sales.  There is also  growing evidence that housing is slowing in \nmost parts of the country as higher interest  rates and rising home prices have reduced \naffordability.  At the national level, single family permits have declined for several \n\n 4\nmonths.  Signs of a softening housing mark et are also showing through in weaker \nhousing starts and sales of new and existi ng homes in many parts of the country. \n We are also seeing signs that hiring is slowing.  N onfarm payroll employment \naveraged 176,000 over the first three months  of the year but only 108,000 in the second \nquarter.  Much of this slowdown has been  in retail trade and construction, no doubt \nreflecting the softness in consumer spending and housing.  Amid the signs of slower growth, re cent inflation news has been somewhat \ndisturbing.  While higher energy co sts have caused broad infla tion measures to rise over \nthe past few years, most core measures of  inflation, which exclude volatile energy and \nfood prices, have remained low.  In the past  few months, however, we have seen sizeable \nincreases even in core measures of inflati on.  For example, core CPI rose 3.8 % over the \nthree months from March to May while the core PCE deflator increased 3.25 % over a \nsimilar period.   \nOne explanation for the pickup in inflat ion is that energy costs are now being \npassed through to prices of ot her goods and services to a grea ter extent than  previously.  \nWhen energy costs increased a few years ago, the lack of pass through to the general \nprice level was somewhat surpri sing.  Now the surprise seems to be going in the opposite \ndirection.   \nAlternatively, these increases could also reflect fact that the economy has been \noperating at high levels of resource utilizat ion for a period of time.  The current \nunemployment rate of 4.6 % is  below the level many economi sts believe is consistent \nwith full employment and stable prices.  And, capacity utilization has been rising in many \nindustries.  In any event, if these recent elevated inflation readings persist, they could \n\n 5\nmake it difficult for the Federal Reserve to maintain price stability over a medium-term \ntime horizon. \n \nThe Outlook and Risks to the Outlook  \n So far, I have discussed where the economy  has been and our best estimates of the \ncurrent economic situation.  From a moneta ry policy standpoint,  however, it is the \neconomic outlook over the next several quarters th at is most important in determining the \nfuture path of policy.  Let me move next to a brief discussion of the outlook and some of \nmajor risks to the outlook in the period ahead.  Many economic forecasters see somewhat slower growth continuing in the second \nhalf of this year and into 2007.  Indeed, most estimates of GDP growth over the next six \nquarters are about 3 % or sligh tly lower, which seems quite r easonable to me.  In looking \nat these numbers it is important to keep th em in perspective.  Many economists believe \nthat the U.S. economy’s potential growth ra te is around 3.25 %, so a 3 % growth rate, \nwhile somewhat below potential, may be a desirable development to keep the economy from overheating.  A more detailed look at the outlook suggest s that the major ar eas of slowing in \nmost forecasts are housing and consumer sp ending, reflecting the continuing effects of \nhigh interest rates, high energy costs, and sl ower employment growth.  In addition, weak \nhousing prices and stock pr ices could act as a drag  on consumer spending. \n Offsetting the weakness in these se ctors are healthy business investment \nspending on plant and equipment and increased exports due to strong growth in our major \ntrading partners.  Also, when we look be yond the consumer and housing sectors, there \n\n 6\nappears to be considerable strength in ma nufacturing, much of it aimed toward export \nmarkets, that is likely to pr ovide ongoing support to the economy. \n As to the outlook for inflation, most for ecasters see elevated inflation levels for \nthe next few months.  Over the longer te rm, however, slowing economic growth and a \nmoderation in energy costs are expected to put downward pressure on both overall and \ncore inflation measures.  Indeed, most forecas ters see both overall and core measures of \ninflation somewhat lower next year. \nWhile I am in general agreement with  the consensus outlook that I have \ndescribed, I recognize there are both upside ri sks to inflation and downside risks to \ngrowth.  If either should materialize, the futu re course of monetary  policy could be quite \ndifferent than we now expect.   \nAs to inflation risks, the main concern is  that inflation could stay elevated for a \nconsiderable period of time and could feed in to higher inflation exp ectations in financial \nmarkets and labor markets.  If so, the Federal Reserve might have to tighten policy \nfurther to insure that inflation expectations are contained and price stability is maintained \nover the long term.  Thus far, inflation e xpectations have remained fairly subdued, but \nthey will require continued scrutiny in coming months.  However, there is also some likeliho od that the economy could slow more than \nwe currently expect.  The la st several policy moves by th e Federal Reserve are still \nworking through the economy and may have a bigge r effect in restraining growth than we \nare forecasting.  Growth could also be w eaker if energy prices do not moderate as \nexpected.  In addition, consumers in the U. S. have been living beyond their means in \nrecent years, tapping into savings and home e quity to finance current consumption.   Any \n\n 7\nretrenchment by consumers from recent spendi ng patterns could lead to weaker economic \ngrowth.  Finally, central banks in a number of other industria lized countries are currently \ntightening policy, and slower growth abroad could limit some of the anticipated \nimprovement in U.S. exports over the next year.  Challenges for Monetary Policy\n  \nWith this discussion of the economic ou tlook as a backdrop, I would like to use \nmy remaining time today to explore the chal lenges facing monetary policy in the period \nahead.   In doing so, I am not in a position to  speculate about the futu re course of policy.  \nRather, what I hope to convey is some of my thinking about the design of monetary \npolicy strategy in the curren t economic environment.  \nAt the present time, financial markets place a fairly high probability on another \nincrease in the federal funds  rate target from 5 ¼ % to  5 ½ % at the August FOMC \nmeeting.  The downward slope to the Treasur y yield curve, however, suggests that \nmarkets believe the Federal Reserve is clos e to completing the ti ghtening cycle and is \nlikely to reduce rates somewhat over a longer time horizon. \nThe primary reason markets expect furthe r tightening in the near term is the \nexpected response of the Federal Reserve to hi gher core inflation.  Indeed, this morning’s \nrelease of the June CPI numbers is consistent with the view that inflation pressures are continuing.  The overall CPI for June was up .2 % and core CPI was up .3 %.  The June \nnumbers imply a three-month rate of 5.1 % for overall CPI and 3.6 % for core CPI and \ntwelve-month rates of 4.3 % and 2.6 % respectively. \n\n 8\nIn interpreting these inflation measures, it is helpful to keep a couple of points in \nmind.  First, monetary policy decisions are not  driven by individual data releases. Rather, \nthey depend on the implications for the economic outlook of the accumulation of data over time.  Second, monetary policy influences  inflation only with fairly long lags.  \nGenerally speaking, a change in the federal funds rate today ma y take an estimated 12 to \n18 months to affect inflation measures.  As  a consequence, monetary policy must be \nforward-looking in design. \nThe existence of lags in monetary policy has two impor tant implications.  First, \nthe Federal Reserve should only respond to hi gh current inflation to the extent that \ninflation is expected to be ve ry persistent.  Indeed, to the extent inflation pressures are \nseen as temporary and policy is currently restrictive, maintaining the current policy \nstance may be consistent with a reduction in inflation over time.  Of course, the other \naspect of this is that if inflation pressu res remain elevated, then they will affect \ninflationary expectations requiring more forceful action later.   \nSecond,  given the existence of policy lags , the actions that the Federal Reserve \ntook over the past year in moving the federal funds rate target from 3 ¼ % in June 2005 \nto 5 ¼ % last month have not yet had their full effects on the economy or inflation.  This is one reason why most forecas ters predict lower growth and inflation in the future even \nwhile current growth and in flation are quite strong. \nBased on this discussion, I believe a reasona ble case can be made that the current \nstance of monetary policy is likel y to be consistent with a reduction in inflation pressures \nover the next few quarters as energy costs mode rate and economic growth slows.  At the \nsame time, I recognize that further policy tightening could be warranted should the \n\n 9\nexpected slowing in inflation not materia lize.  As economic data accumulate over the \nnext few months, hopefully some of the curren t economic uncertainty will dissipate, and \nwe will have a clearer view of the path of monetary policy going forward.  Concluding Comments\n \n To conclude my remarks, today, I woul d like to briefly summarize my views on \nthe economic outlook and monetary policy.  My reading of the incoming data and \neconomic forecasts is that the U.S. econo my is beginning a gradual transition to a \nsomewhat slower path of economic growth.  At the same time, inflation pressures have \nrisen to the point that they cannot be easily dismissed.  In this environment, the future \ncourse of monetary policy is uncertain a nd will depend, to a large extent on how the \neconomy evolves in coming months.  In this regard, I can assure you that the Federal \nReserve will continue to maintain its commit ment to price stability and economic growth."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n           \nWichita Bankers’ Forum \nWichita, Kansas \nJune 16, 2005 \n \n \n\n 2\nIt is a pleasure to be here today and to have this opportunity to share my \nperspectives on the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy in the period \nahead.  I would like to start by noting that in my view the economy is generally healthy \nand should continue to experi ence good growth over the remai nder of this year and into \n2006.  My focus remains with the fact that, in  an environment where monetary policy has \nbeen accommodative for some time, inflationary risks may begin to rise.   \nAs I was traveling to Wichita, it occurred to me that a weather analogy might be a \ngood way to describe my message today.  As you know, the transition between spring \nand summer around here tends to be bit stor my.  In monitoring weather conditions, the \nNational Weather Service distinguishes betw een a weather “watch,” when conditions \nexist in which there is an increased risk of severe weather, and a “warning,” when severe \nweather is imminent.  In the current economic e nvironment, I believe that it is appropriate \nto issue a “watch” as conditions exist in whic h inflation pressures could build over time.  \nHowever, by taking appropriate actions to bri ng policy rates to neutral, I am reasonably \nconfident that we can avoid any such “warnings” in the future. \n In my remarks today, I would like to be gin with a brief overview of the recent \nperformance of the U.S economy and the out look for 2005 and 2006.  Then, I will take a \ncloser look at some of the ri sks to the economy.  I will close with my assessment of the \nappropriate course for U.S. monetary policy in  light of these on-going risks.  In this \nregard, I would note that I am expressing my  own views and not those of the Federal \nReserve System. \nRecent Performance of the U.S. Economy \n The U.S. economy is now in the fourth year of its recovery from the 2001 \nrecession.  Although it took some time for the r ecovery to get going, the last two years \n\n 3\nhave seen strong growth of real GDP of ar ound 4 percent, well above most estimates of \npotential growth.  Consequen tly, we have made considerab le progress in reducing the \noutput gap, and unemployment has fallen from a peak of 6.3 percent to 5.1 percent most \nrecently. \nFiscal and monetary policy have been highly accommodative during much of this \nperiod, helping to moderate the 2001 recessi on and cushion the economy from the effects \nof September 11th, the dotcom and telecom collapse, and other negative shocks to the \neconomy.  Fiscal policy provided stimulus thro ugh discretionary ta x cuts and greater \nspending for defense and homeland securit y.  And, as you know, the Federal Reserve \npushed short-term interest rates down and pr ovided additional liquid ity to the financial \nsystem.  An especially noteworthy feature of th e recovery has been the performance of \nproductivity.  Indeed, nonfarm business producti vity has averaged ove r 4 percent in the \npast three years, more than double the rate of growth from 1995 to 2000.  This surge in \nproductivity has raised potential growth and kept inflationary pressures low.  A side \neffect has been that businesses have been  able to produce more output with fewer \nworkers, and so, until recently, employment gains have been weaker than many would \nwant.  Last year, as the economy continued to strengthen and the pace of hiring finally \nbegan to pick up, the Federal Reserve bega n the process of rem oving monetary policy \naccommodation, raising the federal funds rate target from 1 percent to 2.25 percent by \nyear end.  As you know, this process has conti nued this year, and the federal funds rate \ntarget currently stands at 3 percent.  \n\n 4\nThe Outlook for 2005 and 2006  \n At the beginning of this year, most priv ate sector forecasters thought that growth \nin 2005 would be somewhat slower than the pr evious two years, largely because of a less \naccommodative monetary policy and diminishi ng stimulus from fiscal policy.  Indeed, \nmost estimates for growth of real GDP were in a range of 3.5 to 4 percent.  Forecasts \nhave been scaled back more recently as a resu lt of first quarter growth that was somewhat \nweaker than expected.  My sense is that most forecasters are now looking at growth \naround 3.5 percent (Q4/Q4) for 2005 and similar growth next year.  The major factor leading to a change in  the economic outlook this year has been \nthe unexpected strength in energy prices, wh ich has contributed to weaker consumer \nconfidence and lower spending, especially on automobiles.  There has likely been an \nadditional feedback effect through exports as higher energy costs have  reduced growth in \nmany of our trading partners. \n We have also seen the effects of highe r energy costs on measures of inflation.  \nThe May CPI numbers show overall CPI infl ation in the United States up 4.4 percent \nover the past three months and up 2.8 percent over the past year.  Of course, much of this \nincrease reflects the higher energy prices of  recent months.  Indeed, core CPI, which \nexcludes food and energy, has risen a more modest 2.2 percent over the past year.   \nOther measures of underlying inflation pre ssures also show evidence that inflation \nis picking up.  For example, a statistica lly-based, trimmed mean measure of the CPI \nconstructed at our bank shows underlying inflation up 2.5 percen t over the past year and \nup 3.2 over the past three months. This suggest s to me that energy costs are beginning to \nbe reflected in the basic costs of doing business, such as tr ansportation and utilities, and \nthese higher costs are starting to be pushed through to consumer prices. \n\n 5\nRisks to the Outlook \n   Let me turn next to a discussion of some of the major risks to the U. S. economic \noutlook.  Over the past few months, incoming da ta have raised con cerns about the near-\nterm economic outlook.  As I indicated earlier,  the initial estimate of first quarter GDP \ngrowth came in lower than expected, and othe r data pointed toward some softening in \neconomic activity in the early spring.  As a result, some analysts suggested that the \neconomy might turn out to be c onsiderably weaker th an expected.  However, first quarter \ngrowth was revised upward because of a more  favorable trade report, and recent data, \nwhile somewhat mixed, on balance do not suggest  any significant slow ing in the pace of \neconomic activity.    In the current environment, I believe it is especially important to maintain a \nlonger-term perspective on the ec onomy and look at trends rath er than reacting to highly \nvolatile, short-term data releases.  In this  regard, it is intere sting how views on the \neconomy have varied markedly in recent mont hs after the release of the employment \nreports.  First, when the March employment  numbers were weaker than expected, we \nheard concerns about a slowi ng economy.  Then, when the Ap ril employment report was \nmuch stronger than expected, these concerns  dissipated.  Finally, when the May report \nwas weaker than expected, we heard renewe d concerns about economic weakness.  From \na longer-term perspective, however, it is important to recognize that the average \nemployment gain of 180,000 in the first five months of 2005 is right in line with the \naverage monthly gain of 183,000 last year, suggesting no fundamental weakening of \nlabor markets.  \nLooking beyond the short-run volatility of  the economy, I am quite comfortable \nwith a growth forecast of 3.5 percent or some what higher over the next year and a half.  \n\n 6\nHowever, I remain alert to the potential for inflation to come in higher than expected.  \nThe source of my attention is not just the po tential for higher energy costs; there are other \nfactors as well.  Indeed, it is the confluence of  these factors that leads me to believe that \ninflation risks have increased over a longer-te rm horizon.  Let me articulate my concerns \nby highlighting three factors that may c ontribute to elevated inflation risks. \n First, the view is emerging that energy co sts, while continuing to be quite volatile, \nmay remain elevated for some considerable pe riod of time.  This is reflected in the \nbehavior of energy futures prices and in th e perception that energy supplies and refining \ncapacity may not keep up with growing world demand over an extended period of time.  If energy prices continue to fluctuate around a higher trend, they are likely to put upward \npressure on consumer prices until such tim e that the higher energy prices lead to \nincreased supply or energy conservation.  Second, going forward, businesses may f ace higher labor cost pressures, and \ndepending on competitive conditions, these costs may increasingly be passed on to \nconsumers.  Over the past three quarters, nonfarm business productivity has slowed to a 2 \npercent rate of growth.  Co mbined with higher compensation as labor market slack is \nreduced, we are starting to see rising unit labor co sts.  Indeed, the firs t quarter increase in \nunit labor costs of 4.3% over the previous year was the largest increase in over four years.  \nWhile some of this increase may reflect tr ansitory factors, such as one-time bonuses, I \nbelieve that labor costs bear incr eased scrutiny in the period ahead. \n A third factor raising infl ation risks is the behavior of prices of imported goods.  \nOver the past year, prices of non-petroleum im ports have risen 3 per cent, due at least in \npart to the depreciation of the dolla r in 2003 and 2004.  Not too many years ago, \ndeclining import prices were c ontributing to lower inflation. \n\n 7\n Taken individually, higher energy costs, increases in labor costs, and stronger \nimport prices are not especially alarming.  Ta ken together, however, they suggest to me \nan environment where the risks to inflation ar e increasingly on the upside, especially with \nan accommodative monetary policy.  Thus, going forward, I think that it will be especially important to position U.S. monetary  policy so that it can respond if inflation \npressures emerge and prevent these pressures, even if temporary, from affecting inflation \nexpectations. \nPerspectives on Monetary Policy \n In my remaining time today, I would like to offer my thoughts on the appropriate \ncourse for U.S. monetary policy in the period ahead.  While I cannot comment or \nspeculate on the specif ics of future policy actions, I hope  to provide you with a sense of \nhow I would approach this di fficult task.  My comments reflect both my view that the \noutlook for growth remains quite favorable and my view that inflation risks can be kept \nin check without significantly di sturbing this growth outlook.   \n As I indicated earlier, over the past y ear the Federal Reserve has embarked on a \ncourse of removing accommodation in the stance  of monetary policy by raising its federal \nfunds rate target from 1 percent to 3 percen t.  The two key questions now being debated \nin financial markets and the media are how much  further the target will be raised and how \nfast.  Currently, financial futures markets expe ct the target to be raised to 3.75 percent by \nyear end and then believe the FOMC will pause for several months before the next increase.  There is a somewhat greater dive rgence of opinion about next year.  Financial \nfutures markets currently expect the target to  be raised to about 4 percent next year.  \nHowever, some private sector forecasts see the target reaching 4.5 percent by the end of \n2006. \n\n 8\n In thinking about these two questions, I find it helpful to use the concept of a \n“neutral” or “equilibrium” federal funds rate .  This is the rate consistent with the \neconomy operating at full employment and with  low and stable infl ation.  This neutral \nrate can be broken down into two parts: a meas ure of the economy’s l ong-run real rate of \ninterest and a measure of long -run inflation expectations.  Generally speaking, it is hard \nto give a precise number for this neutral rate because of difficulties in estimating the real \nrate component and because of difficulties in measuring long-run inflation expectations.    \nIn the United States, most estimates of the ne utral fed funds rate fall within a range of 3.5 \nto 4.5 percent.  Using the neutral rate as a guidepost, the basic strategy of monetary policy is to \nraise the target rate above the neutral rate in response to inflati onary pressures and to \nreduce the target below the neutral rate when the economy weakens and output falls \nbelow potential.  In this fram ework, we can think of policy as being restrictive when the \ntarget is above the neutral rate and accommodative when the target is below the neutral \nrate.  Clearly, the 1 percent fed funds rate  target in May 2003 was quite accommodative \nand the current 3 percent target, while still accommodative, is much less so. \nWhile an accommodative policy is quite  appropriate when the economy is \noperating significantly below potential, I am sure you would agree th at the same policy \ncould be highly inflationary if maintained  as the economy approaches its potential.  \nIdeally, then, we would like to unwind policy accommodation in pace with the rebound in aggregate demand that moves the econ omy back toward its potential. \nIn the current circumstances, I believe th at the environment for inflation can be \nmade most stable if we continue to  remove the remain ing monetary policy \naccommodation as soon as practical.  While I am  comfortable with c ontinuing the recent \n\n 9\npattern of 25 basis point increases in the fede ral funds rate target, I would not rule out \nlarger steps if circumstances warrant.  More importantly, perhaps, I would be reluctant to \npause in this endeavor until the funds rate target is clearly within the estimated range for \nthe neutral rate.  Once the funds rate target is back within th e neutral range, I believe the \nFederal Reserve will be better positioned to  achieve its long run inflation goals while \nmaintaining the flexibility to address signs  of weaker economic activity should they \noccur. \nConcluding Comments \nLet me conclude my remarks with a brie f summary of my perspectives on the \nU.S. economic outlook and monetary policy.  The overall outlook for the U.S. economy \nfor the balance of this year and into 2006 appears quite favor able, with growth somewhat \nabove potential and improving labor market cond itions.  While I expect price pressures to \nremain moderate over the near te rm, I also believe th at there are upside ri sks to inflation.  \nIn this environment, I believe  it would be prudent for the Fe deral Reserve to continue its \nmove from an accommodative monetary policy to a more neutral stance. \n###"

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n      \n \n           \nThe Governor's 2006 Summit on Workforce Development \n \nCasper, Wyoming \nMay 16, 2006 \n \n\n 2\n \nIt’s a pleasure to be with you this evening to discuss issues surrounding the \nnation's labor force.   Recently, our economy ha s grown at a robust pace, and, as a result, \nlabor and capital resources are now at or near the point of full utiliz ation.  While inflation \nhas risen because of increased energy pri ces, outside the energy sector, inflation has \nremained well contained.  Over the same period, monetary policy has moved from a highly accommodative stance to one that today is more ne utral.  Remarkably, this \neconomic performance has occurred despit e a number of shocks to the economy, \nincluding hurricanes and cons iderable energy price volat ility.  The U.S. economy \ncontinues to demonstrate its resiliency and underlying macroeconomic strength.   \nAs I talk with business people in the Tent h District, I am hearing more reports of \nshortages of qualified workers.  This is one indication that resource utilization is \nincreasing.  In a recent survey of sma ll businesses by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, 31 percent of firms reported unfilled job openings, almost twice \nas many as reported such openings in 2003.  In addition, 13 percent of firms listed labor \nquality as their single most important pr oblem—the third-most common response behind \ntaxes and health insurance.    \nMismatches between the supply of skills  in the workforce and the demand for \nskills by employers create cha llenges for monetary policy, ma king it harder to achieve \nlow overall unemployment with stable inflati on.   But shortages in skilled workers also \nraise longer-run issues for our economic performance.  Inadequate growth in the supply \nof skilled workers can hold down our overall rate of economic growth.   In addition, \nfailure of the supply of skilled workers to keep up with the demand can worsen income \ninequality by widening the gap between skilled and unskilled wages.   \n\n 3\nShortages of qualified workers have become more common partly because \nstronger job growth has reduced the overall rate of unemployment.  But several other \nfactors may be contributing to the increased re ports of shortages.  First, firms in some \nindustries may be having more difficulty findi ng workers because the industries are being \nshunned by young people just enteri ng the labor force.  Before the 1980s, for example, \nmanufacturing was seen as a s ource of stable, high-paying jobs  with generous benefits.  \nWith frequent stories in the media about plan t closures and cuts in wages and benefits, \ncareers in manufacturing have lost some of th eir appeal to today’s youth.   In a similar \nmanner, the boom-and-bust cycle in the en ergy sector over the last three decades \ndiscouraged many young people fr om pursuing careers as oil and gas engineers or rig \nworkers. \nAnother factor that may be contributing to  the increased reports of shortages is \nthat firms are trying to fill new positions from  outside instead of tr aining their existing \nworkers.  According to this view, increased  turnover in the labor market has reduced \nfirms’ incentive to invest in job training.  Rather than bringing existing workers up to \nspeed, firms may be seeking workers who alread y have the required skills and can hit the \nground running.  If the required skills are high ly specific, such workers may be hard to \nfind. \nA final explanation for the reported shortages is that globalization and \ntechnological change are creating demands for new skills.   In U.S. manufacturing, \ncompetition from foreign companies with access to low-wage, unskilled labor is causing a shift toward higher-end products that are tec hnologically sophisticated  or tailored to the \nspecific needs of customers.  These higher- end products have increased the demand for \n\n 4\nhighly skilled factory workers at the same ti me that the supply of young people interested \nin manufacturing careers has declined. \nReported shortages of skilled workers are less common today than during the \neconomic boom of the late 1990s.  However, th ere are reasons to believe such shortages \nmay increase in the years ahead, even if the economy grows close to its potential.  One \nreason is that in some industries, a high per centage of skilled employees are in their 50s \nand close to retirement.   Two such industr ies that are important in our District are \naircraft manufacturing and oil and gas extract ion.  In 2000, the share of employees aged \n50 or older was 37 percent in aircraft ma nufacturing and 31 percent in oil and gas \nextraction, compared to 25 per cent in all industries.   \nAnother reason shortages of skilled workers may increase is that growth in \neducational attainment is proj ected to slow.  The percentage  of people aged 25 and older \nwith college degrees has increased sharpl y since World War II—from only 6 percent \nright after the war to 28 percent in 2004.   Du ring the last three decades however, most of \nthe increase in the share of college graduates has been due to the replacement of elderly \npeople who grew up during times of low college enrollment by better educated young \npeople.  Over the same period, the share of  adults aged 25 to 29 who graduated from \ncollege has increased only modestly.  If colle ge enrollment rates do not turn back upward, \ngrowth in the supply of college graduates wi ll likely fall short of growth in the demand \nfor such workers, which will continue to be boosted by technological change.  \nWhat can be done to alleviate such shortages of skilled workers?  First is to raise \ncollege enrollment in the nation.  During the la st several years, there have been some \nsigns of an increase in school attendance among people in their la te teens.  It is too soon \n\n 5\nto know, however, whether this in creased interest in school is  a temporary response to the \nslowing of the economy in the early 2000s or a longer-term trend.  At some point, further \nincreases in college enrollment will come only by raising enrollment among the nation’s \ndisadvantaged minorities, who currently lag well behind in college attendance.  For some states such as Wyoming, an additional ch allenge is to retain those young people who do \ngo on to college.  During the second half of  the 1990s, for example, Wyoming suffered a \nnet outflow of 3,800 college gra duates aged 25 and older, mo re than 5 percent of the \ntotal. \nBesides increasing the supply of college graduates in th e U.S., it is important to \nupgrade the skills of blue collar and clerical workers in the mi ddle of the job distribution.   \nOne way to do that is to devote more res ources to primary and secondary education, \nincluding vocational programs.  Another way is  to take greater a dvantage of community \ncolleges, which not only prepare local youth fo r technical careers but  also retrain older \nadults whose skills have become outdated.  Improving skills for middle-level workers is \nnot only valuable in its own ri ght but also can help states like Wyoming attract and retain \nhighly educated workers.  If Wyoming’s blue  collar and clerical wo rkers are viewed as \nhighly productive, more firms will choose to lo cate here.  And if more firms locate here, \nmore high-level jobs will be created for co llege graduates, slowing the brain drain.  \nWhile increasing the quantity of education in the United St ates is highly desirable, \nchanges in the global economy make it equally important to increase the quality  of \neducation.  The supply of highly educated wo rkers in foreign count ries has increased \ngreatly over the last three decades.  With advances in electronic communication, some \nservices that used to be produced by well-ed ucated workers in the United States now can \n\n 6\nbe provided by these highly educated workers abroad.  In the face of these changes, we \nneed to ensure that U.S. workers at all levels have the kinds of skills that allow them to do their jobs better than lower-paid workers overseas.  That means putting more emphasis \nin our educational system on creativity, pr oblem solving, and co mmunication skills.  \nMy main focus this evening has been on the need for skilled workers.  But even \nwith continued technological pr ogress, there will still be many unskilled jobs that need to \nbe performed in our economy.  For the most part, these will be jobs that require little \neducation but cannot be easily automated, such as janitorial jobs, restaurant jobs, and \ncertain construction and agricultu ral jobs.  In recent years, unskilled immigrants have \nplayed an important role in performing these jobs, and they can continue to do so in the \nfuture.   However, because the potentia l supply of unskilled workers from poorer \ncountries is so vast, it is important to bring the volume  of immigration under better \ncontrol, as Congress and the Administrati on are trying to do.  Whatever level of \nimmigration we do decide to allow in this c ountry, we also must make sure to provide \nopportunities for poorly educated immigrants to  upgrade their skills. That way unskilled \nimmigrants can eventually move on to bette r jobs, leaving the many low-end jobs that \nstill need to be performed in our economy to the next round of legal immigrants.  \n Let me conclude by saying that to ensu re favorable economic performance in the \nU.S. economy over the longer run, it is important to increase the skills  of our workforce.  \nThis will require us not only to raise colle ge enrollment in the nation but also use our \ncommunity colleges and other educational institu tions to upgrade skills in the middle of \nthe job distribution."

In the two years sin ce I last spoke at our Kansas \nCity Economic Forum, the U.S. economy has grown at a robust pace, and, as a result, labor and capital resources are now at or near the point of full utiliz ation.  While inflation \nhas risen as a result of increased energy pr ices, outside the energy sector, inflation has \nremained well contained.  Over the same period, monetary policy has moved from a highly accommodative stance to one that today is more ne utral.  Remarkably, this \nperformance of the economy has occurred de spite a number of shocks to the economy, \nincluding hurricanes and cons iderable energy price volat ility.  The U.S. economy \ncontinues to demonstrate its resiliency and underlying macroeconomic strength.   \nThis evening, I plan to review rece nt economic performance, provide my \nassessment of the near-term economic outlook a nd discuss the implications of the outlook \nfor monetary policy.   In particular, I will st art by looking back at the performance of the \nU.S. economy in 2005 and then take a look at so me of the fundamental forces that will be \nshaping the outlook in 2006.  Next, I’ll disc uss some of the risks to the outlook—both on \nthe upside and the downside.  I’ll conclude  with a brief discussion of how monetary \npolicy has contributed to the favorable perfor mance of the economy over the last year or \nso and discuss factors that wi ll influence the course of m onetary policy over the next \nseveral months.   Looking back at 2005\n \n Let me begin by taking a look back at the year just ended.  R eal gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth was weaker than expect ed in the fourth quarter of last year, \n\n 3\ngrowing at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent.   It is important to  note, though, that the \nslower growth was probably due to transitory factors.  Auto sales weakened early in the \nfourth quarter because of reduced sales in centives.  Defense spending fell sharply, which \nis unlikely to continue in the months ahead.  And, because of the hurricanes, net exports \nworsened.  In particular, exports were tem porarily depressed by the shutdown of some \nGulf ports, and imports of crude oil and ch emicals surged temporarily to replace lost \nproduction.   \nDespite the weaker-than-expected number s for the fourth quarter, the economy \ngrew at a solid pace of 3.2 percent in 2005 as a whole.  Moreover, growth was strong \nenough to further reduce the unemployment rate and raise industrial capacity use.  For \nexample, the unemployment rate fell from 5.4 percent in December 2004 to 4.9 percent in \nDecember 2005, and it has continued to fall this year to 4.8 percent in February.  In addition, capacity utilization in manuf acturing has edged up to around its long-run \naverage rate.       \n All major components of domestic dema nd contributed to this performance.  \nConsumer and business spending grew solid ly, and residential investment spending \nactually accelerated a bit relative to the pr evious year.  The only major sector not \ncontributing significantly to overall growth was the foreign trade sector, where we \ncontinued to see large an d growing deficits.   \n On the inflation front, the news was also reasonably good.  Although there was a \nsignificant impact of higher energy prices on ov erall inflation, the core inflation rate \nremained low and stable.  Over the year e nded in December, the overall consumer price \nindex (CPI) rose by 3.4 percent.  But the CP I excluding food and en ergy prices rose a \n\n 4\nmore modest 2.2 percent.  Looking at the more recent data for the 12-month period \nthrough February 2006, overall CPI rose 3.6 pe rcent, but core CPI inflation actually \ndeclined a bit to 2.1 percent.   Thus, while we have seen sh arp increases in energy prices \ncontribute to higher he adline inflation, we have not seen  these price pressures passed \nthrough to a higher core in flation rate.      \n One of the factors that contributed to the solid economic performance last year \nwas the accommodative stance of monetary po licy.  Although the Federal Open Market \nCommittee (FOMC) raised the target for the fe deral funds rate by 25 basis points at each \nof its eight meetings last year , and at both meetings so far th is year, for most of 2005, the \nrate remained below the level most analysts would describe as neutral.  A neutral funds \nrate is one that neither stimulates nor restrains overall economic activity.  Although no \none knows exactly what level of the funds rate  is consistent with neutrality, we clearly \ndid not approach the neutral range until late in 2005.  Recall that at the beginning of the \nyear, the funds rate was just 2 ¼ percent in nominal terms—and zero percent after \nadjusting for inflation.  Today, it is 4 ¾ per cent nominal and around 2 ½ percent real.  So, \nthroughout most—if not all—of 2005, mone tary policy remained accommodative.  \nLooking ahead at 2006  \nLooking ahead, I expect the favorable perf ormance of the economy to continue. \nMost private forecasters expect the momentum from the solid growth in 2005 to continue \ninto 2006.  While 2005 ended on a weak note, th at weakness was due to special factors \nthat will not likely be repeated  in 2006.  In addition, the lim ited data we have so far for \nthe first quarter of 2006 suggest a rebound is likely in the first quarter.  Consumer \nspending was strong in January, and constructio n activity actually picked up speed due to \n\n 5\nthe unusually warm weather, backing down only recently.  Labor market indicators \nsuggest continued growth in employment and a low level of unemployment.   \nAlthough monetary policy is less accomm odative, it will continue to support \neconomic activity in the near term.  Because  of the lags with which monetary policy \naffects the economy, monetary policy accommoda tion over the past year will continue to \nact as an economic stimulant in  the near term, though clearly not as much of one as in the \npast several years.  Over the second half of  this year, our moves to remove monetary \naccommodation should help ensure the economy settles into a growth rate that is consistent with the economy’s long-run growth potential.   \nMy view is similar to the c onsensus of private sector fo recasters.  I would expect \ngrowth of around 3 ½ percent (Q4/Q4) for 2006, which is just slightly above most \nestimates of trend GDP growth.  That said, gr owth in the first quarter may come in well \nabove 3 ½ percent, as the economy rebounds from  the sluggish fourth quarter.  But over \nthe course of the year, I would expect to see GDP decelerate to around its trend growth \nrate. \nAs in 2005, consumer spending is expected to be a primary contributor to growth \nin 2006.  In recent months, consumer confidence has rebounded sharply from its hurricane-related plunge last fall.  More impor tantly, consumer expectations of the future \nare positive.  Concerns about high heating cost s this winter have been mitigated to some \nextent by unseasonable warm weather, which ha s kept fuel supplies ample and costs more \nor less in check.  And these concerns shoul d diminish further this spring as heating \ndemands decline and production in the Gu lf region is more fully restored. \n\n 6\nDespite the upheavals in several sectors of the economy, such as the domestic \nauto industry, business investme nt is also expected to contribute to growth in 2006.  \nStrong growth of corporate earnings combin ed with low borrowing costs over the past \ntwo years has led to marked improvement in fi rms’ balance sheets.  In the fourth quarter \nof last year, corporate profits were 21 percent higher than th e year-earlier period.  \nLooking ahead, while there may be some slowing from recent performance, most private sector forecasters expect profit growth of  8 percent to 9 percent in 2006.  Together, \nimproved balance sheets and strong profit gr owth will provide fundamental support for \ninvestment spending. \nIn the international sector, continued str ong growth in the rest of the world will \nreduce the drag on U.S. GDP growth coming fr om net exports.  Such growth, however, is \nalso likely to increase furt her global demand for natural re sources.  This implies that \nprices for some commodities, such as oil and cement, may remain at elevated levels for \nan extended period.   \nThe solid growth forecast for the econo my also should translate into steady \ngrowth in employment.  The increases will be somewhat less than employment gains seen \nin the past two years due to tw o factors.  First, as growth slows and converges toward the \neconomy’s trend growth rate, fewer additio nal workers will be needed.  And second, \nstrong productivity growth over the past few years is expected to continue, suggesting \nthat the existing workforce will be able to  produce a sizeable portion of the projected \nincrease in output.  Based on these factors, I would expect that em ployment will grow by \n\n 7\nbetween 1.5 million and 2 million jobs in 2006.  That translates into an increase of \n125,000 to 167,000 jobs per month. \nTurning to inflation, I expect the core inflation rate to remain at about its current \nlevel.  Thus far, the impact of higher ener gy prices on the core me asure of CPI inflation \nhas been moderate.  However, I recognize that the longer energy prices remain at \nelevated levels, the greater the possibility th at these higher costs wi ll be passed on from \nproducers to consumers.  Still, for 2006, I ge nerally expect these energy price pressures \nto result in a modest increase of core infla tion in the first half of the year before \ndiminishing in the second half. Risks to the outlook\n \nLet me turn now to some of the risks to this very favorable outlook.  Despite the \nremarkable resilience of the U.S. economy to  a variety of economic shocks over the past \nseveral years, it’s important that we conti nue to remain aware of  potential problems.  \nRight now, in my view, the risks to the fa vorable outlook for inflation and growth are \nreasonably well-balanced.  While there might be a small upside risk to the inflation \noutlook, that risk is balanced by a sma ll downside risk to economic growth.   \nThe upside risk for inflation stems from two sources.  First, the increase in energy \nprices has led to increased costs for tran sporting and producing ma ny goods and services.  \nIf these higher costs of production are passed through to consumer prices, we could see a \ngreater-than-expected increase in core infl ation.  Second, if the economy expands at a \nrate faster than underlying tr end growth, the pool of availa ble workers will shrink.  Such \nexpansion could eventually resu lt in higher labor costs.  T hus far, we have yet to see \nrapid growth in wages.  Over the past year , unit labor costs have increased by about only1 \n\n 8\npercent, but they accelerated  by 3.3 percent in the fourth  quarter.  Looking forward, \nmeasures of wage pressures and total resource demands will require careful monitoring as the economy continues to grow. \nThe risk of slower-than-expected output gr owth also stems from several sources.  \nOver the past several years, as you know, ther e’s been a rapid increase in the value of \nhousing in the United States fueled by low mort gage interest rates.  This has increased \nhousehold wealth and contribu ted to strong growth in hous ehold consumption during the \ncurrent economic expansion.  But, if housing pr ices have risen above levels dictated by \neconomic fundamentals, there’s a chance prices  could fall.  With the current high debt \nlevel of consumers, such a drop in household wealth could cause them to sharply curtail \ntheir spending, leading to slower growth in  the economy.  While I don’t think there is \nmuch risk of a housing price collapse on a na tionwide basis, we could see a decline in \nprices in certain markets. \nAnother risk to output growth  is the current low savings rate in the United States.  \nFor the last three quarters of 2005, the persona l savings rate was negative.  That means \nthat personal consumption spending exceeded disposable income.  So while businesses \nhave been improving their balance sheets as a result of strong earnings growth, consumer \ndebt has been increasing.  The picture for gove rnment savings is not any better due to the \ncurrent large federal budget deficit.  Combined, strong consumer and government \ndemand have caused imports to exceed exports, resulting over time in the large U.S. trade \ndeficit, now approaching 7 percent of nomi nal GDP.  To finance this trade deficit, \nforeigners have acquired large holdings of U.S. securities.   \n\n 9\nAt some point, the domestic savings rate wi ll need to increase to reduce this trade \nimbalance.  Many economists expect that the transition to a higher sa vings rate will occur \nsmoothly, but with an imbalance of this ma gnitude, there is a chance that a rapid \ntransition could lead to a downturn in  the economy through a sharp falloff in \nconsumption.   \nTo summarize, the risks to the favorab le outlook—while present, as always—\ncurrently appear to be balanced.   A small ri sk of higher inflation is  roughly balanced by a \nsmall risk of slower output growth.  With th e economy now at or near the point of full \nutilization of resources, it will  become more challenging to  set a course for monetary \npolicy that continues to pr operly balance these risks. \nImplications for monetary policy  \n That brings me to the final part of my presentation: the role of monetary policy in \nfostering sustainable economic gr owth with price stability.  Ov er the course of the last \nyear and a half, the FOMC gradually has raised  its target for the federal funds rate from \nan unusually low level of 1 percent in 2004 to 4 ¾ percent today.  As a result of these actions, the funds rate now has returned to a more normal level and is within the range \nmost analysts would associate with neutrality.  In fact, the funds rate now may be at the \nupper end of the range I would associate with neutrality.  While this strikes me as where \nwe most likely should be, balancing inflation and output risks, we cannot know this for \ncertain.  Only as new data and anecdotal  information on the economy arrive will we \nknow how monetary policy will need to respond. \n When the funds rate was at the unusually  low level of 1 percent two years ago, it \nwas relatively easy to signal a direction for future changes in monetary policy.  As the \n\n 10\neconomy gained momentum in 2004, it was clear that the funds rate needed to increase \ngradually back to a more normal or neutral rang e.  However, as the funds rate has entered \nthe neutral range and risen to the upper end of  that range as estimated by most analysts, it \nhas become more difficult to know in advance wh at the next move is likely to be or when \nthe next move should occur.   Currently, as I have described, the economy is operating at or near full resource \nutilization, output is projected to grow at roughly the economy’s growth potential over \nthe course of the year, and core inflation is pr ojected to remain relatively low and stable.  \nIn addition, the risks to the outlook are balan ced, and the funds rate has returned to a \nmore normal level.   \nGiven lags in the effects of monetary  policy on the economy, however, we cannot \nbe sure how our past policy actions w ill impact the economy down the road.  We \ntherefore will need to carefully  examine incoming data for signs  of inflationary pressure \nor economic weakness and be prepared to take appropriate action.  Because economic \ndata often give ambiguous signals, we must  go cautiously, watching the new information \nto confirm where we are in the current econom ic and policy cycle and that we not tighten \npolicy too much, thus, needlessly slowing the economy below potential.  That said, \nbalance requires that long-run inflation e xpectations remain well anchored if price \nstability is to be maintained. Conclusion\n \n Let me conclude by saying that I expect we will continue to  enjoy solid economic \ngrowth with low inflation throughout 2006.  Out put likely will grow at or slightly above \nthe economy’s long-run growth potential.  With the possibility of increased resource \n\n 11\nutilization and the pass-though of higher energy pr ices to core infla tion, there is a risk \nthat inflationary pressures c ould build.  At the same time , there are also risks—though \nperhaps small—that a decline in  housing prices or a disorderly adjustment to our trade \nimbalance could cause a pullback in consumer  spending.  In this environment, we will \nneed to carefully monitor incoming data and ta ke necessary actions to  keep the risks to \nthe attainment of both sustainable economi c growth and price stability roughly in \nbalance."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n      \n \n             \nKansas City, Missouri \nJanuary 9, 2006 \n\n 2\n  \n \nI’m pleased to be back at the Centra l Exchange to speak  with you about the \noutlook for 2006 and implications for monetary policy.  With the start of the New Year, \nit’s a particularly opportune time to reflect on the past year and to anticipate the \nopportunities and challenges that the current year  might bring.  Some  of you might recall \nthat I spoke here a year a go, providing my perspective on the U.S. economy for 2005.  \nFortunately, last year, my crystal ball proved reliable, and the year unfolded largely as I \nexpected.   \nToday, I would like to review the perfo rmance of the economy in 2005 and take a \nlook at some of the fundamental forces that  will be shaping the outlook in 2006.  I also \nwould like to give you my perspective on m onetary policy over the period ahead.  I \nhope—but can’t guarantee—that my crystal ball will prove as reli able this year as it did \nlast year.   \nLooking back at 2005  \n Let me begin by taking a look back at th e year just ended.  While we don’t yet \nhave GDP data for the fourth quarter, it a ppears the economy experienced solid growth \nthroughout the year.  In the firs t three quarters of the year, th e economy grew at an annual \nrate of 3.7 percent.  This strong growth—which  is above most estimates of the economy’s \nlong-run growth potential—largely closed th e output gap and retu rned the economy close \nto full resource utilization.  Fo r example, the unemployment rate fell from 5.4 percent in \nDecember of 2004 to 4.9 percent in December of  last year, and capaci ty utilization in \nmanufacturing edged up.  This growth rate was also close to the forecast of 3½ to 4 \npercent that I gave here last year. \n\n 3\n All major components of domestic dema nd contributed to this performance.  \nConsumer and business spending remained r obust, and residential investment spending \nactually accelerated a bit relative to the pr evious year.  The only major sector not \ncontributing significantly to overall growth was the foreign trade sector, where we \ncontinued to see large deficits .  But, depending on what ha ppened in the fourth quarter, \neven that sector likely has been less of a drag on growth than in previous years.  \n On the inflation front, the news was also reasonably good.  Although there was a \nsignificant impact of higher energy prices on ov erall inflation, the core inflation rate \nremained relatively low and stable.  On a y ear-over-year basis, the overall CPI rose by \n3½ percent in November of last year.  But, the CPI excluding food and energy prices rose \na more modest 2.1 percent.   This outcome was consistent with what I expected last year \nat this time.  Although last year I mentioned a number of factors that made me cautious \nabout the outlook for inflation, my expectati on was that core inflation would remain \nstable. \n Now, before I get carried away with my forecasting ability, let me acknowledge \nthat last year I obviously was not anticipati ng the disruption to economic activity caused \nby hurricanes Katrina and Rita or the spike in energy prices they prec ipitated.  Indeed, the \nlong-run outlook for oil and gas prices has change d dramatically since this time last year.  \nHad the hurricanes not struck, I suspect economic growth might have come in even \nstronger than I was anticipating last year, and, certainly, overall in flation would have \ncome in lower.  One of the factors that contributed to the solid economic performance last year \nwas the accommodative stance of monetary po licy.  Although the Federal Open Market \n\n 4\nCommittee (FOMC) raised the target for the fe deral funds rate by 25 basis points at each \nof our eight meetings last year, for most of  the year, the rate remained below the level \nmost analysts would describe as neutral.  A neutral funds rate is one that neither over-\nstimulates nor restrains overall economic activity.  Although no one knows exactly what \nlevel of the funds rate is consistent with  neutrality, we clearly did not approach the \nneutral range until late in 2005.  Recall that at the beginning of the year, the funds rate \nwas just 2¼ percent in nominal terms and zer o percent after adjusting for inflation.  \nToday, it is 4¼ percent in nominal terms a nd just over 2 percent after inflation. So, \nthroughout most—if not all—of 2005, mone tary policy remained accommodative.  \nLooking ahead at 2006  \nLooking ahead, I expect the favorable perf ormance of the economy to continue. \nMost private forecasters expect the momentum from the solid growth in 2005 to continue \ninto 2006.  Although monetary policy has beco me less accommodative, it will continue to \nsupport economic activity.  Because of the lags  with which monetary policy affects the \neconomy, monetary policy accommodation over the past year will continue to act as an \neconomic stimulant, though clearly far less so than  in the past several years.  My sense is \nthat most forecasters expect growth of around 3½ percent (Q4/Q4) for 2006, which is just slightly above most estimates of trend GDP growth.  My own view is that we will see \ngrowth in the 3¼ to 3½ per cent range, which encompasses the consensus estimate. \nAs in 2005, consumer spending is expected to be a primary contributor to growth \nin 2006.  In recent months, consumer confidence measures have sharply rebounded from the hurricane-related decline last fall.  More  importantly, consumer expectations of the \nfuture are positive.  One possible drag on c onsumption lies in the persistence of high \n\n 5\nenergy prices, especially for na tural gas.  High utility prices  for heating are expected to \nconstrain spending somewhat dur ing the winter months.  Th is drag should diminish by \nspring as heating demands decline and production in the Gulf region is more fully restored.  Overall, I expect to see co nsumption growth of around 3 percent for 2006. \nDespite the upheavals in several sector s of the economy, such as the auto \nindustry, business investment is also expected to contribute to growth in 2006.  Strong \ngrowth of corporate earnings  combined with low borrowing costs over the past two years \nhave led to marked improvement in firms’ ba lance sheets.  In the first three quarters of \n2005, corporate profits were nearly 15 per cent higher than the year-earlier period.  \nLooking ahead, while there may be some slowing from recent performance, most private sector forecasters expect profit growth of  around 8 percent in 2006.  Together, improved \nbalance sheets and strong pr ofit growth will provide fundamental support for investment \nspending. \nIn the international sector, continued str ong growth in the rest of the world will \nslow the growth of the trade deficit. An  expanding world economy is expected by many \neconomists to generate increasing demand for U.S. exports.  Such growth, however, is \nalso likely to further incr ease global demand for natural re sources.  This implies that \nprices for commodities such as oil may remain at elevated levels for an extended period. \nThe solid growth forecast for the econo my also should translate into steady \ngrowth in employment.  The increases will be somewhat less than employment gains seen \nin the past two years due to tw o factors.  First, as growth slows and converges toward the \neconomy’s trend growth rate, fewer additio nal workers will be needed.  And second, \nstrong productivity growth over the past few years is expected to continue, suggesting \n\n 6\nthat the existing workforce will be able to  produce a sizeable portion of the projected \nincrease in output.  Based on these factors,  I would expect that employment will grow \nbetween 1.5 and 2 million in 2006. \nTurning to inflation, I expect the core inflation rate to remain low. Thus far, the \nimpact of higher energy prices on the core m easure of CPI inflation has been moderate.  \nHowever, the longer energy prices remain at elevated levels, the gr eater the pr obability \nthat these higher costs will be passed on from producers to consumers.  For 2006, I \nexpect these energy price pressures to result in  a modest increase of core inflation in the \nfirst half of the year before diminishing in the second half. \nRisks to the outlook  \nWith the general performance of the econom y outlined, let me next discuss what I \nsee as the major risks for the U.S economi c outlook.  Over the past year, the economy \nagain has displayed its resilience to econom ic shocks.  In first half of 2005, we \nexperienced a sharp run-up in energy prices.  In the second half, we faced the devastating \nimpacts of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, whic h led to an additiona l increase in energy \nprices.  Throughout these ev ents, the economy has continued its robust growth, and \nrelated inflation pressures appear to have  been temporary.  Despite the excellent \nperformance of the economy in the wake of th ese events, it is important that we continue \nto be on the lookout for pot ential problems ahead. \nThe primary near-term concern pertains to  the upside risks for the economy and \ninflation.  If global demand continues to  accelerate, total resource demands could \nincrease as well.  As mentioned earlier, the in crease in energy prices may lead to higher \ncore inflation if higher ener gy costs are passed on by businesses to consumers.  In \n\n 7\naddition, if the U.S. economy continues expandi ng at a rate faster than underlying trend \ngrowth, the pool of available workers will sh rink.  Such expansion eventually should \nresult in higher labor costs.  Thus far, we ha ve yet to see rapid growth in wages.  Over the \npast year, unit labor costs have increase d by only 2 percent.  But looking forward, \nmeasures of wage pressures and total resource demands will require careful monitoring as the economy continues to grow. \nA second, longer-term concern relates to the current low savings rate in the \nUnited States.  For seven of the past eight months, the personal savings rate has been \nnegative.  So while businesses have been im proving their balance sheets as a result of \nstrong earnings growth, consumer debt has b een increasing as consumers have spent in \nexcess of their incomes.  The picture for gove rnment savings is not any better due to the \ncurrent large federal budget deficit.  Combined, strong consumer and government \ndemand have caused imports to exceed exports, resulting over time in the large U.S. trade \ndeficit.  To finance this trad e deficit, foreigners have ac quired large holdings of U.S. \nsecurities.  At some point, the domestic savi ngs rate must increase to reduce this trade \nimbalance.  Many economists expect that the transition to a higher sa vings rate will occur \nsmoothly, but with an imbalance of this magni tude, there is the low probability that a \nrapid transition could lead to a downturn in the economy through a sharp falloff in \nconsumption. \nA third concern relates to a possible imba lance in asset prices.  Over the past \nseveral years, there has been a rapid increase  in the value of housing in the United States \nfueled by low mortgage interest rates.  This has increased household wealth and \ncontributed to strong growth in househol d consumption during the current economic \n\n 8\nexpansion.  If housing prices have risen above levels dictated by economic fundamentals, \nthere is a chance that prices could fall.  W ith the current low savings rate and high debt \nlevel of consumers, such a drop in househol d wealth would have negative implications \nfor the economy.  While I do not think there is  much risk of a si gnificant housing price \ndecline on a nationwide basis, we could see a decline in pr ices in certain markets. \nThese three factors present both upside and downside risks to the economy.  As \nthe economy nears the point of full utiliza tion of resources, it will become more \nchallenging to set a course for monetary polic y that appropriately ba lances these risks. \nImplications for monetary policy  \n That brings me to the final part of my presentation: the role of monetary policy in \nfostering sustainable economic gr owth with price stability.  Ov er the course of the last \nyear and a half, the FOMC gradually has raised  its target for the federal funds rate from \nan unusually low level of 1 percent in 2004 to  4¼ percent today.  As a result of these \nactions, the funds rate now has returned to a more normal level and is within at least the \nlower range of what most analysts associate with neutrality.  Whet her the funds rate is \nnow precisely at the point within the neutral range where it needs to  be is a question I \ncannot answer with any degree of certainty.  This depends on possible increases in \nresource utilization as well as elevated en ergy prices, and whether other factors add to \ninflation pressures.  More generally, when the funds  rate is within the neutra l range, as I believe it is \nnow, changes in the funds ra te target become more dependent on incoming economic \ndata and on anecdotal information on economic activity and inflation.  If such evidence \nwere to suggest that core in flation was increasing above the level associated with price \n\n 9\nstability, it might be necessary to move the f unds rate target higher within the range of \nneutrality.  Or, depending on the extent of upward price pressure , it might be necessary to \nmove the funds rate above the neutral range to offset the tendency for inflation to rise.  \nOne indicator that would be of particular c oncern to me would be any upward movement \nin long-run inflation expectations.  It is e ssential for long-run infl ation expectations to \nremain well anchored if price stability is to be maintained.  In contrast, if incoming evidence sugges ted the expansion were faltering, it might \nbe necessary to adjust the funds rate downwar d.   As I suggested earlier, the burden of \nhigh energy prices or a desire  by consumers to curtail thei r spending could lead to a \nslower-growth scenario.  Depending on the outlo ok for inflation in such a scenario, it \nmight be appropriate to move the funds rate lower within th e neutral range or, potentially, \nbelow neutral to help stimulate spending and production.   On balance, while the current setting of  monetary policy may be close to where it \nwill ultimately need to be, we won’t know this  until new data are reported.  The point is \nthat we still must monitor closely incoming in formation as we seek to calibrate our policy \nin the months ahead.   Conclusion\n \n Let me conclude by saying that I expect we will continue to  enjoy solid economic \ngrowth with low inflation throughout 2006.  Out put will likely grow at  or slightly above \nthe economy’s long-run growth potential.  With the possibility of increased resource utilization and the pass-though of higher energy pr ices to core infla tion, there is a risk \nthat inflationary pressures could build.  In this environment, we will need to monitor \n\n 10\ncarefully incoming data and take  necessary actions to keep the risks to the attainment of \nboth sustainable economic growth and pr ice stability roughly in balance."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n     \n \n              \nCasper, Wyoming \nOctober 5, 2005 \n\n \n 2\n \n  I appreciate the opportunity  to speak with you today about my views on monetary \npolicy and the economic outlook.  In the past  month, much of our attention has been \nfocused on hurricanes – first Hurricane Katrin a and now Hurricane Rita.  With regard to \nKatrina, we have seen both the vast human suffering caused by this storm and the \ntremendous disruption to the regional economy.  In the coming days, we will learn more about the destruction caused by Hurricane R ita.  Fortunately, it appears that the \nevacuation efforts in preparation for Rita have dramatically limited the loss of life \nresulting from this catastrophic storm.    The combined impact of these storms on the national economy is difficult to gauge.  The United States has not faced su ch a large displacement of people and \nbusinesses in recent times, so we have very little experience to draw upon in terms of \nestimating the precise impact on the regional  and national economy.  In coming months, \ndata will be closely monitore d to assess how quickly the a ffected regions are rebuilding \nand how the hurricanes’ impact is  being felt around the country.   \n Despite the uncertainties that exist, I be lieve that these unfortunate events do not \npose a persistent threat to national economic activity.  My overall assessment is that the national economy, while not without challenge s, is in reasonably good shape and that \nconditions should allow for solid growth in the fu ture.  In this context, I believe that the \nFederal Reserve should continue to focus on having a neutral monetary policy which \nreflects its commitment to price stability.  In my remarks today, I would like to be gin with a brief overview of the recent \nperformance of the U.S. economy.  Then, I wi ll discuss the outlook for the remainder of \n\n \n 3\n2005 and 2006 and address some of the risk s to the economy.  I will conclude by \nproviding my assessment of the appropriate c ourse for U.S. monetary policy, given the \nlikely economic impact of Hurricanes Katrin a and Rita and the other risks to the \neconomy.  In this regard, I would note that I am expressing my own views and not those \nof the Federal Reserve System. \nRecent Performance of the U.S. Economy \n The U.S. economy has experienced solid gr owth in the past two and a half years, \nfollowing a slow initial recovery from the 2001 recession.  In 2003 and 2004, real GDP \ngrowth averaged just under 4 percent, and gr owth in the first half of this year was 3.5 \npercent.  This strong growth, which was above  most estimates of potential growth, has \nled to a gradual reduction in  the output gap.  This reduction can be seen through the \ndecline of the unemployment rate, which has fa llen from a peak of 6.3 percent in 2001 to \n4.9 percent today.   \n Throughout much of this period, fiscal  and monetary policy have provided \nstimulus to the economy.  Federal tax cuts le d to more disposable income for households \nand increased consumer spending.  Increased spending for defense and homeland security \ncontributed to higher demand fo r goods and services.  And finally, monetary policy was \neased considerably to aid the economic re covery and limit the economic effects of \nSeptember 11th. \n Despite these two sources of stimulus, the current economic recovery took longer \nto gain momentum than past recoveries.  In part, this delayed recovery was due to \ncautious behavior on the part of businesse s.  Spending on business fixed investment, \nwhich had grown rapidly in the late 1990s, d eclined in real terms during the first two \n\n \n 4\nyears of the recovery.  And as economic gr owth returned, firms found that they could \nmeet the increased demand for goods and services without hiring additional workers.  This resulted in strong gains to  productivity, which is an im portant source of long-term \ngrowth for the economy, but it meant that employment gains were weaker than in prior recoveries.  As solid employment growth returned la st year, the Federal Reserve began the \nprocess of gradually removing policy accommodation.  Monetary policy has been shifted toward a more neutral position as the federal funds target ra te has been slowly raised \nfrom 1 percent to its current level of 3.75 percent.   \nOutlook before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n What about the outlook for the rest of th is year and 2006?  Given the uncertainties \nfor the economy raised by the destructive impa ct of Hurricanes Katr ina and Rita, let me \nstart by discussing the outlook pr ior to these hurricanes.  Befo re Katrina, most private \nsector forecasts indicated that growth in  the second half of 2005 would be above 3.5 \npercent, slowing only slightly  in 2006.  This represents slower growth than in the \npreceding years, in part a result of less stim ulus from fiscal and monetary policy.  But \nstill, solid employment gains were projecte d to continue, and business investment was \nexpected to remain strong.  Even before Katrina, one of the leading concerns for the economic outlook this year has been the impact of higher energy pri ces.  The price of oil had increased by over \n50 percent this year while the natural gas pri ce had increased by nearly 60 percent.  Here \nin Wyoming, natural gas and oil price incr eases are good news for many businesses, but \nunfortunately, that is not the case in the rest of the country.   \n\n \n 5\n The impact of energy prices is nega tive for both U.S. economic growth and \ninflation.  Higher energy prices cause consumer s to spend a greater share of their income \non gasoline and natural gas.  As a result, le ss income is available for other purchases, \npotentially leading to a decrease in overall  demand for goods and services.  And since oil \nprices have increased worldwide, foreign dema nd for U.S. exports is likely to suffer as \nwell.   Higher energy prices have also contributed to inflation pressure s.  The overall CPI \ninflation rate over the past 12 months was 3.6 percent, up from 2.7 percent a year ago.  \nThus far, the impact of higher energy prices  on the core measure of CPI inflation, which \nexcludes food and energy, has been moderate.  This narrower measure of inflation was \n2.2 percent over the past year, up from 1.7 percent a year ago. \nEconomic Effects of Hurri canes Katrina and Rita \n How have the recent hurricanes affected this outlook?  In estimating the damage \ncaused by a natural disaster, economists tend to make predictions based on the impact of \nsimilar events in the past.  In the case of Ka trina, there is no clear precedent that applies, \ngiven the scale of the destruc tion.  The immediate impact w ill stem from the loss of life \nand the destruction of businesses and homes.   The disruption in economic activity will \nlead to a slowdown in growth.  Most forecaste rs have lowered their growth estimates for \nthe second half of 2005 by about one half of a percentage po int.  In addition, there will \nlikely be a significant decrease in employment as a result of the displaced workers and \nbusinesses.  In the case of Hurricane Rita, it is too early to offer a full assessment, but it \nappears that the damage, while  significant, will not be  on the scale of Katrina. \n In the affected regions, the disruptio n of economic activity primarily will be \n\n \n 6\ntemporary.  As the focus of efforts turns fr om clean-up to rebuilding, it is likely that \ngrowth in 2006 will strengthen.  The fe deral government has already committed $60 \nbillion to the Katrina recovery efforts, a nd some estimates project that total federal \nexpenditures will exceed $200 billi on over the next year.  This is in addition to rebuilding \nbased on insurance payments – predicted to be in the range of $40 billion to $60 billion.  \nGiven the magnitude of the destruction, it is likely that the rebuildi ng effort will take \nseveral years to complete, providing a long-la sting added stimulus to growth in the \neconomy.  It is unclear at this point what type  of rebuilding efforts will be needed in the \nRita-affected region. \nConcerns for the Outlook \n Let me next discuss what I see as the major concern for the U.S. economic \noutlook.  For the past two and a half years,  the economy has grown at an above-trend \nrate, inflation pressures have been reas onably well contained, and monetary policy \naccommodation has been gradually removed over the past year as economic slack has \ndissipated.  Growth going forwar d is expected to remain sound despite some near-term \nslowdown caused by the impact of the hurricanes .  The primary concern for the outlook is \nthat higher costs may lead to greater inflation pressures.  As mentioned earlier, let me first addr ess rising energy costs for oil and natural \ngas.  The impact of an increas e in the price level is a tempor ary boost to inflation.  So far \nthis year, we have seen only modest pa ssthrough of energy price increases into core \ninflation this year.  The pri ce of oil surged even higher fo llowing Katrina’s arrival, but \nsubsequently fell to pre-Katrina levels.  In response to Hurricane Rita, the oil price has \nincreased again, but only modes tly.  The more important effect  from the hurricanes is that \n\n \n 7\nthe oil price is much less likely to decr ease over the next six months due to the \ndisruptions in oil production in  the Gulf Coast region.  If the oil price remains high in \ncoming months or increases further, then th ere is an increased concern for higher core \ninflation.  The hurricanes appear to be having a larg er effect on natural gas market. Since the \nbeginning of 2005, we have seen a large increase in the price for natural gas.  As a result \nof the two hurricanes, the pric e has risen even further.  A higher natural gas price will \nlead to higher heating costs for consumers this winter and may also lead to higher \nelectricity rates in regions that rely heavily on natural-gas-fired electricity plants.  For businesses, the costs of energy and transportation will likely increase, and firms will likely pass some of the higher costs on to cu stomers in the form of higher prices.   \n In addition to energy prices, a second possi ble inflation concern is that labor costs \nmay increase for firms as the pool of available workers continues to shrink.  Thus far in \nthe current economic expansion, firms have  benefited from strong increases in \nproductivity that have allowed them to offe r higher wages to workers without affecting \ntheir profitability.  But as the labor market has tightened and as productivity growth has \nslowed, further efforts to expand may result in faster wage growth.  In the past year, unit \nlabor costs have increased over 4 percent, th e fastest increase since 2000.  Over the past \nthree years, unit labor costs have increased at  a historically slow pace, so the current \nincrease is not an immediate source of alar m, but wage pressures will require careful \nmonitoring going forward.  A third inflation concern relates to pr ices of raw materials.  The massive \nrebuilding effort from Hurricanes Katrina a nd Rita will lead to a strong increase in \n\n \n 8\ndemand for construction materials.  While it is likely that the impact on raw materials \nprices will only be temporary in nature, the sh eer scale of the recons truction could lead to \nhigher demand for several years.  Already, prices of lumber, cement, and roofing \nmaterials have increased sharply.  For cement,  most states had alre ady been experiencing \na shortage before Katrina hit, and pri ce increases are likely in coming months. \n Thus far in the current economic recovery, inflation pressures have remained mostly contained.  By themselves, none of the sources of concern just mentioned is likely \nto lead to a strong inflationary response in the near term.  The c oncern is that in an \nenvironment in which monetary policy ha s been accommodative, the joint effect of \nseveral inflationary pressures could erode pri ce stability.  The FOMC will need to be alert \nand diligent as it works to main tain future price stability.   \nPerspectives on Monetary Policy \n I would like to spend my remaining ti me offering my thoughts on the appropriate \nresponse of monetary policy to large-scale disasters, such as the impact of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita.  But first let me take a mo ment to tell you a little about the other ways \nthat the Federal Reserve has responded to th ese crises.  Hurricane Katrina had a direct \nimpact on the Federal Reserve in New Orlean s, where a branch office of the Federal \nReserve Bank of Atlanta is located.  Like all other businesses in the city, this branch was \nclosed as result of the storm.  One of the important roles of this branch is to provide cash \nand check processing services to the area.  As  a result of its closure, nearby branches in \nBirmingham, Memphis, Houston, and Jacksonv ille have quickly stepped up to provide \nthe services needed to keep the financ ial system operating smoothly.  The Federal \nReserve System has also joined with othe r government financial agencies to help \n\n \n 9\nfacilitate the recovery of the banking system in  the affected areas and to ensure that the \nfinancial needs of consumers and businesses in the region are being met.  With regard to \nRita, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas esta blished a comprehensive contingency plan \nto ensure that cash and check processing servic es are provided with as little disruption as \npossible.  Regarding monetary policy, the obvious question is what is the appropriate \nresponse to this type of event?  Can moneta ry policy assist with the recovery from a \nlarge-scale disaster?  Or ar e other government responses better suited for aiding in \nrecovery?  There are three key distinctions to be  made in determining whether monetary \npolicy can provide a useful response to a large- scale event.  First, it must be determined \nwhether the impact will be regional or nationa l in nature.  Monetary policy’s effects are \nnational in scale.  It is unable to direct assistance to a single region without having an \neffect on the rest of the country.  In the case of the hurricanes, the la rgest impact is likely \nto be of a regional nature:  the need to re build businesses, homes,  and infrastructure along \nthe affected Gulf Coast regions.  If moneta ry policy was redirected to provide more \naccommodation to the rebuilding efforts, such po licy could lead to excessive stimulus in \nthe rest of the country.  The overall result w ould likely be an economic boom and rising \ninflation.    The national implications for the hurri canes come through the impact on energy \nprices and the shipping industry.  Both of these impacts can be viewed as negative supply \nshocks, which monetary policy cannot easily address.  A negative supply shock leads to \nhigher prices and decreased demand for goods and services.  As we have learned from the \n\n \n 10\nexperience of the 1970s, a more accommodative m onetary policy that attempts to offset \ndecreased demand during a negative supply shoc k leads to higher infl ation that can be \nvery costly to remove in the future.    The second distinction is the time frame in which assistance is needed.  In most \ncircumstances, monetary policy can only pr ovide assistance with a long lag.  Most \neconomists estimate that the time lag between  a monetary policy ac tion and its impact on \nthe economy is six to nine months.  In the ca se of the hurricanes, the negative effects are \nmost likely to be felt over the next six months .  If monetary policy were to increase the \nlevel of accommodation, the benefits would not likely be felt until next year.  By that \ntime, the rebuilding effort would be well underway, and there might be a danger that \nmonetary policy stimulus could combine with the sizeable fiscal stimulus to overheat the \neconomy and lead to higher inflation.  The third distinction is the condition of the overall economy relative to the \naffected region.  If the economy is in a recession or early in a recovery phase, the arrival \nof a regional disaster could be sufficient to  worsen conditions or  at least prolong the \nperiod of slow growth.  In such circumstances , monetary policy is likely to already be \naccommodative, so some additional accommodation may be warranted based on the economy’s fragile state.  In the current s ituation, the national economy has been growing \nstrongly for two and a half years, and m onetary policy has been gradually removing \naccommodation.  Given the positive momentum of the economy, it is much less likely \nthat a regional shock will have an overall negative impact.  And should additional policy \naccommodation be added, there is a much gr eater chance that the economy will overheat \nand result in strong inflationary pressures.   \n\n \n 11\n But this discussion is not meant to imply that monetary policy should never \nrespond to regional disasters.  In  the wake of the September 11th attacks four years ago, \nthe FOMC lowered the federal funds target rate  by 50 basis points just six days after the \nevent.  In that situation, th e distinctions I mentioned earlie r all pointed toward the need \nfor a policy response.    First, while the September 11\nth attack affected a much smaller geographic area \nthan Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the potenti al for a national impact was greater.  The \nattack disrupted services in the financial area of New York that serves as the hub of \nfinancial markets for the United States.  It disrupted payments across the country.  In \naddition, as a foreign attack on U.S. soil, this event had a sign ificant psychological \nimpact on all Americans.  It was unclear how  Americans would res pond to the events and \nhow such responses would affect the economy.   Second, as lender of last resort, the Fede ral Reserve was the best organization to \nprovide assistance to the fina ncial system.  While monetary  policy affects most of the \neconomy with a significant lag, changes in the federal funds target rate can have an \nimmediate effect on financial markets.  By  greatly increasing the amount of reserves \navailable to financial markets, the Federal Re serve was able to provi de liquidity and near-\nterm stability in a time of crisis.    And third, at the time of the attacks, the economy was very slowly emerging from \nrecession.  In the year leading up to the even t, monetary policy had been increasingly \naccommodative.  Given the fragile state of  the economy, the downside risks to the \neconomy were viewed as much greater th an the upside risks, so additional \naccommodation was viewed as the appropriate response. \n\n \n 12\n Considering all possible policy response s, most economists would argue that \nfiscal policy is more suited to assist with disasters such as a hurricane.  With a regional \ncrisis, the federal government can direct resour ces to the areas affected.  In addition, the \ngovernment response can be accomplished much more quickly than that of monetary policy.  For example, within two weeks of Katrina’s arrival, the federal government \nallocated $60 billion to aid in the recovery of the region.  And fina lly, the ability of the \ngovernment to direct aid toward a specific re gion reduces the extent of excessive stimulus \nto the rest of the country. \nConcluding Comments \n To conclude, let me provide a brief su mmary of my view of the U.S. economic \noutlook and monetary policy.  Th e overall outlook for the eco nomy for the remainder of \nthis year and 2006 is good.  Considerable ti me will be required for the recovery from \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, but I currently expect that the storms’ impact on economic \ngrowth will be limited.  In the next six months , I expect growth will be somewhat slower \ndue to the disruption of business activity. In  2006, the rebuilding effo rts in the affected \nGulf regions could add overall stimulus to grow th.  I believe that the greatest concern for \nthe outlook is the potential for inflationary  pressures to emerge.  Currently, these \npressures appear to be modest, but they will need to be carefully monitored going forward."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n                  \nNorthern Colorado Summit on National Economic Issues \nLoveland, Colorado \nSeptember 15, 2005  \n \n \n\n 2\n It is a pleasure to be in Loveland toda y to participate in this forum on national \neconomic issues.  The focus of my remarks today is “globalizati on,” the growing trade \nand financial linkages among nations that are reshaping the world economy.  Although \nthe rhetoric about globalization is often political in nature, I believe it is important to \nrecognize that the forces behi nd globalization are fundament ally about economics and, \nmoreover, have been with us for a very long time.   \nIn the 13th century, long before President Ni xon reestablished economic linkages \nwith China, Marco Polo traveled the Silk Road, opening the trade doors between the East \nand West and opening the world’s eyes to the benefits of glob al trade.  What has changed \nrecently is the pace of globalization and the rapid increase in the size of trade and \nfinancial flows in the world economy.  It took Marco Polo years to reach Beijing from Venice and to return.  Today, while Loveland is still 6,319 miles from Beijing, Colorado businesses are now only a mouse-click away from their customers and competitors in \nChina and other parts of the world. \nIn my remarks today, I would like to be gin by exploring some of the important \ndimensions of globalization and also put recent trends in historical context.  Then, I will \ntake a closer look at the economic benefits and costs associated w ith globalization that \nunderlie the public debate over globalization.  Finally, I will discuss what policies can \nhelp ensure that we take full advantage of the benefits of globalization while minimizing \nits adverse consequences. \nTHE SIGNIFICANCE AND SHIFTING  NATURE OF GLOBALIZATION \nOver the past several decades, we have seen enormous growth in world trade, \nboth in terms of the volume of trade and in th e variety of products.  We have also seen \n\n 3\nsignificant shifts in our major trading partners .  Even more remarkable is the growth in \nglobal financial markets and cross-border trading of financial assets.  Behind the \nincreased pace of globalization are a reduction in political and economic barriers to trade \nand the revolution in informati on and telecommunications technology. \nThe importance of international trade to  the U.S. economy has grown steadily, \nfrom 6½ percent of GDP in 1945 to 25 percen t last year.  Trade between nations is \nequally important for the worl d’s economy.  In 1940, world trade accounted for 7 percent \nof world GDP; today it accounts for 30 percent. \n Not only has it gained in importance, but the types of goods we trade have \nchanged.  Since World War II, our exports of g oods has declined from 84 percent of total \nexports to 78 percent more recently while our exports of services has grown from 16 \npercent of total exports to 22 percent.  And, you may not realize it, but we are actually \nrunning a trade balance surplus in services.1  To a large extent, this reflects the growing \nimportance of “other private services,” whic h includes financial, business, professional, \nand technical services.  This change is not surprising since we are increasingly a service \neconomy where service sector jobs account  for approximately 83 percent of nonfarm \nemployment.   \nWe have also seen a change in our ma jor trading partners.  Following World War \nII, half of our top 10 trading partners were from Latin Amer ica.  In this century, only \n                                                 \n1 For example, the balance of trade in services was 0.46 percent of GDP in 2004 and 0.21 percent of GDP \nduring the period 1945 – 2004.  In contrast, the balance of trade in goods was -5.78 percent in 2004 and -\n0.78 percent during the period 1945 – 2004. \n\n 4\nMexico is still in that group.   Following Wo rld War II, there were no Asian economies in \nthe top 10.  Today, there are four.2   \nIn addition to international markets for tr ading goods and services, we also have \ninternational markets for trading financial assets .  In fact, a larger share of global saving \nis now being invested in foreign countries than  ever before.  In other words, more of our \nsavings is invested in foreign economies, and mo re foreign savings is invested in the U.S. \neconomy.    The cross-border trading of financial asse ts has seen an even more rapid increase \nin importance than trading of goods and servic es.  It’s impossible to measure exactly how \nmuch the trading in world financial mark ets has grown, but we can get a good idea by \ncomparing the increase in U.S. foreign assets and liabilities with th e increase in trade and \nGDP.  From 1980 to 2003, U.S. foreign assets ro se by a factor of 13 (from $584 billion to \n$7.680 trillion) and foreign liabilities rose  by a factor of 20.  By comparison, GDP \n(current dollars) rose by a factor of 4 and U.S. trade rose by a factor 5.   \n There is another way we can look at th e increasing importance of cross-border \ntrading of financial claims.  Again, we are somewhat limited by a lack of complete data.  \nNonetheless, the percent of U.S. long-term securities owned by foreigners has increased \nfrom about 5 percent in 1974 to  14 percent last year.   \nWhy have world markets for goods and serv ices and world markets for financial \nassets grown so rapidly?  First, more a nd more countries have recognized the strong \n                                                \n \n2 The top 10 trading partners (in merchandise trade) in 1949 were Canada, United Kingdom, Bermuda and \nCaribbean, Brazil, Germany, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, France, and Columbia.  During 1971-75 the top 10 \nincluded Canada, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Mexico, Italy, France, Venezuela, Netherlands, and Brazil.  The top 10 in 2000-04 were Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Korea, \nTaiwan, France, and Italy. \n\n 5\nrelationship between openness to  the global economy and econo mic growth.  As a result, \nthey have joined the global economy.   \nImmediately following World War II, wo rld trade was limited.  The world’s \neconomy was splintered into political sphe res of influence.  In addition, many \nindustrialized countries put signi ficant restrictions on intern ational flows of capital, and \nmany developing economies believed that the path to sustainable growth was through \nimport subsidies to local industries.  The facts show that the only outcome of such \npolicies is stagnation and poverty. \nViews began to change in the late 1980s with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \nadoption of market-oriented policies in many countries.  The number of countries taking \npart in the global economy soared.  The list of newly emerging countries grew to include \nChina, India, many countries in Asia and East ern Europe, and the form er Soviet Union.  \nIn choosing to join the globa l economy, these countries have  reduced their reliance on \ncapital controls and other barriers to tr ade.  You need only look at recent economic \nreports coming out of these countries to apprecia te the benefits that have accrued to them \nfrom embracing a more open trade policy. \nBut the increasing importance of globa lization cannot be explained simply by \nmore countries engaging in the global economy.  Improvements in the technology of \ntransportation have reduced the costs of  shipping goods and services, making global \ntransactions faster and more affordable.  At  the same time, the IT  revolution has yielded \nsignificant savings in both the time and cost of communications and information \nprocessing.  In this way, the internet and t echnology has created a gl obal marketplace for \n\n 6\nservices.  This is important for the United St ates because services—especially those that \nrequire technology and high-skil led labor—represent our co mparative advantage.   \nAnother factor is a general trend by g overnments to reduce tariffs and other \nbarriers to trade, which has reduced the cost  of international trad e.  In 1947, one of \nthe first postwar trade agreements was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, the predecessor of today's World Trade Organiza tion (WTO).  GATT \nreflected the leadership of the United States  in an expanding system  of world trade.  \nSince then, the average tariff in the United St ates has shrunk from about 20 percent to \njust 5 percent, and tariff reductions world wide rival these U.S. figures. \nBENEFITS AND COSTS OF GLOBALIZATION \n \nDiscussions of globalization frequently turn  into a debate:  Do the benefits exceed \nthe costs?  On one side of the debate are economists, who generally see gl obalization as \npositive.  On the other side are various protectionist groups, which tend to emphasize the \nnegative.   \nThe costs of globalization are typically measured in jobs lost to foreign \ncompetitors.  These costs do make for good headlines.  They are quite visible and frequently concentrated in specific regions .  In contrast, the economic benefits of \nglobalization tend to be harder to measure and spread over the en tire population.  A \nproper accounting, however, suggests that the benefits far exceed the costs so that globalization should be viewed as a positive economic development. \nEconomists from Adam Smith on have emphasized how trade can be mutually \nbeneficial to the countries i nvolved.  A number of efficien cies emerge when countries \nspecialize in producing those goods in which they have a comparative advantage.  \n\n 7\nCompetition translates these efficiencies into  lower prices for consumers.  In addition, \ntrade may benefit consumers by providing a gr eater variety of products than would be \navailable through domes tic production alone. \nIncreased financial linkages across countries  can also be beneficial by channeling \nsavings to those areas of the world where in vestment opportunities are best.  This is \nparticularly true for developi ng countries where the return to capital is potentially quite \nhigh, making them an attractive place for fore ign investors.  One generally expects high \nrates of return in developing countries because they generally have a younger and more rapidly growing workforce with rela tively little capital per worker.\n3    \nBut, countries like the United States can also benefit if investment opportunities \ndriven by strong productivity growth attract fo reign saving as we saw in the late 1990s. \nBeginning in about 1995, the increase in produc tivity growth led to an increase in real \nrates of return in the United States and st ronger investment spending.  Such investment \nspending can be financed from either U.S. sa ving or foreign saving.  Fortunately, foreign \ninvestors were willing to invest  their saving in U.S. assets, thereby helping to finance our \ninvestment projects.  This wa s particularly important because  our national saving rate is \nlow, due in part to personal  saving falling from 3.4 percent to  1.7 percent of GNP.  As it \nturns out, between 1995 and 2000, net foreign saving rose from 1.5 percent of GNP to 4.2 percent.  Without the benefit of foreign investors choosing to  invest in the United States, \nit is likely that U.S. investment spending would have been lower. \n                                                \n \n3 In general, this means that developing countries would be expected to be net borrowers from the \nindustrialized economies of the world.  This was generally true.  However, following a series of financial crises—beginning with Mexico in 1994—many develo ping countries actually became net lenders rather \nthan net borrowers on global financial markets.   \n\n 8\nWhile the benefits of globa lization are difficult to meas ure accurately, we do have \nmuch evidence suggesting that they are sign ificant.  One recent economic study finds a \nlarge positive effect of openness to trade on a country’s real GDP per capita.4  A one \npercentage point increase in the ratio of trade to GDP increases income per person by \nbetween 1.5 to 2 percent.  A nother study suggests that the be nefits from international \ntrade were about $2,500 per household in 2002.5   \nFinally, a recent study from the Federal Re serve Bank of New York suggests that \ntraditional measures of the benefits from trade may be understated by failing to include \nthe benefits to consumers of greater product variety.6  After correcting measures of \nimport prices for the impact of greater produc t variety, the authors conclude that from \n1972 to 2001, greater product variety raised U.S.  welfare by $260 billi on or 3 percent of \n(2001) GDP. \nExpanding global trade has clearly benefite d Colorado.  A study prepared for the \nDenver Mayor’s Office found that exports by local firms directly account for about \n46,000 jobs in the Denver metro economy.  If you  add in indirect and induced effects, \nsuch as local firms supplying parts and serv ices to exporters, gl obal linkages account for \nabout 123,000 jobs and $5 billion in income. \nColorado firms are also reaping benefits.  One engineering firm is an \nenvironmental advisor for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.  Another firm has won contracts \n                                                 \n4 \"Does Trade Cause Growth?\" Jeffrey Frankel and David Romer, American Economic Review , June \n1999.  \n5 “The Benefits of Free Trade to U.S. Consumers,” James Langenfeld and James Nieberding, Business \nEconomics, July 2005, pages 41 – 51.  \n6  “Are We Underestimating the Gains from Globalization for the United States,” Christian Broda and \nDavid Weinstein, Current Issues in Economics and Finance , Federal Reserve Bank of New York, April \n2005. \n \n\n 9\nto build water and wastewater plants in Ch ina and is working on the Three Gorges Dam \non the Yangtze River.  And high-tech firms in Colorado are serving large corporate \nclients across the globe.  One data storage fi rm recently facilitated the merger of two of \nthe largest banks in South Korea. \nOf course, these benefits don’t come w ithout costs.  The principal costs of \nincreased globalization are the job losses and plant shutdowns that result from changing \ntrade patterns.  While these losses have trad itionally been associat ed with manufacturing, \nover the past two years, more attention ha s been focused on the outsourcing of service \njobs.  Without attempting to minimize th e difficulties faced by individuals and \ncommunities affected by outsourcing, I would note that most economic studies find that \noutsourcing has been small re lative to the overall size of  the U.S. labor market.7  \nMoreover, since increased trade results in more  exports as well as more imports, jobs lost \nthrough outsourcing need to be balanced agains t jobs gained through increased exports to \nget an accurate measure of how glob alization affects overall employment.8 \nAnother potential cost of globalization co mes via the increase d financial linkages \namong countries.  Investor funds that flow  into a country in search of attractive \ninvestment returns can flow out  very rapidly at the first signs of an economic downturn, \nexacerbating the magnitude of the downturn.  Moreover, as we saw on a number of occasions over the past decade, volatile financ ial flows can cause financial difficulties in \none country to spill over into financial markets in other coun tries.  Developing countries \n                                                \n \n7 “Offshoring in the Service Sector:  Economic Imp act and Policy Issues,” C. Alan Garner, Economic \nReview , Federal Reserve Bank of Kans as City, third quarter, 2004. \n8 “U.S. Jobs Gained and Lost Through Trade: A Net Measure,” Erica Groschen, Ba rt Hobijn, Margaret M. \nMcConnell, Current Issues in Economics and Finance , Federal Reserve Bank of New York, August 2005. \n\n 10\nwith underdeveloped domestic financial markets are likely to be espe cially vulnerable to \nthese events, but larger industrialize d countries could al so be affected. \nIn evaluating the economic benefits and co sts of globalization, it is important to \nremember that the benefits continue to accrue  over time, while the costs tend to be of \nmore limited duration in an economy as dynamic as that of the U.S.  Thus, on a long-term basis, the benefits will certainly outweigh the costs.  In this light , it is important for \npolicymakers to take actions to promote and enhance the positive e ffects of globalization \nwhile working to manage and minimize the associated costs. \nPOLICY IMPLICATIONS \n \nIn my view, globalization is both inevitabl e and beneficial.  C onsequently, we are \nlikely to be better off by adapting to the cha nges it brings rather than by attempting to \nresist its progress. \nFrom this perspective, the key questi on is how to manage the globalization \nprocess to maximize its benefits and minimize its  costs.  Certainly, we need to continue \nto support the lowering of trade barriers both on a multilateral basis through the WTO \nand on a bilateral basis with important trading partners.  Conversely, while we must insist \non achieving fair agreements with our trading partners, we need to resist pressures to \nadopt protectionist measures for those indus tries that are most exposed to increased \nglobal competition. \nThe emergence of new players in the world economy has increased the \ncompetitive pressures facing U.S. firms—both exporters and those that compete with \nimports.  To address this issue, we must insure that we remain competitive in those sectors in which we have a comparative adva ntage.  I would suggest that those sectors \n\n 11\ninvolve capital-intensive technologies and skil led labor.  In this re gard, a strong general \nand advanced education system is important.  In addition, incentives for R&D (but not \nindustrial policy) may also play an impor tant role in enhancing our comparative \nadvantage.    \nAt the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that some workers will lose their jobs \nas the result of intense foreign competition.  I believe the proper policy response is to \nease the transition costs through retraining, upgrading, and acquisition of new skills.   \nOne way to ease the transition costs is to provide assistance to workers that have \nlost their jobs.  The Trade Adjustment Assi stance program is one program that provides \ntraining and income support to workers that ha ve been hurt by inte rnational trade.   \nOur system of community colleges, by gi ving students important new job skills, \nalso can play an important role.   For exampl e, over half of the he althcare, life science, \nphysical science, and social sc ience technicians in the United States have an associate’s \ndegree. \nWe also can take steps to ensure that increased financial market integration does \nnot lead to financial instability.  In this regard, it is particularly important to help \ndeveloping and emerging market economies cr eate strong and resilient banking systems \nso that they do not become a source of syst emic instability.  We can encourage this by \nassisting these countries in de veloping appropriate systems for financial supervision and \nregulation and best accounting practices.  At the same time, we need to ensure that \nappropriate facilities are available at the intern ational level to assist in the event that a \ncrisis occurs and help minimize damage to the international financial system. \n \n\n 12\nCONCLUSIONS  \nI would like to conclude with a brief summary and then respond to your \nquestions.  Globalization will probably always have its skeptics and detractors.  But, Marco Polo had detractors too.  For centur ies, in fact, many people doubted that he \nactually went to China.  But, he did, a nd Europe and Asia benefited greatly.   \nIn considering the economic benefits a nd costs, I would conclude that the \nbenefits—which are long lasting—outweigh the costs.  In arriving at  this conclusion, I do \nnot mean to minimize the hardship caused by workers losing their jobs or firms shutting \ndown their factories.  But, it is important to  remember that these costs can be managed \nand made transitory as workers and firms adjust  to the new economic realities.  There is a \nrole for government policy in minimizing these transition costs.  And there is an even larger role for a strong educational system which will allow us to maintain our competitive edge in products that requir e technology and high-skilled labor."

Introduction \nCommunity banks play a particul arly important role within in the Kansas City Federal \nReserve District, and the performance and heal th of community banks is a key focal point \nof our supervisory efforts.  As all of you are aw are, now is a particularly apt time to think \nabout what the future might hold for commun ity banks and what we as community bank \nsupervisors should be doing.   \nMany revolutionary changes have occurred in our financial system over the past \nseveral decades, including the disappearance of about half the community banks in the \nUnited States.  At the same, significant numbe rs of new banks are being chartered by \ninvestors seeking to fulfill perceived needs in their communities.  For some, this recent past implies a limited and declining role for community banks, while others believe there \nis still a wealth of opportunities available for smaller institutions. \nMy remarks will first address the question of why community banks are important.  \nNext, I will discuss the serious challenges th at community banks will face, and then we \nwill explore what these challenges mean fo r community bankers and what the future \nholds for us as community bank supervisors.   \n \nII. Why are community banks important? \nWith banking consolidation and the growth of very large organi zations, the Federal \nReserve and other regulators recently have accorded much attention to systemically important institutions and the large comp lex banking organizations (LCBO) population.  \nSometimes lost in this large bank focus is the very important role played by community \nbanks. \n\n 3The critical role that smaller banks play  in their communities was something that \nbecame very apparent to me as a bank supervisor  in the 1980s.  In our District, this period \nprovided firsthand experience with what happe ns in communities when banks encounter \nproblems and no longer have the financial resour ces to adequately serve their customers.  \nWhile none of us want to repeat that experi ence, it provided detail ed insights regarding \nthe many different and crucial roles bankers  play in their communities and what can \nhappen when these links are disrupted. \nIn today’s environment, we can cite a va riety of financial needs that community \nbanks serve, including lending to such groups as small businesses, home buyers and real \nestate developers, consumers, and farmers.  In addition, community bankers meet their \ncustomers’ needs for transaction and savings services and provide much in the way of \nleadership and financial advice in their communities. \nLarger banks and other financial institu tions provide many similar, competing \nservices.  However, community banks have traditionally found a unique and essential role \nin picking up business that doesn’t quite f it the parameters under which other institutions \noperate.  This business, for instance, ofte n includes small companies and individuals \nwithout extensive track records and detailed  financial statements, customers seeking \nmore personalized services and treatment, and communities or markets with smaller volumes of financial activity. \nI think the type of small business lending co mmunity banks do is a perfect example of \nthe flexible and innovative nature of these in stitutions.  Such lending also fulfills a need \nthat might not otherwise be met so effectively in our financial markets.   In fact, the role \nand importance of community banks is linke d hand in hand with that of many small \nbusinesses.  \n\n 4In a study our Bank completed two years ago, we found that community banks – \nthose with less than $1 billion in assets – accounted for one-third of the small business \nlending done by banks.  This lending role is much larger than the share of all bank \ndeposits held by community banks – 19 per cent – or bank assets  – 15 percent.  \nCommunity banks even provide additiona l support to small businesses through \nnonresidential real esta te lending and individual lending to  the owners of small business. \nSmall business lending by community banks also is important because of the unique \nform it often takes.  In cont rast to the “credit scored” and credit card loans that large \nbanks typically offer to small businesses, community banks have made a market for themselves in relationship lending.  Such  lending involves taking time to thoroughly \ninvestigate and understand a small business, esp ecially in cases where there may be little \ncredit history or collateral to support a loan.  Good relationship lending also entails \nclosely monitoring a borrower after a loan is  made and then being in a position to \ncontinue meeting the needs of a small busine ss as its operations prove successful.  The \nstrength of community banks in relationship lending makes them particularly adept at \nmeeting the needs of start-up businesses a nd businesses serving unique and innovative \nmarkets. \nHow important is this small business lendi ng role to the overall economy?  A few \nstatistics on small businesses provide a good indi cation of their importance.  According to \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration, sma ll businesses – those with fewer than 500 \nemployees – represent 99.7 per cent of all employers and em ploy one-half of all private \nsector employees – including much of the high-tech workforce.  In addition, small \nbusinesses generated 60 to 80 percent of net new jobs a nnually during the 1990s, created \n\n 5more than 50 percent of nonfarm priv ate GDP, and produced many of the most \ncommonly cited patents in the United States. \nThe role of small businesses was perhaps ev en more critical in  the recent recession.  \nWhile large businesses expe rienced a net decrease in employment in 2000 and 2001, \nsmall businesses hired more than 1.1 million ne w employees, thus creating all of the net \ngain in jobs for the U.S. economy. \nIn many ways, the importance of community ba nks parallels that of small businesses.  \nWhile a community bank might not appear to be too important in the overall context of \nU.S. banking, community banks are important individually to their communities and, in \nthe aggregate, to the national economy.  Equally significant, th ey have served as a testing \npoint or incubator for many start-up businesse s and concepts that later assume a much \nlarger role in the economy. \n \nIII. What are the challenges community banks face? \nA key set of questions for community bankers is: What challenges will they have to \naddress, and what will the future hold for them?  In other words, is the playing field changing for community bankers?  I think th at these are interesting and important \nquestions for us to explore today – in part be cause we all play a role in the future of \ncommunity banks, but also because the outcome is by no means clear. \nCommunity bankers typically express a pos itive, optimistic outlook while mentioning \na host of things that must be done to improve  their situation.  According to a survey we \nconducted last year of the comm unity bankers in our District, we found that virtually all \nof the respondents had a positive outlook – 94 percent of those responding to our survey, for example, believed that it was “likely” or  “very likely” that they would operate under \n\n 6the same ownership and operating structure for the next five years.  In addition, more \nthan half of the bankers anticipated opening or acquiring additional branch offices during this period, thus indicating that many plan to expand their operations soon. \nUndoubtedly, a key factor in th e optimism of community banke rs is the record levels \nof profitability they are achieving – a perf ormance that comes just after banks went \nthrough some of the most challenging times  in the industry.  For instance, today’s \ncommunity bankers have successfully dealt with  such challenges as the banking crisis of \nthe 1980s and early 1990s, when more than 1,600  banks failed. They also have survived \ninterest rate deregulation, th e relaxation of geographic cons traints on bank expansion, and \nrapid technological innovation in banking, including Internet banking.  At the time, most \nthought that each of these events would grea tly favor large banks and place community \nbanks at a severe disadvantage. \nAlthough community banks may play a somewh at smaller role than they once did, \ntheir record demonstrates that they have been remarkably innovativ e and flexible during \nperiods of considerable stress.  This record al so shows that they fill an important need in \nour financial system.    \nHowever, it would be a mistake for commun ity bankers to become complacent and \nthink that they will not face strong challenges going forward.  In many ways, I think community bankers may face comparable, if not stronger, challenges than in the recent \npast.  Consequently, while it is difficult to see how everything will play out for community banks, I would like to spend some  time looking at the possible challenges for \ncommunity banks.   \nOne indication of the challenges community  banks will face comes from our survey \nof community bankers in the Te nth District.  When we aske d them about the challenges \n\n 7they expect over the next five years, th e most common responses were developing new \nsources of noninterest income, maintaining and attracting retail de posits, and achieving \nsatisfactory loan growth.  Other popular respons es were achieving satisf actory net interest \nmargin and return on average assets, meeting competition from other community banks, dealing with technological change, and meeting regulator y compliance requirements.  \nBanks in slow-growing markets also mentioned the challenge of dea ling with this slow \ngrowth and finding opportunities for diversification.     \nThese responses all seem to reflect con cerns about the competitive environment \ncommunity banks will face and whether they can generate the business and revenue streams to be competitive players.  As a result, we should take a step back and have a broader look at the competitive framework in our financial mark ets and the underlying \nfactors that will test community banks. \nFirst, we all think that we have seen a lot of consolidation in banking, and a recent \nFDIC study predicts that the pace of consolidation is likel y to slow down now that the \nindustry has largely adjusted to the relaxati on of bank expansion laws.  While this might \nbe of some comfort to community bankers, ther e also are strong reasons  for believing that \nconsolidation will continue – includi ng much at the community bank level. \nIn fact, if we look at other industries, they  seem to be experiencing continued pressure \nfor consolidation and in the c ontext of an evermore competitive environment.  This is \nparticularly true for teleco mmunications, transportation, reta il trade, and a number of \nother service sectors.  Wal-Mart, for exam ple, still continues a strategy of rapid \nexpansion.  While Wal-Mart first focused on rural markets where it faced weaker \ncompetition, it has continued to work on improving its distribution system and is now assuming an important and growing role in ma ny metropolitan markets.  Similar patterns \n\n 8can be seen in other retailers,  grocery stores, and re staurants, and franchising is leading to \nother forms of consolidation. \nA number of lessons for banki ng can be drawn from these tr ends in other industries.  \nOne key lesson is that those best able to ma ster their product distribution channels will \nfind further opportunities for expansion.  In this regard, larger banking organizations \nappear to have become better in handling their acquisitions, and there are signs that \ncommunity banks are no longer benefiting much from customer fallout after big mergers.  \nAlso, many larger banks are now paying more atte ntion to their retail business in an effort \nto lower their funding costs and make up for r ecent declines in larg e corporate lending.  \nIn fact, many large banks are expanding their branching networks in metropolitan \nmarkets, thereby bringing community banks and their larger counterpart s into more direct \ncompetition.  An additional lesson is that co nsolidation in other industries will continue \nto reduce the traditional cu stomer base of community banks as more “ma and pa” \nbusinesses are replaced by “big box” retailers and franchises. \nAnother factor in the competitive framework th at is likely to become more of a test \nfor community banks is fundi ng costs.  Banks, particularly community banks, have \nbenefited over the past few years from incr eased liquidity and low rates on deposits.  \nDeclining returns in the stock market and in other markets also have made deposits more \nattractive.  Rising interest rates, better st ock returns, and the increased attention large \nbanks are giving to retail banking all sugge st that community bank funding will again \nbecome more challenging.  In  addition, credit unions contin ue to expand rapidly and are \nattracting funds from many customers that would otherwise turn to community banks. \nA third factor to consider as we look fo rward is technology.  Co mmunity banks have \nbeen remarkably successful in finding third- party vendors to meet their growing needs in \n\n 9technology.  These vendors have allowed community banks to match many of the \nservices offered by larger banks and in a reasonably efficient manner.  However, \ntechnological innovation raises a number of competitive issues for community banks.  \nSome of the more important include:  Can co mmunity banks continue to be efficient and \ninnovative as they rely on others to provi de their technology?  Will scale economies and \nthe cost of technology give large banks a clear advantage at some point in the future, and \nwill community banks have greater problems gaining access to payments and clearing networks?  Will declining information costs allow big banks to reach more of the traditional customer base of community banks? \nOne other consideration is that many ru ral community banks are located in small \ncommunities with limited growth prospects a nd declining populations.  Such markets \npose another set of challenges for these banks.  An important question for such banks is: \nCan they continue to generate enough busin ess from their own community to operate \nefficiently or should they look for expansi on and consolidation oppor tunities in other \nmarkets? \nA final factor is regulation.  The fixed co st of regulation has a particularly high \nimpact on community banks since they have to become familiar with and comply with \nmany of the same regulations as large banks, while having much less of a customer base \nover which to spread these compliance costs.  An even better explanation of this was \nprovided by a banker in our Dist rict who stated, “The regulat ion of small banks is like \nkilling a gnat with a sledgehammer.” \nAll of these challenges thus suggest th at the playing field and the competitive \nenvironment facing community banks will continue to increase in its intensity. \n        \n\n 10IV. What will these challenges mean for community bankers? \nAs we turn to the question of what comm unity bankers will have to do to address \nthese challenges, I think we all realize that it is hard, if not impossible, to anticipate how \nthings will play out for community banks.  As Yogi Berra once said, “the future ain’t \nwhat it used to be.” \nWe just discussed a number of reasons why the traditional customer base for \ncommunity banks could be declining, wh ile the competitive framework they face \nbecomes more intense.  However, we also have learned not to sell community bankers \nshort when it comes to developing innovativ e and successful banking strategies.    \nGiven the difficulties in forecasting trends, I would like to turn instead to what we \nlearned from a study of successful community banks in the Tenth District.  While many \nof the specific strategies these banks have us ed may have to be adapted to fit tomorrow’s \nconditions, I think their basic approach to banking provides a clear picture of what \ncommunity banks must do to be su ccessful in any environment.  \nWe recently analyzed the performance of Te nth District community banks in slower-\ngrowing markets.  We found that the typica l community bank in th ese slow-growth areas \ndid not perform as well as community banks in faster-growing markets when we looked \nat earnings, funding costs, efficiency, nonint erest income, and asset quality.  However, \nwe did find a number of banks that did remarkably well in these more challenging markets, achieving a performance level near the top of all banks in the District.  To find \nout how these banks could be so succe ssful under less favorab le conditions, we \ninterviewed the presidents  at 10 of these banks. \nAlthough the general recipe for success at th ese banks shouldn’t surprise any of you \nas community bank examiners, the real ke ys to their performance were the strong \n\n 11commitment to making their plans and strategi es work, along with the ideas they had for \nserving their communities. \nThese bankers began with a positive but rea listic attitude toward what they could \naccomplish.  They concentrated on getting the basic business of banking down right, \nincluding exceptional customer  service, highly efficient operations, and unquestionable \ncredit quality.  Several comments from thes e high-performing banke rs illustrate this \nattitude:  “We provide customers with everyt hing a big bank can do, but at a better rate, \nquicker service, and more personal service.  Customers can call me at home on Saturday \nand Sunday.”  Another banker said, “We go the ex tra mile to take care of our customers. \nWe do what other banks say they will.”  Here  is a quote that should please examiners:  \n“We feel credit quality is the number 1 issue we  have to deal with. We feel strongly we \ndon’t want to have any questionable loans – in generating earnings make  sure it is real.” \nPerhaps the best story from one of these banke rs was:  “We were a very small, 1-rated \nbank back in the 1980s. All these other banks began having problems and we just started \nacquiring them. That set us on our way and we  just stayed with that sound credit \nphilosophy.”  In case you ar e wondering about this bank – in 1980, it operated from a \nsingle office in a town of about 300 people a nd had about $10 million in assets.  Now, it \nhas about $135 million in assets  and has offices in 10 differe nt rural communities (five of \nwhich have populations less than 250 each).  Moreover, this bank still provides strong \nsupport to its communities, wh ile encountering virtually no credit quality problems. \nAnother important key to success for these ba nkers is that they are very active and \ninnovative in looking for new business lines, but  they enter new activ ities carefully and \nslowly and then expand as their customers pr ove themselves and begi n to grow their own \nbusinesses.  In the words of one banker, “We started out very slowly and carefully into \n\n 12other types of lending. We are a conservatively aggressive group. We want to do things, \nbut we want to do it slowly enough so  we don’t risk what we have.” \nNearly all of the bankers mentioned a ha rd-working staff and dedicated board of \ndirectors as critical elements  in their bank’s success.  On e banker told us, “Part of our \nsuccess I might say is willingness to work.  I credit the staff with a lot of it, because \neveryone down to the last pers on is willing to take care of the people they deal with, and \nthey are willing to work the hours it takes to make it work.” \nThese bankers almost uniformly agreed th at keeping up with banking regulation was \na major challenge for their banks.  These bankers, consequently, used a variety of methods for achieving regulatory compliance,  including spreading the responsibility \naround amongst several staff people, subscrib ing to regulatory so ftware, designating a \ncompliance person, outsourcing part of their loan compliance, and attending regulatory \nupdate seminars given by supervisor s and state banking associations.  \nThe bankers also attributed much of thei r success to assisting the local community \nand the bank’s next generation of customers.  In a number of cases, this meant using FSA \nguarantees and SBA loans to meet the needs of young farmers and small businesses.  As \none banker stated, “We do many FSA guaranteed  loans and a lot of these are for first-\ntime borrowers – new, younger farmers.  If a guy makes it, he will be with you forever.”  \nAlso, several of these bankers were trying to find ways to use Internet banking and other \nmeans to maintain the banki ng business of younger people, including those that were \nmoving away. \nIn short, these bankers dealt with some ve ry challenging conditions by demonstrating \na thoroughly professional attitude, coupled w ith a strong commitment to their customers \n\n 13and communities.  So, if I have one predicti on for the future of community banks, it’s \nthat bankers who follow these same guidelines ar e the most likely to be successful.     \n \nV.  What does the future hold for us as community bank supervisors?  \n As examiners and supervisors, we have an important role to play in the future of \ncommunity banks.  First, as the playing fiel d changes, we, as re gulators, must make \ncertain that the new playing field ensures a s ound and stable financial system.  We have a \nduty to be sure that a community bank -- no le ss than an LCBO – is operated safely and \nsoundly.  Weak and failing banks, while so metimes unavoidable in a market economy, \nare highly disruptive to their customers a nd communities.  Consequently, as examiners \nand supervisors, your first and foremost duty is  to apply the same prudential concerns and \nstandards to community banks that would be applied to LCBOs and other banks.  \nIn this prudential role, I would like to  emphasize that you, as examiners, are \nextremely important to the future of comm unity banks.  Each of you has taken an in-\ndepth look at dozens of different community ba nks and is in a good position to assess the \ncomparative strengths and weaknesses of thes e banks.  Thus, you are in a position to let \nbankers know where they are successfully following best practices, where they have \nshortcomings that they should correct, and what they can do to manage the risks they \nface. \nThis traditional examiner’s role is partic ularly important at community banks, since \nmany smaller banks have no one else maki ng an independent assessment of their \noperations and overall condition.  Consequently , I would encourage each of you to make \nfull use of your experience and insights as you play an active and helpful role in the \ncommunity banks you examine. \n\n 14A second role that we play as examiners and part of the Federal Re serve is in creating \na supervisory and regulatory framework that is effective in meeting our goals, is equitable \nfor all financial institutions, and keeps comp liance costs to a minimum.  Maintaining a \nsupervisory framework that meets all of these objectives, though, is becoming more \ncomplicated.  Large banks continue to expand and take on broader and more complex activities, while most community banks rema in focused on traditi onal banking services.  \nAs a result, there are growing differences across the banking industry and an increasing \nconcern over what is appropr iate in regulating both small and large banks.  The \nregulatory review mandated  by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1996 (EGRPRA) is focusi ng further attention on these regulatory \nissues. \nThis issue of an appropriate supervisory fr amework is a vital topi c in the future of \ncommunity banks and one that will be receivin g much emphasis over the next few years.  \nI believe that examiners can be an important part of this process.  Indeed, many of our \nbest regulatory comments and suggestions ha ve come from field examiners, such as \nyourselves, who see the effect of particular regulations on daily basis, as well as the \ncompliance issues they raise.  Consequentl y, I would encourage each  of you to continue \nto look for ways to improve our regulatory  framework and to voi ce your opinions to your \nBank’s management and throughout the Federal Reserve System. \nIn looking forward, there are a number of co mmunity bank regulatory issues that the \nFederal Reserve and other banking agencies will have to resolve.  I would like to take a \nfew minutes to present some of these. \nOne current topic is CRA, especially with  the actions being taken by the Federal \nReserve, OTS, OCC, and FDIC to raise th e small institution threshold.  However, a \n\n 15broader issue we must address is to determin e the best way to eval uate the contributions \nsmaller banks make to their communities.  Does lending in the community provide most \nof this picture?  Or is there something more  that should be expect ed of community banks, \nand what size of bank should trigger different expectations and concerns? \nAnother community bank regulatory issue is capital standards.  Basel II will allow \nlarge banks to link their regulator y capital closer to their own measures of risk.  In some \nareas, such as residential mortgage lending and perhaps small business lending, Basel II \nmight encourage major banks to make more loan s or to hold more on their balance sheets.  \nAlthough most community banks typically hold capital in ex cess of regulatory \nrequirements, any advantages that Basel II might give to major banks could worsen the \ncompetitive position of smaller banks.  Also, in vestors and large depositors could take the \nview that Basel II banks are developing more  effective and transparent risk management \nsystems. \nThe banking agencies are now discussing how  the original Capital Accord could be \nchanged to better measure risk exposures at  banks not adopting the Basel II framework.  \nFeedback from examiners would be particularly  helpful in constructing new risk weights \nappropriate for community banks .  Also, supervisors have been working on a new loan \nclassification framework that will go  beyond the current emphasis on borrower \nweaknesses and will attempt to focus more on the expected losses from a loan.  This \nchange will bring community bank loan a ssessments more in line with how Basel II \nbanks will be assessing their loans.  Community  bankers also are likely to require added \nhelp from examiners as a new classifica tion framework is implemented.      \nIn all the surveys I have seen, community  bankers invariably list the USA PATRIOT \nAct and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) as the tw o most burdensome laws they face – even \n\n 16more so than Regulation Z and CRA.  I know  many of you have heard complaints from \ncommunity bankers about BSA and the USA PATR IOT Act, and a variety of things have \nbeen discussed, ranging from changing the enforcement procedures for small banks to regulatory relief in other areas  to compensate for the tim e bankers spend on these two \nacts. \nAnother important regulatory  question we should be aski ng ourselves is:  To the \nextent that community banks ha ve a need to consolidate with  one another, do our policies \nneedlessly hinder such actions?  More speci fically, should we further relax antitrust \npolicies to facilitate more community ba nk mergers in declining or slow-growing \nmarkets?  Also, where should the Federal Reserve set the size limit for the small bank holding company debt policy? \nOne other area where we must be careful to  implement policies that reflect the unique \nnature of community banks is corporate governance.  Family ownership at many \ncommunity banks coupled with much of the fa mily’s wealth tied up in the bank suggests \na strong inherent interest in controlling risk and addressi ng stockholder concerns.  As a \nresult, some corporate governance problems a nd recommendations are less likely to apply \nto closely held community banks.  Other problems we may face include the cost of \nimposing Sarbanes-Oxley on the larger community  banks that are publicly traded.  In this \nregard, the SEC has shown some interest in  reviewing what should be expected of \nsmaller, publicly traded companies. \nA final regulatory issue for the Federal Reserv e to consider is how to make financial \ndisclosures easier for consumer s to understand and less of a burden on banks.  This is \nobviously a concern for all banks and their customers, but it is of particular interest at \ncommunity banks. \n\n 17These are all topics for which you have a great deal of expertise and I hope you will \nmake your views known throughout the Federal Reserve. \n            \nVI. Concluding comments \nIn summary, I would like to  raise the question again of  what is the outlook for \ncommunity banks.  I believe that community banks  have an important role to play in our \neconomy – a role that other financial market participants would have trouble filling as \nwell as community banks have. \nThis need for community banks, though, is no guarantee of success.  Community \nbanks will face a number of significant challenges in the future and will face greater competition for their customer base, which ar e trends that could lead to a gradually \ndeclining role for these banks.  Such tr ends also may mean more mergers among \ncommunity banks as the more successful co mmunity bankers are called upon to spread \ntheir strategies to more markets and reach more efficient scales of operation. \nI also would note that it would be wrong to sell comm unity banks short.  As \npreviously mentioned, we have seen community  banks in the Tenth District performing at \nexceptional levels – even under very challengi ng circumstances.  I’m sure many of you \nhave seen such banks in your own Districts.  These banks – by gett ing the basic business \nof banking down right and by meeting the need s of their communities in an innovative \nand prudential manner – provide an indicati on of what community banks must do to \nsurvive and prosper. \nFinally, I cannot stress enough the role that you, as examiners, and we, as the Federal \nReserve, have to play in the future of comm unity banks.  You are in the best position of \nanyone to judge how well the regulation of  community banks is working – which \n\n 18regulations are effective, which impose too much of a burden, and what should be done \nin reforming community bank regulation.  In addition, community bankers value your advice, especially given your experience and training and the wealth of information you \nhave acquired on community banks.  I can a ssure you that the Federal Reserve System \nalso values all the contributions you are making to community bank supervision."

Hoenig  \nPresident  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMeeting for Heads of Supervision  \nBank for International Settlements  \nBasel, Switzerland  \nApril 27, 2004  \n \n\n2 \nI. Introduction  \n \nI am pleased to be here today to talk about a subject that is of great interest to me, as I am \ninvolved in both financial supervision and monetary policy .  This subject –how our supervisory \nframework can contribute to a stable financial sy stem that fully supports sustainable economic \ngrowth –is important for several reasons.   \nIn recent years, in developing as well as developed countries, financial crises have \noccurred all too often, and have imposed great costs to the countries they have af fected.  In fact, \nin recent decades very few countries have escaped some form of financial distress or crisis.  A \n1996 survey by the IMF, for instance, found that 73 percent of their member count ries had \nexperienced significant banking problems during the preceding 15 years .  Many of these \nproblems led to substantial declines in GDP, serious disruptions in credit and capital markets, \nand adversity  for the banking industry  and its customer base .  This historical record provides a \nclear picture of the importa nce of the supervisory issues we are discussing today –and of the need \nfor careful thought regarding any effort to assure financial stability . \nThese r ecent financial crises have also coincide d with and been influenced by a period of \nrapid and pathbreaking c hanges in our financial markets .  While banks are still a critical part of \nthe financial picture, they are now just one highlight on the financial landscape.  Sharing the \nspotlight are an ever -expanding set of capital markets and the financial instruments and firms \nassociated with them.  In the U nited States at least, these developments are reintegrating banking \nand capital markets to a degree we have  not seen since the Great Depression.  These changes in \nour financial structure are , in turn , altering the n ature of the financial crises we experience.  \nIncreasingly , crises originate in capital markets and are characterized by asset -price volatility and \ndisruptions in market liquidity.   \n\n3 \nBecause  these developments and their effects on the supervisory framework  are far from \nover, I would like to begin with a  review  of the major changes evident in the financial sector .  \nThen I will review some of the supervisory steps already taken to address recent crises within  the \nchanging financial system.   And f inally, I wil l look at what the appropriate role might be for \nmacro -prudential supervision and what could reasonably be accomplished under this framework, \nincluding shifting more attention to capital markets and the need to prevent costly financial crises \nthere.   \nI sho uld mention  again , though, that as I am involved both with financial  supervis ion and \nmonetary policy, I have a natural tendency to think of supervisory issues  in terms of our ultimate \npolicy objectives  of financial stability, sustainable economic growth, a nd customer protection , \nrather than  in terms  of micro - versus macro -prudential supervision.   Thinking of it th is way, I \nwill explain why,  despite all the changes we have observed in financial markets, the problems \npolicymakers face today are the same ones we have always faced.  They are perhaps more \nchallenging today, however, because our financial system  is so much more complex  than it used \nto be .   \n \nII. The Changing Financial System  \n \nAny assessment of t oday ’s financial system –both domes tically and worldwi de–must \nrecognize tha t, in its detail, the system is much different than it was a few  decades ago .  \nTechnology lies a t the heart of much of this change .  Technolog y has greatly reduc ed the cost of \ngathering, processing, and transmi tting information , and thus has allow ed a wide range of new \nfinancial instruments, rapidly growing competition across industry segments, and new methods  \n\n4 \nof conducting financial business and managing risk.   In some ways, this change is revolution ary, \na development of the informatio n age.  In other respects, however, it is just another stage in a n \nevolution that has long been under way , driven in earlier periods by such development s as the \ntelegraph , the telephone , and improved methods of transportation .  From this longer -term \nperspe ctive, what is most novel about this stage of technological change is not that changes are \ntaking place, but that they are occurring at an ever -increasing pace.   \nFrom any perspective, the declin e in transaction and information costs  made possible by \ntechn ology is allowing capital markets to operate more efficiently and to assum e a much broader \nrole in the economy .  One notable  outgrowth of this development is  the disappearance of \npreviously segmented  financial system s.  Today we see  the emergence of a fram ework in which \na wide variety of institutions and markets now compete directly for the same business .  With  this \ncross -industry competition and the rising importance of capital markets , we can no longer view \nprudential  supervision  and systemic risk as bank ing industry issues alone.  \nAnother significant change is the variety  of financial products and services available.  \nInnovative  financial instruments , electronic banking services, securitization,  and the rapid \ngrowth of the derivatives market are now  giving financial customers broader choices and \nallow ing risks to be partitioned and distributed to those most willing to assume them .  As a \nresult, financial institutions and investors now have a multitude of options for controlling and \ndiversifying their risk e xposure .  \nEmerging a long with these developments  have been the institutional consolidation and \nglobalization of financial markets .  This trend is spawning increasing ly large and more complex \norganizations  with activities spread across many countries .  This  development, in turn, is \nincreas ing the interdependencies among major organizations and creating additional systemic \n\n5 \nlinkages . \nIn considering these developments, I w ant to  emphasize two very striking but divergent \npatterns.  First, of course, major financ ial institutions and other market participants have a wide r \nrange of opportunities to diversify risk  through financial engineering and a broader  range of \nactivities.  But at  the same time, the complex web of connections across  institutions,  markets , \nand co untries  is likely  leading to new sources of systemic risk  and financial instability .  We must \nbe prepared to deal with t he effects of these risks .  These patterns are not unique to this recent \nperiod of financial market innovation.  Rather, they have alway s characterized change in \nfinancial markets.  \nClearly , it can be useful to look to the past to inform ourselves regarding  how to better \napproach the future .  But  I would stress that  we need to be careful not to presume too much or to \nrely on past experience  in an indiscriminate way.  It is always tempting to assume that if we can \nlearn how to prevent the crises of the past, we might be able to anticipate future crises.  I will \nargue , instead,  that future crises will always  differ  somewhat from past crises.  This is \nparticularly so because supervision and the role of the market continue to change –in part to \nprevent a replay of the crises of the past.  Consequently, a strict reliance  on past experience s and \nhistorical models is likely to provide limited help in  anticipating the answers we need  in this \nchanging financial landscape .    \n \nIII. A Changing Supervisory System  \n \nThese many and varied developments in the financial system are influencing  how we \nthink about  supervis ing institutions to accomplish our public policy objectives.  Our objectives \n\n6 \nremain the same as always –preventing a  systemic crisis , protecting financial customers , and \npromoting a competitive and efficient financial system  that supports economic growth .  But the \nsteps we use to accomplish these o bjectives are undergoing significant change .  And in pursuing \nthese objectives, we find ourselves, as always, having to consider a n even  broader range of \ninstitutions, activities, and markets . \nTo illustrate how our  supervisory framework  is changing , let me  remind you of one of the \ngreatest  financial  crises in modern  history –the Great Depression of the 1930s .  The public lost \nconfidence in banks  and financial markets , and many banks failed in a period of contagion.  \nQuite naturally, a restrictive regulatory and supervisory system was put in place that focused on \npreventing individual banks from failing , protecting s mall depositors , and increasing  the integrity \nof financial markets .    \nThe financial revolution of the last few decades , however, has  made signifi cant parts of \nthis regulatory framework no longer workable.   Rising competition across different segments of \nthe financial industry –both in the United States and worldwide –has forced us to remove  many \nregulatory  barriers .  Bank interest rate ceilings, limi ts on geographic expansion, and activity \nconstraints, which once served to protect particular segments of the industry, are rapidly \nbecoming things of the past.   Also, recent financial crises have revealed moral -hazard problems \nand loss exposures under public safety nets .  These risks  have forced many countries to take a \ncloser look at the explicit and implicit guarantees they provide and, in some cases, to reduce  or \nrechannel such support.   \nAs an outgrowth of these changes , the marketplace is also playing a greater role in \ndetermining how financial resources will be used  and which institutions and products will \nsurvive and prosper in a more competitive environment .  In turn, t he rising complexity of \n\n7 \nfinancial instruments and institutions is changing the sup ervisory system.  Large institutions are \nnot only conducting a much wider range of activities than before, but they can now more readily \nshift their risk profile s.  These changes, consequently , have  led to greater supervisory focus on an \ninstitution’s risk  management practices and internal controls –that is, to a greater focus on an \ninstitution’s ability to measure, manage, and control its risk exposures .  Associated with this shift \nin focus, banking supervisors have placed less emphasis on a bank’s  balance sheet condition  at a \nsingle point in time.   Also, through “continuous supervision,” as well as “risk matrix” profiles \nand other tools, supervisors are directing closer  attention to the largest organizations, especially \nthose that could pose systemic concer ns.  \nOther significant changes encompass supervisory efforts to control interbank exposures , \nas well as exposures among banks and other financial institutions and markets .  With major \ninstitutions consolidating and becoming even larger, more supervisory at tention is necessarily \nbeing devoted to relationships across institutions and to the systemic risks the se linkages  could \npose.  Some steps supervisors  and institutions have taken include limits on interbank deposits, \nFed daylight overdraft fees and caps, a nd various clearinghouse standards, such as collateral \nrequirements, loss -sharing agreements, and exposure limits.   Marketplace standards and practices \nare further developing to control  counterparty risk in the derivatives market and a cross  many  \ntrading , clearing, and settlement  activities.  \nWithin the capital markets,  a number of regulatory changes have occurred in response to \nmarket disruptions, investor demands, and other events.  T he 1987 stock market crash in the \nUnited States , for example,  brought forth a variety of changes to help ensure that trading would \nhenceforth occur in a controlled and orderly fashion.   Several commercial paper defaults in 1989 \nand 1990  prompted the SEC to  tighte n the  restrictions on the quality , maturity , and \n\n8 \nconcentrations  of commercial paper and securities th at money market mutual funds could hold .  \nIn the wake of Enron , WorldCom, and other recent accounting scandals in the United States, \nseveral steps have been taken  to provide for better corporate governance, more accurate p ublic \ndisclosures, and stronger oversight of public accounting firms.   These include passage of the \nSarbanes -Oxley Act of 2002 and the institution of stricter  stock exchange standards for listed \nfirms.  \nThis is only a brief summary of the changes we are see ing in financial supervision in \nresponse to the revolution in financial services and the recent financial crises that have plagued \nmany countries.  We are , by no means , through with the process of financial reform, which \nbring s us to the issue of how macro -prudential supervision best fits in our supervisory \nframework.  \n   \nIV. The Role for Macro -Prudential Supervision  \n \nIn the context of the aforementioned  framework, I want to focus the rest of my remarks \non the appropriate role for macro -prudential supervisio n in today’s financial environment.  In my \ndual role as a financial supervisor and a monetary policymaker, I am constantly reminded of the \nimportance of having a macro -prudential supervisory focus.  As a supervisor, I have had to deal \nwith the banking and credit problems that arose from the energy , real estate,  and agricultural \ncollapse s in the United States during the 1980s.   And , as a monetary policymaker, I am \nconstantly exposed to many credit and capital market issues regarding the possible buildup of \ndebt and investment imbalances.   Addressing these types of financial stress  is a key challenge for \nmacro -prudential supervision.  \n\n9 \nBased on my experiences, I doubt we will ever predict financial crises very well.  We \nhave never  predict ed them well in the pa st.  If we could have foreseen them  then , we would have \ntaken steps to prevent them , or at least  greatly minimize their consequences.  At our Jackson \nHole Symposium last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that “Uncertainty \nis not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining \ncharacteristic.”  The same comment could be made about financial markets and supervisory \npolicy.   \nThere are many examples of this:  the Asian financial crisis, the Latin American curre ncy \ncrises, the Scandinavian real estate collapse, the U .S. stock market crash of 1987, and the 1998 \nRussian debt crisis and resulting problems with LTCM.  In each case, to varying degrees  we \nwere aware of potential problems and exposures, but problems failed to arise  as expected –until \none day they did  arise .  Often, an economic downturn, high interest rates, or exchange rate \nmovements stressed markets and institutions that once appeared sound to the point of crisis or \nfailure.  Ex post the source of each c risis became  obvious .  Still , we were caught by surprise.  \nConversely, many problems predicted by financial analysts, investors, and supervisors have \nnever materialized.  That is why  we inevitably come back to such basic supervisory and financial \nconcepts as capital adequacy, risk diversification, and limits on interbank and market exposures.   \nWith this said , let me now  address three questions that I believe we should be asking \nourselves when thinking about a macro -prudential supervisory framework.  First, are market \ndiscipline and self -regulation sufficient to prevent systemic crises?  Second, how can supervisory \npolicy better address systemic crises and macroeconomic disturbances?  And third, can monetary \npolicy supplement macro -prudential supervision?   My comments further reflect the importance I \nplace o n having a central bank active in both monetary and supervisory matters.  \n\n10 \n \nAre market discipline and self -regulation sufficient to prevent systemic crises?    \nA factor that is becoming more prominent in a m acro-prudential supervisory framework \nis market discipline  and the role that it could play in making financial market participants more \nresilient to shocks .  With the removal of many regulatory barriers, the market now has greater \ninfluence  in determining the operating parameters for financial institutions and markets.  In fact, \nmany recent financial market developments have occurred precisely out of a desire by market \nparticipants to better share and control risks.  Examples include the growth of the deriv atives \nmarket , increased equity support in U.S. real estate markets , and ongoing investor efforts to \npenalize  financial firms with poor risk management practices and inadequate capital.  \nFor market discipline to work effectively and efficiently, a necessary  ingredient is t imely, \nappropriate, and accurate information.  Both investors and p olicymakers can play an important \nrole in demanding and helping to establish information disclosure standards for financial \ninstitutions and other market participants.  I ha ve also advocated that financial supervisors play \nan active role in helping to ensure financial institutions adequately disclose significant \ninformation to the market, including significant supervisory findings.  \nOur recent past further indicates that the m arketplace  can impose the most effective and \nstrongest form of discipline on financial institutions .  This  discipline  should help reinforce \nmacro -prudential supervision and, when markets are properly structured, contribute to the \nstrength of the overall ec onomy.   However, I believe that financial external ities will prevent \nmarkets from providing all the discipline needed to reduce the risk of contagion to desirable \nlevels.  The complexity of linkages among market participants is making it difficult for the \nmarket to assess true risk exposures , and in spite of recent improvements in public disclosures, \n\n11 \nmarket participants are unlikely to have the full set of data necessary for such assessments .  In \naddition , institutions and investors  generally will have no r eason to internalize the effects that \nthey m ight have on others during a crisis.  \n \nHow can supervisory policy better address systemic crises and macroeconomic disturbances?  \nFrom a supervisory standpoint, many of the steps we have taken during  the last few \ndecades and will be taking in the near term are closely aligned with macro -prudential \nsupervision.  This macro -prudential focus is being driven by the changing financial system.  \nWith larger institutions, greater competition across market seg ments  and the g rowing importance \nof capital markets, supervisors will have to  pay increasing  attention to the interrelationships \namong institutions and markets and to the risk that the largest institutions pose to the overall \nsystem.  In terms of macro -prudential supervi sion, there are three basic concerns for supervisors .  \nThey are to promot e good risk management practices at large institutions that might pose a  \nsystemic risk, to limit exposures between institutions and the markets they serve, and to ensure \nthat supervis ory policies do not have adverse or ill -timed effects over the economic cycle.  \nRisk-focused supervision  is becoming  a cornerstone in supervisory efforts  to address risk \nmanagement practices at large and small institutions.  Under risk -focused supervision, \nsupervisors channel the vast majority of their attention to the areas and activities that create the \ngreatest risk exposure to an individual institution.  For larger institutions, this implies an \nawareness of  risk exposures that pose a potential  threat to other firms  and to the general \neconomy, including any significant risk concentrations in individual markets .  While risk \ndiversification  is nothing new , we should remind ourselves that it is a critical point of emphasis, \nhelping to ensure that institutions  are stable across the economic cycle.   U.S. banks, in fact, have \n\n12 \nperformed remarkably well in a trying environment during  the last few years, and a prime factor \nbehind this performance is improved risk diversification and management.  \nRisk management  is ju st as important for investment banking firms and other market \nparticipants.  While securities firms and some other capital market participants may focus more \non trading activities and less on maintaining a portfolio of assets, it is still essential that t hese \ninstitutions diversify their counterparty risk and thoroughly check the reputation of potential \ntrading parties.  Likewise, merchant banks  and others with a portfolio of  investments are wise to \ndiversify their investment risk.  So , whether you view ris k-focused supervision as micro - or \nmacro -prudential, this form of supervision, along with the related efforts of banks and other \nmarket participants, will help make the financial system less vulnerable to economic \ndisturbances.  \nIn addition to continuing to  rely on risk -focused supervision for individual institutions , \nwe must continue to work to limit interbank exposures and improve the overall resiliency of our \nfinancial system .  In the United States, for example, major institutions and bank and securities \nsupervisors are taking steps in the post -9/11 environment to ensure that core clearing  and \nsettlement systems and other critical financial market roles can be resumed in the event of \ndisasters or key systems failures.  \nA final element  in macro -prudential su pervision is that  our supervisory policies and rules \nhave consistent and appropriate effects over the business cycle, including our accounting rules, \ncapital standards, provisioning requirements, risk-management practices, and supervisory \nattitudes and app roaches.   Capital and provisioning standards, for example, should reflect a \nlonger -term picture of risk rather than just the most recent  experience or a very optimistic or \npessimistic view of near -term events.   While some have suggested that supervisory po licy could \n\n13 \nbe used more on a countercyclical basis to deal with credit and other market imbalances, I \nbelieve our inability to accurately foresee the future and our need to maintain  consistency \nthroughout the entire supervisory process will leave superviso rs playing a neutral role, at best, \nover the cycle.  \n  \nCan monetary policy supplement macro -prudential supervision?  \nFrom a central bank and monetary policy standpoint, I believe the most important thing \npolicymakers can do is pursue a stable, low -inflation  environment.  Unexpected inflation or \ndeflation clearly disrupts the agreements inherent in longer -term debt contracts and the \ninvestment objectives and plans of individuals and businesses .  If extreme enough, it can spark a \nfinancial crisis.   \nSome, incl uding many at the BIS, have argued that financial crises often stem from \nfinancial imbalances  that build up in the economy, and that there is a role for monetary policy to \nact preemptively to prevent or contain such imbalances.   I would like to comment on that \nposition . \nFirst, as I have suggested, financial crises are by their nature difficult if not impossible to \nanticipate  with any real degree of certainty .  In hindsight , each crisis involves analysis  and an  \nunderstanding of its causes, as well as changes  and corrective steps  that supervis ors and market \nparticipants pursue  to prevent its recurrence .  This means that a similar crisis is unlikely to re-\noccur anytime soon .  However, as the financial system evolves, new vulnerabilities are \nuncovered for which we are not prepared.  If history is any guide, there are scant reasons to \nbelieve that we will be much better prepared at spotting these emerging vulnerabilities than we \nhave been in the past.  Not that we should not try, of course.  But if we grow too sec ure in the \n\n14 \nbelief that we can foresee and prevent crises before they occur, we risk becoming complacent \nprecisely when we should be more vigilant.  For th ese reason s, early  warning models of financial \ncrises based on historical data are unlikely to extrapo late well to future periods, particularly with \nthe rapid changes we are seeing in credit markets.  Indeed, the past few decades have been a \nunique experience  with substantial deregulation in many countries and a relaxation of previous \nconstraints on foreig n capital flows, combined with slow progress in building a new supervisory \nframework.  It is thus not surprising that financial imbalances and crises developed  during this \ntime.  But going forward, in the face of further dramatic changes in the financial s ector, they may \nbe even harder to identify and address in a timely fashion.    \nSecond, even if we have a sense that  financial imbalances  may be emerging , preemptive \nmonetary policy is a very broad tool to be applying effectively to the imbalance.   Most perc eived \nfinancial imbalances occur in a  particular financial market or segment of a market.  For example, \nwhen housing  price  bubbles have occurred in the United States, they have appeared only in a few \nselect cities.  I am unaware of there having been a bubb le in the national housing market.  And \neven in the late 1990s, the “bubble” in equity markets was concentrated in the high-tech sector .  \nThe rest of the stock market did not appear to be overvalued.  Raising interest rates to reduce \nliquidity  is an extrem e response to the possibility of an imbalance in a single segment of our \nfinancial system.  It would risk slowing the economy  when attempting to address a unique \nsegment within it , which is a sizable  risk.  A better response would be more targeted, but suc h \nresponses are beyond the scope of our monetary policy tools.   \nFinally, monetary policy itself is always formed with incomplete information and , given \nthe lag effects of policy actions , could sometimes contribute to imbalances or other \ncircumstances that  aggravate a crisis.  Identifying such circumstances is usually only possible \n\n15 \nwith the benefit of hindsight  and with knowledge of the economy that no one, including \npolicymakers, will have when  policy actions are first taken .  My point here is that the bet ter we \nget at pursuing our long -term monetary policy objectives , the less likely we are to unknowingly \ncontribute to crises .  And  any crises that do arise are likely to be smaller and less damaging.   \nThus, I believe the best we may be able to do to preven t financial crises from a monetary \npolicy standpoint is to aim for stable economic conditions  that will make market imbalances less \nlikely to occur or less severe should they occur.   This is not to ignore the important function of \nmonetary authorities to use open  market or discount  window operations to quell liquidity crises \nand threats to market confidence , much as occurred after the 1987 stock market crash, the 1998 \nRussian debt crisis, and 9/11.       \n \nV. Closing Comments   \n \nI certainly concur with those w ho stress the need to take a systemwide or macro -\nprudential view of financial market supervision.   This has always been important.  And it \nremains important today as we move toward a more market -driven financial system and witness \nrapid growth in capital m arkets.   The l arger institutions, more extensive linkages across \ninstitutions and markets, and more complex financial instruments that inevitably follow these \ndevelopments will further contribute to the need to look at supervision and financial risk on a \nsystemwide basis.  \nI think we have already come far in improving the overall resiliency of our financial \nsystem and limit ing the buildup of common and significant exposures both system wide and \nbetween individual institutions and markets.   In the coming years , we must continue down this \n\n16 \npath.  Monetary policy must also continue playing  a significant  role in ensuring a stable \nenvironment in which the expectations of debtors, creditors, and investors can be realized.  Yet, I \nbelieve that monetary policymakers an d bank supervisors working independently will not be \nenough.  T o accomplish our objectives, they, along with supervisory authorities from all other \nparts of the financial system , will have to work together to share information about risks \ndeveloping in the  institutions and markets under their review.  More than ever before, we will \nneed better communication and coordination to  ensure the financial stability needed to fully \nsupport sustainable economic growth."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n    \nPresented at the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s \n39\nth Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition \nMay 8, 2003 \n\n 1Within our financial system, a bank’s prospects and viability depend on its ability \nto attract investors and customers.  This fundamental need means that banks and bank \nmanagement must operate under the framework of market discipline and in a manner \nthat meets the dictates of market participants.  In other words, market discipline serves as the principal force influencing the performance of our financial markets. \nThe financial revolution we are now experiencing is clearly increasing the \nimportance of market discipline in banking.  Most notably, the removal of many \ntraditional bank regulatory restraints and controls over the past few decades is \nexpanding the role of the marketplace in allocating financial resources, encouraging innovation, and exerting discipline over banks. \nHowever, as the importance of market discipline is increasing, an essential \nprerequisite for effective market discipline – timely and accurate information to guide market participants – is becoming more difficult to achieve, even with the many \nadvances we are making in processing and analyzing financial data.  In particular, the \nongoing financial revolution is contributing to a rapidly growing complexity in financial \ninstruments and services, as demonstrated by the substantial increase in bank trading \nactivities, derivatives, securitization, and global markets.  The increasing size and scope of major institutions also is contributing to this complexity, along with the continuous \nchanges in these institutions’ balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions. \nConsequently, a critical goal for us to explore is how to enhance market \ndiscipline by providing market participants with adequate, timely, and accurate \ninformation for making decisions.  A recent and very important example of this goal is \nthe third pillar of the revised Basel Capital Accord framework.  This pillar seeks to reinforce market discipline by requiring banks to make more effective disclosure of their \nrisk profiles and capital adequacy.  \n\n 2In my comments today, I will focus on the issue of what bank supervisors might \nbe able to do to improve market access to information on banking organizations and to \nthereby enhance financial market discipline.  I will first explore the role of market \ndiscipline in banking and look at recent steps taken to improve bank disclosures and transparency.  Then I will examine what val ue might be added by increased supervisory \ndisclosure and what options bank supervisors have to improve the flow of information to \nbank investors and customers. \n \nThe Role of Market Discipline \nMarket discipline and the related need for information disclosure have a variety of \nmeanings and implications for each of us.  In banking, market discipline can be described most directly through the various ways the market and its participants voice \ntheir views on the performance of a bank’s directors and management.  An extremely \nimportant aspect in this market discipline is the value stockholders place on a bank’s \nequity.  These valuations, in fact, provide a forward-looking guide to how well investors \nexpect a bank and its management to perform.  Equi ty values further reflect the market’s \nview of the safety of a bank’s portfolio, its liquidity, and the expected returns adjusted for \nrisk.  If the market judges management as failing to pursue appropriate risk-return \ntradeoffs, investors will drive a bank’s value below that of other investment choices. \nBank debtholders and large depositors also constitute part of the market \ndiscipline over a bank.  Both debtholders and depositors seek to place their funds in \nsafe, solvent institutions.  Furthermore, they expect to be compensated for any added \nrisks they elect to assume. \nFor bank managers, equity values and the interest rates on deposits and debt \nthus provide signals that cannot be easily ignored, since a manager’s job and \n\n 3compensation will depend on the bank’s performance in these areas.  Declining equity \nvalues and increases in funding costs, for instance, provide a clear indication that a \nbank’s management is failing to meet the competitive standards of the marketplace and \nwill need to improve or be replaced.  This need to satisfy market participants thus constitutes market discipline.  Ultimately, market discipline is the force to which all \nmanagers must answer.  Moreover, market discipline has nothing to do with how well \nsupervisors can read the market or what actions supervisors might take themselves – \ninstead this market force represents the combined views of all market participants. \nSupervisors, though, can play an important role in market discipline by assuring \nthat valid information is brought forward – not only to bank management, but also to the \nmarket itself.  The goal of disclosing such information would be to influence the actions \nof bank management while allowing the market to value bank assets, income streams, and the risk-return equation more accurately.  As a result, examination and other \nsupervisory information, if delivered corre ctly and well, could serve to enhance market \ndiscipline. \n \nRecent Steps to Improve Bank Disclosures \nCurrent bank disclosures largely consist of regulatory reporting requirements; \nSEC disclosure requirements for banking organi zations with publicly traded securities; \nvoluntary disclosures banks make to investors, financial analysts, and rating agencies; \nand disclosures under international accounting standards for banks with foreign operations.  In all of these areas, the demands of investors and customers for more \ninformation --along with technological improvements in information processing -- are \nleading to a number of notable changes in bank disclosure requirements and policies.  It \nis important to understand these changes and their implications for market discipline and \n\n 4bank transparency before going on to look at the options for increasing supervisory \ndisclosure. \nThe amount of information that banks are asked to report in their regulatory \nReports of Condition and Income has continued to expand over the past few decades, and this trend likely will continue.  Banks now report far more detailed information by \nindividual loan categories and in a number of other areas, such as off-balance sheet \nactivities and risk exposures.  Also, from a supervisory perspective, formal regulatory \nenforcement actions and CRA ratings have been disclosed since 1990. \nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and market reactions to Enron and \nother recent accounting scandals are bringing strong pressure for greater and more \naccurate reporting by publicly traded organizations.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, for \ninstance, requires the CEOs and CFOs of all public companies to certify the accuracy of the reports they file with the SEC and comment on the effectiveness of their internal \ncontrols.  This act also directs public companies to disclose material changes on a rapid \nand current basis, shortens the time for reporting insider transactions, strengthens the \nSEC disclosure review process, tightens audit committee requirements, and provides for \ngreater oversight of accounting firms and lim its the non-audit services these firms may \noffer. \nWhile the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation is directed at publicly traded corporations, \nportions of this act will apply to a much larger group of banks.  For instance, FDICIA filing requirements will extend the act’s auditor independence provisions to banks with \nover $500 million in assets, and the banking agencies have proposed extending various \ncorporate governance provisions of the act to nonpublicly traded banks, as appropriate.  \nAs I mentioned earlier, the third pillar of the Basel II Capital Accord will further \nincrease public disclosures by the largest U.S. banks.  Although the final disclosure \nstandards haven’t been specified, the recently released Third Consultative Paper (2003) \n\n 5indicates that large U.S. banks adopting the Basel II framework will be subject to  \nextensive disclosures related to their capital structure, credit risk mitigation, asset \nsecuritization and their assessment of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and \noperational risk.   \nBank supervisors will necessarily have an im portant role to play in each of these \nsteps.  All of these steps, moreover, will help to bring a broader range of information to \ninvestors and bank customers over the next few years and increase the level of scrutiny \nover bank reporting.  However, as banks continue the shift toward more complex and \nactively traded financial instruments, transparency in banking, undoubtedly, will continue to be a challenge. \n \nWhat Unique Information Could Supervisors Bring Forward? \n Because of the banking industry’s systemic role in our economy and given the \ncomplexity of its activities and difficulty with the reporting of these activities, bank \nsupervisors are mandated to engage in a process of formal bank examinations.  These \nexaminations provide supervisors detailed acce ss to bank activities and place them in a \nunique position to collect and analyze banking data. \n In their assessment of banks, for instance, examiners make use of proprietary and internal information at each bank, as well as confidential information on customers – \nall of which is generally unavailable to market participants trying to track an institution’s \ncondition and performance.  The analysis of such information and the steps banks take to control and manage risk, when aggregated, form much of the basis needed to \nunderstand the risk exposures at banks. \n Supervisory agencies also devote ext ensive resources to examining banks and \nhave developed the CAMELS and BOPEC rati ng systems and related procedures for \nanalyzing banking organizations.  These supervisory resources, along with the access to \n\n 6internal information, allow bank examiners to come to factual findings and conclusions \nthat would be of strong interest to bank investors and customers.  Much of this in-depth \nanalysis is not readily available from other independent sources. \n As a result, examiners have a detailed knowledge of individual bank conditions that could prove useful in several ways.  Disclosure of financial positions, risk \nconcentrations, and asset profiles, for instance, could provide a new and valuable \nsource of information to the market.  In addition, examiners would be in a good position \nto identify deficiencies in a bank’s own public disclosures.  \n \nPossible Options for Increasing Supervisory Disclosure \n As we move toward the third pillar of the revised Capital Accord and greater \nreliance on market discipline, some have suggested, and I believe reasonably so, that \nsupervisory information could help the markets be better informed and, thus, enhance market discipline.  There are a number of different ways supervisors could help to \nincrease the level of disclosure in banking and thereby enhance market forces.  Let me \nmention three of the basic approaches that could be followed. \n \nSupervisory Review and Evaluation of a Bank’s Own Disclosures \n One possible initiative would be to have examiners review the adequacy and \naccuracy of a banking organization’s own di sclosures.  Examiners are already being \ndrawn, in part, to this role as they carefully review internal and external sources of \ninformation on a bank or banking organization during an examination and assess the \ninherent risk exposures.  As an example, PNC Financial Services Group restated its 2001 earnings after Federal Reserve examiners objected to the manner in which PNC \nwas accounting for loans that it sold to several subsidiaries.  Most of us believe that \n\n 7examiners should continue to extend this role, as recommended in the 2000 Federal \nReserve Staff Study on “Improving Public Disclosure in Banking.” \n However, there are some questions regarding how far examiners should go in \nreviewing bank disclosures and how they can effectively supplement, rather than duplicate, similar efforts by internal and ex ternal auditors, the SEC, and the new Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board.  In particular, we will have to be careful that we \ndon’t turn bank exams into audits.  Such a step could shortchange the traditional role of  \nexaminers in assessing bank risk exposures and make less than optimal use of \nexamination resources. \n \nDisclosure of Significant or Material Examination Findings \nAs a second option, supervisors could require banks to disclose significant or \nmaterial examination findings.  Although the SEC already requires publicly traded banks \nto disclose any significant news in a time ly manner, different banks have followed \ndifferent practices with regard to disclosing what supervisory items might be considered \nmaterial or useful to the market.  These differences in interpretation and disclosure \npractices may leave some important issues unknown to outside parties.  Disclosure of \nsignificant examination findings could, therefore, help make a bank’s own disclosures \nmore accurate and more reflective of supervisory concerns.  At the same time, the prospect of having to make such disclosures would provide banks with an added \nincentive to monitor and manage their risk ex posures carefully and to comply with \nregulatory objectives.  In other words, such disclosures would certainly facilitate the market’s role. \nTo implement this proposal, examiner s would have to discuss with bank \nmanagement those examination findings considered to be significant.  Such findings \ncould include credit quality problems, serious weaknesses in internal controls and risk \n\n 8management systems, substantial market ri sks, or loan portfolio or activity \nconcentrations.  They could also encompass shortcomings in board or management \nstructure or a failure to maintain adequate capital relative to bank risk exposures.  \nSignificant regulatory violations, as cited by the examiners, should further be disclosed to the public.  The bank or bank holding company, not the examining organization, would \nbe responsible for making the appropriate disclosures or showing that these findings \nwere already reflected in the bank’s reporting. \nIn their conversations, examiners and bankers could also work toward reaching \nan agreement on what descriptive terms would be used to disclose significant examination issues and findings.  This st ep would help ensure that the examining \nagency adequately documents its findings, the bank clearly understands its responsibility \nfor making the disclosures, and market participants are less likely to misinterpret the severity of any problems.  These discussions could further work out ways of disclosing \nweaknesses or problems in sufficient detail, while fully preserving the confidentiality of \ncustomer information.  In addition, bankers should be given an opportunity to report \nsupplemental information to the public, along with what steps they plan to take to \naddress supervisory issues. \nOverall, the disclosure of important  examination findings and the underlying \ndiscussions between bankers and examiners could help provide for a constructive, and \nat times intense, dialogue among bankers, the market, and supervisory authorities.  I would also note that this disclosure option could help to reduce the severity of many of \nthe problems identified by examiners, sinc e bankers would be encouraged to disclose \nand begin addressing these problems at an early stage.  The disclosure of examination findings further represents a natural outgrowth  of the examination process, and it would \nhelp provide greater consistency to the information publicly traded banks should already \nbe disclosing under SEC regulations. \n\n 9A final implementation question concerns which banks should be required to \ndisclose key examination findings – just the large complex banking organizations, all \npublicly traded banking organizations, or every bank.  Because all publicly traded \nbanking organizations are already required by  the SEC to disclose any significant or \nmaterial findings, such organizations would provide a logical starting point.  These \norganizations report to investors on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when \nnecessary.  Depending on the importance of examination findings, these organizations \ncould make the relevant disclosures in their next quarterly report or, if more urgent, \nthrough special press releases.  For nonpublicly traded smaller banks, the disclosure of important examination findings is more problem atic.  The stock of these institutions often \nis closely held or not widely traded, so there is no ready means to foster disclosure in a \nsystematic way. \n \nDisclosure of Bank Examination Ratings   \n Another option for consideration is the disclosure of bank or holding company \nexamination ratings.  Since examination ra tings reflect the assessments of experienced \nexaminers, disclosure of these ratings might provide important insights regarding the \ncondition of banks. \n However, I am less comfortable with disclosing examination ratings than with the disclosure of significant supervisory findings.  In fact, there are a number of issues \nassociated with ratings disclosure that will need further study and discussion.  Most \nimportant, examination ratings are designed for the internal use of the banking agencies.  They come with little explanation, little dialogue with the bank and one typically needs \nconsiderably more information than can be provided to the market to fully understand the \nanalysis behind the rating.  \n\n 10 If examination ratings were to be publicly disclosed without significant additional \ndata and commentary, several significant problems could arise.  A major concern, for \ninstance, would be possible overreactions by market participants whenever they fail to \ncorrectly interpret exam ratings.  Also, examinations could become less useful for supervisory purposes if circumstance required examiners to simplify the ratings system \nand its underlying analysis.  Another potential difficulty would be maintaining reasonably \nconsistent ratings across banks, given existi ng differences in bank activities, size of \noperations, and primary supervisors.  One other critical concern is whether the \ndisclosure of examination ratings would serve to replace, reduce or be confounded with private market sources of information and analysis – an outcome, that could weaken \nrather than enhance the market’s role. \n I also am concerned that the assignment of examination ratings, in part, may be backward looking, focusing on what bank management has previously done instead of \nwhere a bank is now headed.  For example, examiners may continue to rate a bank \nadversely after it begins to take appropriate steps to address past problems – a good \nreason for doing so is to ensure close supervisory oversight of the bank until it fully \nrecovers.  To the extent this occurs, the disclosure of examination could involve misunderstandings in the market and, thus, fail to provide a positive force guiding \nongoing activities. \n I recognize that supervisors have taken significant steps in recent years to make examinations more risk-focused and reflective of current and prospective risk exposures.  \nI also recognize that examiners could disclose to the market some of the supplemental \ninformation behind their ratings, but I doubt that this would be sufficient, or even possible, in all cases and could lead the market to an incorrect view of a bank.  I believe \nsuch problems could largely be avoided by focusing disclosures on significant \nexamination findings and related information rather than the ratings themselves. \n\n 11 \nConcluding Comments \n A variety of factors are increasing the importance of market discipline and \ninformation disclosure in banking.  The financial revolution that is now taking our banking \nindustry into many new directions is giving the market a growing role in determining what \nbanks do, how they do it, and what their rewards will be.  In return, we have seen the \nbanking industry become more innovative and responsive to the needs of financial customers and investors.  However, for all of this market process to work and to foster a \nsound and capable banking industry, market participants must have access to accurate, \ncomprehensive, and timely information.  This need for information, moreover, is occurring at the same time that banking and financial products are becoming more \ncomplex and, in many ways, more opaque.  \n Although bank supervisors must be very careful in defining the role they will play in financial markets, they could inject a key source of transparency into the market \nprocess.  Most notably, supervisors have access to a variety of information at banks, \nincluding both public and confidential data.  In addition, supervisors expend substantial \nresources in analyzing this information and assessing the condition of individual banks. \n As a result, increased disclosure of supervisory information could be of significant value to the market and is consequently a topic that deserves further thought \nand study by all of us.  I believe that one supervisory option -- requiring publicly traded \nbanks to disclose any significant weakne sses or material findings identified by \nexaminers -- could be readily incorporated into examination and disclosure policies and \ncould greatly help to enhance the effectiveness of market discipline."

            "content": "1 Realizing Our Potential: \nThe Outlook for The U. S. Economy \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \nOmaha \nApril 12, 2001 \n \n \n I appreciate this opportunity, today, to shar e my views with you on the outlook for the \nU.S. economy. As you know, much has happened in the economy over the past twelve \nmonths. At this time last year, we we re celebrating the economy’s exceptional \nperformance. The longest business expansion in history had resulted in strong economic \ngrowth, rising employment and real income, a booming stock market, and lower inflation. \nSo good was the economy’s performance we were to ld that we were in an era of a \"New \nEconomy\" and traditional business cycles were a thing of the past.  Over the past few months, we have seen an abrupt turn of events. Growth has slowed \ndramatically as consumer spending and bus iness investment spending have weakened, \njob losses have mounted, the stock market ha s declined, and higher energy prices have \npushed up inflation. There is now widespr ead concern about the current economic \nsituation and greater uncertainty  about the longer-term outlook. \n Today, I would like to offer my views on the economic outlook and on the prospects for a \nreturn to strong, noninflationary growth. In the near term, I am cautiously optimistic. \nWhile there are certainly downside risks to the short-run outlook, th ere are encouraging \nsigns that economic conditions are stabilizi ng. Consequently, I believe we are likely to \nsee an improving economy by the second half of the year. Over the longer term, I am \neven more optimistic that we can realize th e economy’s potential if we can continue to \nachieve strong productivity gain s and if we pursue fiscal and monetary policies that \npromote economic growth. Before turning to these longer run issues, let me begin my \ndiscussion with a closer l ook at the near-term outlook. \n The Outlook for 2001  By almost any measure, the U.S economy ha s turned in an exceptional performance over \nthe past decade. We have experienced st rong growth in output and employment, low \ninflation, and a dramatic increase  in stock prices. To put this  performance in perspective, \nconsider that when the last recession ende d in 1991 we had an unemployment rate that \nwas rising toward 8 percent, a core CPI inflation rate of ove r 4 percent, and the S&P 500 \nstock index was under 400. Last year, the unemp loyment rate fell below 4 percent, core \ninflation was 2 ½ percent, and the S&P 500 reached an all-time high of almost 1500.  \n\n2 Over the past six months, however, the ec onomy has slowed dramatically. Where real \nGDP growth averaged over 5 percent in the firs t half of last year, second half growth was \nonly about 1½ percent. Indeed, fourth quarter growth of 1 percent wa s the slowest in five \nyears. Two key factors behind the slowdown were the sharp reductions in consumer and \nbusiness investment spending. Consumers were adversely affected by a number of factors \nincluding a weaker stock market, the rapid rise in energy prices , and higher interest rates. \nIn addition, business investment spending weakened after businesses completed Y2K \nprojects and as investment in Internet -related and telecommunications activities \ncollapsed. The business slowdown hit manufactur ing industries especially hard as firms \ncut back production and employment to deal  with lower sales a nd rising inventories. \n Consequently, at the beginning of this year , the economic outlook looked quite weak, and \nthere was increased talk  in the news media that the slow down might turn into a recession. \nIn this environment, and with inflationary  pressures generally contained, the Federal \nReserve began a series of easing actions desi gned to provide additi onal liquidity to the \nbanking system and to lower interest rates. With two 50-basis-point reductions in January \nand an additional 50-point reduction in Marc h, the target federal funds rate has been \nreduced from 6 ½ percent to 5 percent and bot h short and long-term interest rates have \nfallen as a result.   Over the past two months, economic conditions  appear to have stabilized somewhat. You \ncertainly don’t see this yet in the stock mark et where stock prices continue to be under \npressure from lower earnings estimate s. However, housing and nonresidential \nconstruction have shown continued strengt h, consumer spending on autos and other \ndurable goods has bounced back somewhat, and consumer confidence, after falling sharply, appears to have stabilized. Conse quently, many forecasters have now upped their \nestimates of first quarter growth from negative territory to around 1 pe rcent, and talk of a \npossible recession has diminished.  While the outlook for the remainder of the year remains uncertain, my own views are \nsimilar to those of many other forecasters. I expect growth in the second quarter to \nremain weak as manufacturers continue to  hold back production to eliminate inventory \nimbalances. With slow employment growth, we are likely to see some further increase in \nthe unemployment rate over the next few m onths. The economy should strengthen in the \nsecond half of the year, however , and I currently expect growth to move back toward 2 ½ \nor 3 percent over the final two quarters.   Three factors are likely to contribute to st ronger second half gr owth. First, once the \ncurrent inventory adjustment is complete , businesses should return to more normal \nproduction schedules, which will stimulate  output and employment. Second, over time \nthe effects of lower interest rates should sp read through interest-sensitive sectors of the \neconomy, and the lower cost of funds should encourage higher consumer and business \nspending. Third, fiscal policy is likely to be quite stimulative. The expected passage of a \ntax cut should provide a boost to consumer sp ending and perhaps help solidify consumer \nconfidence as well. In addition, federal gove rnment spending is likely to increase as \nCongress and the Administration spend pa rt of the growi ng budget surplus. \n\n3  \nAt the same time, though, my optimism is tempered somewhat by the presence of some significant downside risks. As the Federal Op en Market Committee indicated in its most \nrecent press release, these downside risks to the economy warrant continued monitoring \nof economic developments that might indicate that the economy is weaker than expected. \n In my view, the principal concern is that consumer spending may not be as strong as \nforecast. Over the past several years, consum ers have spent far in excess of their current \nincomes. This is reflected in both a negativ e saving rate and increased indebtedness. If \nconsumers decide to retrench in  order to build up savings or  cut back debt, the short-run \neffect will reduce the stimulus to the economy in coming months. An additional factor is \nthe potential impact of a weak stock market on consumer spending. To the extent that the \nrobust stock market over the past few years helped fuel consumer spending, the recent \nstock market weakness may dampen spending go ing forward. I also believe that we need \nto keep close tabs on the energy situation. If  energy costs do not come down as expected, \nboth consumer confidence and consumer spending may be slow to recover.  A second downside risk is possible weakness in business investment spending. Strong \nbusiness investment spending has been a key factor in the growth of the economy over \nthe past few years and has been especially important in the rapid productivity increases \nthat we have experienced recently. Given the sharp slowing in investment spending in the \npast two quarters, the development of excess capacity in manufacturing, and the \nweakness in the Internet and telecommunicati ons sectors, there is some concern that \ninvestment spending might not be as strong as expected. \n A third downside risk is the possibility that the world economy might not grow as rapidly \nas anticipated. Slower growth in Europe, South America and Asia could weaken U.S. \nexports, which would lower our domestic growth  and also could lead to a worsening of \nour trade imbalance.  Despite these risks, I continue to be cauti ously optimistic about the near term outlook. I \nbelieve that the economy is sufficiently sound to  weather the current turmoil and that we \nare likely to see increased signs of  economic strength in coming months. \n The Longer Run Outlook  Let me turn now to the longer run outlook fo r the economy over the next several years. \nThe key question is whether we can return to  the strong, noninflationa ry growth path of \nrecent years. I am very optimistic that we can  if we continue to have strong productivity \ngrowth and if we pursue appropriate  fiscal and monetary policies. \n Productivity Is Key  Productivity is critical ly important. With productivity increases, businesses can produce \nmore output with given labor and capital input s or, equivalently, the same output can be \nproduced with fewer inputs or at lower cost.  \n\n4  \nProductivity is the key to noni nflationary growth. When ec onomic growth is entirely \ndemand-driven, inflationary pressures tend to ri se as capacity is more fully utilized and \nsupply limits are reached. When demand grow th is accompanied by productivity gains, \nhowever, additional capacity is added and inflationary pressures are mitigated.  Over the past several years, we have seen very rapid demand growth spurred by \nconsumer spending. We have not experienced serious inflationary pressures, however, \nbecause we have also seen very strong produc tivity growth. Indeed, over the past five \nyears, growth of nonfarm business productivity  has averaged 2.6 percent. In contrast, \nover the previous 25 years, productivity growth was only 1.6 percent.  How can we achieve continued productivity  growth over the long term? The key is \nbusiness investment that incorporates new technologies. Thus, it is extremely important \nto have an economic environment supportive of the creation of new technologies and \nwhere businesses have the incentive to make the necessary investme nts to bring these \nnew technologies to the market.  With the recent slowing of business investme nt spending, the decline in the stock market, \nand the bursting of the Internet/DotCom bubbl e, some doubts have emerged as to the \nstrength of the environment for investment  spending. And if investment spending is \nweak, what are the prospect s for long-term productivity? \n I would certainly agree that i nvestment spending is likely to  be somewhat weaker going \nforward. Business preparations for Y2K provi ded a strong boost to investment spending \nthat will not be repeated. Moreover, industr ies with excess production capacity currently \nwill have little immediate need to expa nd capacity as sales and economic activity \nstrengthen.  However, I don’t think that this necessarily means that we will see a significant slowing \nof long-term productivity, for two reasons. Fi rst, businesses will continue to have an \nincentive to invest in new cost-saving t echnologies. In a highly competitive global \nmarketplace, businesses have litt le pricing power. In this e nvironment, the key to higher \nearnings and profitability is th e ability to control or reduce costs. And, investment in new \ntechnologies that improve pr oduction, distribution, and ot her work processes is the \nprincipal way of generating significant cost savings. Thus, I believe that businesses will \ncontinue to have a strong incentive to  make productivity-enhancing investments. \n Second, I don’t think that we have seen all of  the productivity benefits arising from the \nsurge in investment spending over the past fe w years. As I talk to people in the IT \nindustry and to businesses that are heavy IT users, I have the impression that much of the \nrecent surge in investment spending was driv en by Y2K needs and by peer pressure to \nstay abreast of technol ogy trends rather than  by explicit cost-saving objectives. If so, then \nbusinesses that have made these investment s are likely to devote considerable energy, \ngoing forward, to making these investments pa y off in terms of higher productivity. Thus, \n\n5 I am optimistic that we can continue to s ee strong productivity growth over the next \nseveral years even with sl ower investment spending. \n Fiscal and Monetary Policies for Growth  The environment for investment and growth will also depend critically on whether we \npursue appropriate fiscal and monetary polic ies in the years ahea d. Businesses are better \nable to make long-term investment decisi ons in a macroeconomic environment with a \nlow and stable inflation rate and low interest  rates. Sound fiscal and monetary policies are \nessential to this end.  Currently, the budget surplus provides us with a tremendous opportunity to accomplish a number of important economic and social obj ectives. While the ultimate choice on how \nto use the surplus will involve a balancing of competing political  views, I believe that it is \nuseful to highlight those fis cal actions that can contribu te most to long-run economic \ngrowth.  One way of promoting growth is to use part  of the surplus to pa y down the outstanding \nnational debt. Government borrowing competes directly with private sector borrowing for \nthe supply of savings and tends to drive up interest rates. Re ducing the supply of \ngovernment debt will promote growth by loweri ng interest rates a nd stimulating private \ninvestment spending.   An additional benefit of reducing the supply of government debt is that this action lowers \nthe tax burden on future generations who w ill be responsible for making interest and \nprincipal payments on this debt. This may be particularly desirable given the large burden \nthat is likely to be placed on future generations by the need to  fully fund social security in \nthe latter half of the century.  A second option that also would promote growth  is to use the surplus to reduce taxes. \nWhile much of the recent discussion of tax cu ts has focused on the short-run stimulus to \nthe economy, lower taxes, in the form of reducti ons in marginal tax rates, can contribute \nto longer run growth as well. One way th at lower tax rates promote growth is by \nincreasing incentives to work and invest. Lo wer tax rates also remove distortions and \ninefficiencies resulting from tax avoidance be havior. In addition, part of a tax cut likely \nwill be saved, and the increased supply of saving will flow to private borrowers to finance new investment spending.  Finally, monetary policy will most certainly play  a key role in ensuring a return to strong, \nnoninflationary growth. The recent actions ta ken by the Federal Reserve will provide a \nshort-term stimulus to the economy by lo wering borrowing costs and by contributing to \nincreased consumer and business confidence. Over the longer run, if we are to have \ngrowth without inflation, the Federal Reserve must maintain its commitment to price stability by ensuring that demand grows in  line with increases in the economy’s \nproductive capacity. This means, of course, that policy will need to be tightened in \nsituations in which demand growth threatens to exceed supply growth and eased, as in the \n\n6 current situation, when demand growth weaken s. I believe that the Federal Reserve has \nbeen successful in this endeavor over the past several years, and I am confident that this \nsuccess will continue in the future.   Concluding Comments  Let me close with a brief summary of my views on the economic outlook. Although the \ncurrent slowdown in the economy is a serious con cern, it is likely to be relatively brief, \nand growth should strengthen in the second ha lf of the year. I also recognize that there \nare down side risks that could sl ow the recovery. At the same time, I continue to be very \noptimistic about the longer-run outlook. Long- term productivity growth is likely to \ncontinue to be strong as bus inesses invest in new cost-s aving technologies. Moreover, \nwith low inflation and a sizable  budget surplus, we are in a fortunate situation that gives \nus considerable flexibility in the use of m acroeconomic policies to enable us to realize \nour long-run economic potential."

            "content": "1 THE BENEFITS OF AN OPEN ECONOMY \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \nPresented to the Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce \nKansas City \n \nJanuary 22, 2000 \n \n We are in the midst of a vibrant, some even say booming, U.S. economy. Economies of \ncountries worldwide are improving as well. Yet one issue has emerged that is both \nstriking and troublesome: Within some quarter s, there is renewed opposition to free and \nopen trade.   We recently saw an example of this in Seattle during the worl d trade talks, where various \neconomic and political forces worked to im pede progress toward opening more doors to \nglobal trade. And I suspect the heated deba te over open trade will only intensify in the \ncoming months.  As strong as world economies are right now, the United States is running a sizeable \ncurrent account deficit. This deficit is givi ng some people concern regarding our policies \nthat encourage open trade. A nd it is true that against t oday’s backdrop of an improving \nworld economy, there are economic differences  among the world’s people. Some critics \nclaim free trade is the cause of these differences, and they  question the wisdom of open \nmarkets.   But my message to you this evening is this : Such reasoning is s hortsighted. The United \nStates and the rest of the world have benefited greatly over recent decades from \nembracing free trade. We in the United States have worked hard to open our markets to \nthe rest of the world and to expand our unive rse of trading partners. Now is not the time \nto back away from our commitment to free trade.      The State of The Economy  There is no question that our nation’s economy is strong—even booming. During the \nthird quarter, GDP grew at an annual rate of  5.7 percent. Fourth quarter GDP is estimated \nto approach 5 percent, a momentum that  should literally launch us into the new \nmillennium. Our personal consumption has stay ed consistently above 6 percent, while \n\n2 business fixed investment has grown at doubl e-digit rates. Sales of new and existing \nhomes, while showing signs of slowing, remain solid. Unemployment has sunk to 4.1 percent, its lowest mark in 30 years. And the performance of the U.S. stock market \ncontinues to amaze us. Yet, core inflation was ju st 1.9 percent last year, its tamest level in \ndecades.  Yes, to put it simply, the U.S. economy is sound, and the outlook is good.  Of course, there are imbalances in any ec onomic picture which necessarily complicate \nour view of the horizon. For example, the cons umer savings rate continues to slip. An \ninteresting reflection of this is owners’ equi ty share of household real estate, which now \nstands at 55 percent, down from about 65 perc ent in just the past ten years. Household \ndebt as a share of disposable personal in come has reached 99 percent, a new historic \nhigh. On a broader scale, gross private savings  less gross private domestic investment in \nthe United States is now a negative 3 percen t of GDP, down from its  long-run average of \na positive 2 percent. Corporate debt is once again rising to historically high marks, \ncresting above 70 percent of GDP. Private-sect or debt as a share of GDP is nearly 145 \npercent, another all-time high. The increasing amount of leverage within our economy is \nreflected in our current account deficit, wh ich is expected to exceed $300 billion in 1999, \nnearly 4 percent of GDP.   If these imbalances were to get out of  hand, of course, they could undermine our \nconfidence in our economy and affect the ec onomic outlook. But the fact is, imbalances \nare an inevitable part of a large economy. It’s no mystery that we need to remain alert to \nthese trends and to keep our engines tuned for our economy to run smoothly.  \n \nThe Current Account Balance and Free Trade \n As I said earlier, some critics point to our current account deficit and see only harm \ncoming from it. They question the wisdom of open markets and free trade, and they argue \nthat the United States should not act as the \"c onsumer of last resort \" for the rest of the \nworld. They warn of a growing danger for cer tain sectors within our economy, and they \nclaim that having opened U.S. markets to the rest of the world we are undermining our \neconomic growth and paying for other countri es’ prosperity with American jobs.  \n Ironically, many of these same people question wh ether the rest of th e world can continue \nto feed our appetite for imported goods and meet our need for international credit.  \n These kinds of fears, by their very nature, en courage protectionist sentiment that call for \nclosing our doors to inte rnational trade and the protection of jobs.  \n But doing so would be a grave mistake. Like  bleeding the patient, closing our doors to \ntrade would do far more harm than good.   Throughout history, even before Adam Smith wrote his famous The Wealth of Nations \nsome 200 years ago, economic thinkers have  repeatedly shown that open trade helps \n\n3 countries systematically raise their levels  of wealth and income. Issues of job \ndisplacement and transition represent legi timate concerns. But as world trade has \nexpanded we have dealt successf ully with these issues, a nd in the end, added to both \nwealth and jobs.  Let’s take a moment to consider some key facts.  In 1947, one of the first postwar  trade agreements was the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade, or GATT, the predecessor of  today's World Trade Organization. GATT \nreflected the leadership of the United States in an expanding system of world trade. Since \nthen, the average tariff in the United States has shrunk from about 20 percent to just 5 \npercent. Most of these gains have been passe d on to consumers, raising our standard of \nliving. Also since 1947, the United States has remained perhaps the wealthiest, most \ninnovative, and most successful na tion in the world’s history. \n Since the first GATT agreement, the growth of real GDP in the United States has averaged nearly 3.5 percent per year. Mean while, our real per capita GDP has surged \nfrom under $10,000 in 1947 to nearly $30,000 today. For more than 180 other countries of the United Nations, average real GDP growth  since 1947 has even exceeded that of the \nUnited States.  In 1995, noted Harvard economist Jeffrey S achs and his colleague Andrew Warner \nstudied the effects of trade policies in dozens of countries . Sachs is one of the most \nrespected economists in the worl d and has served as an econo mic advisor to countries in \nLatin America, Eastern Europe, the Former  Soviet Union, Africa and Asia. Among the \ncountries reviewed, he and Warner found th at developed nations with open economies \ngrew about 2 ¼ percent annually from 1970 to  1990, while developed nations with closed \neconomies grew a meager 0.7 percent. The c ontrast among developing nations is even \nstarker. Developing nations with open ec onomies grew about 4 ½ percent, while \ndeveloping nations with closed economies gr ew less than 1 percent. Countries that \nswitched from closed to open economies sa w their growth rates climb on average by \nmore than a full percen tage point a year.  \n In addition to these facts, consider that de spite their recent financial woes, South Korea, \nSingapore, and Hong Kong—countries that ha ve opened their doors to trade—are far \nwealthier than countries with  closed economies. It is no coincidence that these three \ncountries have grown two to four times fast er than India, Brazil,  and Mexico—countries \nthat have been slower to open their doors to trade.  In Hong Kong, real per capita GDP has soar ed from a U.S. equivalent of $3,000 in 1970 \nto $18,000 today. In China, that same meas ure of wealth has grown from $100 to $800—\nand most of that increase has come in the pa st ten years, as China has finally begun to pry \nopen its doors.  In other words, what this information and hist ory show is that trad e is good for everyone. \nThe U.S. current account reflects how much Americans have benefited from the world’s \n\n4 willingness to meet our demand for goods, to hold our debt, and to invest in our projects. \nIt also reflects how the rest of the world ha s benefited from our w illingness to buy their \ngoods. Indeed, events of the past couple of years have shown how trading partnerships \nhelped developing nations pull themselves ou t of financial troubl e, thus averting a \nworldwide economic crisis that would have harmed us all.   In short, free trade—a voluntary exchange  of goods—benefits everyone. I am confident \nthat our standard of living in the United States  would be far lower, and our inflation rate \nfar higher, if we were ope rating in a trade vacuum. \n Free Trade and Prosperity  I am not suggesting that enhancing wealth is the only goal of a society in building \ninternational trade relatio nships. Obviously, other le gitimate concerns become \nintertwined with matters of trade polic y—for example, labor rights and working \nconditions, or the effects of industrial deve lopment on the world’s environment. These \nare important issues, without question.   But I would argue that the best approach to ad dressing these kinds of issues is separately \nfrom the trade process but on a parallel pa th. For example, the relationships between \ntrade and labor standards we re studied by the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development in 1996. The OECD found that trade reforms, if sustained, lead to \nimprovements in labor standards. That is , rising labor standards are the result of \neconomic growth—not the cause—and that free tr ade is one of the main ways to bring \nabout this result.   \nMy point is that such issues  can be most effectively resolved, as incomes and wealth \nincrease, and as nations become more financ ially able to face such problems. This has \nbeen our approach in the United States for r oughly the past 50 years. It has worked well \nfor us, and it should work we ll for the rest of the world. \n I also am not suggesting that the act of removing trade barrie rs, by itself, assures a nation \nof prosperity. Any society that wishes to  improve its economic well-being must first \nembrace a host of other economic and legal prin ciples beyond open trade. A country must \nhave a legal and market infrastructure in pl ace to handle economic transactions. It must \nhave the rule of law and contracts. Its pe ople must be educated. And its fiscal and \nmonetary mechanisms must work.  In other words, a country must develop certain internal systems. Only then can prosperity \nflow from negotiating fair agreements with  other countries to open markets to new \ncompetition. The country then must devel op ways of building products, and employing \nand redeploying resources most productivel y. And, of course, prosperity requires a \nsystem that provides incentives to  work, to save, and to invest. \n Conclusion  \n\n5 In the future, the United States, as well as nations around the world, will face changes \nand challenges to our economic well-being. This is a simple fact of life. But our \nsuccesses will depend on how we c hoose to react to those events. If we react with barriers \nto trade, if we engage in a \"beggar th y neighbor\" policy, we will surely falter. Our \nincomes will shrink. And our prosperity will suffer, as will that of our neighbors.   On the other hand, if we react with confiden ce in our market mechanisms, with patience \nand foresight, we will prosper—both now and in  the long run, as we have in the past. \n Finally, if I leave you with no other point this evening, let it be that any country that has \nworked hard to build and maintain its pros perity, or has gone fr om an underdeveloped \nnation to a developed one, that country’s  economy and society have been outward \nlooking. How sad it would be if we let our su ccess convince us that we can afford to \nabandon our commitment to open trade."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n   \nPresented to the Conference: \nLessons from Recent Global Financial Crises \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago \n \nOctober 1, 1999 \n   Over the past two decades, we have seen an increased incidence of financial crises, both in industrialized countries and in emerging market economies. These crises have not only disrupted the financial systems in affected c ountries but also have had severe effects on \neconomic activity. Appropriately, much of  the focus of this conference is on \nunderstanding the causes of these crises a nd on developing appropr iate public policy \nresponses.   \nAs we discuss these issues, however, we must  avoid being caught up in a search for quick \nfix remedies for financial crises. Rather, I belie ve that it is essential to maintain a broad \nperspective on the ongoing changes in the fina ncial system and the scope for effective \npublic policy.   Generally speaking, financial regulatory policy involves choo sing an appropriate tradeoff \nbetween the objectives of efficiency and financial stability. Our primary tools for \nachieving these objectives are re gulation, prudential supervis ion, and market discipline. \nIn recent years, changing financial mark ets along with deregulation and financial \nliberalization have caused us to rethink our views on the appropriate weights that we \nattach to our policy objectives. Our prin cipal task, going forward, is to find a new \nequilibrium.   As part of this task, we need to strike a new balance in the use of  regulation, supervision, \nand market discipline to achieve  our policy goals. I th ink it is clear that we cannot return \nto, and probably do not want to return to, the highly regulated and segmented financial \nsystems of the past. We do want to give greate r scope to the market to guide the evolution \nof the financial system. At the same time, we recognize that we cannot totally rely on \nmarket discipline because of moral hazard and safety net concerns and because the public \nis likely to have limited tolerance for financial crises in the future.  \n\n2  \nMoreover, as we proceed, we need to r ecognize the new realities  of the financial \nlandscape. Financial institutions will continue  to increase in size, traditional boundaries \nbetween intermediaries will continue to disappear, new and more complex financial \nproducts will be developed, and cross-border lin kages will increase. At the same time, the \nsafety net is likely to expand as deposit in surance protection is extended to a broader \nrange of activities and institutions and as more financial institutions become too big to fail.  In this environment, it is clear that a rede sign of regulatory policie s will center on two \nquestions: how can we make greater use of market discipline, and how can we adapt \nregulation and supervisory procedures to the new realities? In the final analysis, the \nfinancial system of the future is likely to be more vibrant and efficient but, also, more \nprone to occasional crises. Rea listically, then, our goal will not be to eliminate financial \ncrises but, rather, to limit their impact and to  develop principles and procedures for their \norderly resolution.  In my remarks, today, I would like to devel op these thoughts in somewhat more detail. I \nwill begin with a brief discussion of recent fina ncial crises and the need to strike a new \nbalance among financial regula tion, supervision, and market di scipline. Then, I will focus \nmore closely on the scope for greater mark et discipline and on how we might adapt \nregulation and supervision to ongoing change s in financial markets. Finally, I will \nexplore some of the implications of these ch anges for the design of public policy to deal \nwith financial crises in the future.  What's Behind Recent Financial Crises? \n \nOver the past two decades, a large number of countries have experienced a serious financial crisis that has weakened the ba nking system, reduced credit availability, and \nslowed economic growth. These crises have taken many forms: from the S&L crisis in \nthe U.S., to the real estate and banking crises  in some of the Nordic countries and Japan, \nto the banking and currency crises in Cent ral and Latin America and in Southeast Asia. \nThe social cost of many of these crises has b een significant, both in terms of the financial \ncost of restoring the banking system to h ealth and in terms of lost output and higher \nunemployment in the affected countries. In addition, many of  these crises have spilled \nover to other countries through currency a nd asset markets and through disruption of \ntrade.   One possible explanation of the increased incide nce of financial crises is that we have \nexperienced larger economic shocks in recen t years. While the in creased volatility of \ninterest rates and asset prices over the past two decades lends some support to this view, \nother evidence points toward a more structur al explanation. Indeed, as economists and \npolicymakers have looked at these crises mo re closely, some important stylized facts \nhave emerged. Although each crisis clearly has unique, country-specific features, there is \na growing body of evidence pointing toward some common elements. In many instances, a crisis was preceded by a rapid expansion in credit availability that was in turn \n\n3 associated with a prior effort to liberalize th e financial system. Moreove r, a closer look at \nthe banking system in the aftermath of the cris is has generally revealed a pattern of weak \ncredit review by banks, specu lative activities, high levera ge, and weak regulatory and \nsupervisory controls. These stylized facts seem  to fit a number of di verse situations: from \nthe U.S. S&L crisis, to the Mexican and Japa nese banking problems, to the currency and \nbanking crises in Southeast Asia. The presen ce of these common elements suggests, to \nme, that the root cause of the recent crises may lie in the design of our financial regulatory system and in the difficulty of adapting this system to ongoing changes in \nfinancial markets.  The Need for a New Balance  In the United States and ma ny other countries, policymakers have traditionally placed \nheavy emphasis on financial stability as a goa l of public policy. Thus , historically, they \nhave tended to rely on regulation and prudent ial supervision rather than on market \ndiscipline to ensure the safe ty and soundness of the banking system. While this approach \nworked well in periods where financial mark et change was slow and evolutionary, it \nproved inadequate in the face of rapid tec hnological change in financial services, \nincreased competition between regulated and unregulated institutions, and the breakdown of geographic barriers to the pr ovision of financial services.  \n Policymakers responded to these changes in  a variety of ways. In some cases, \nderegulation and financial liberalization were s een as necessary to allow market forces to \nplay a greater role in shaping the evolution of the financial system. This was done both to \nensure the continued health of financial in stitutions exposed to increased competition and \nto take better advantage of the benefits pr omised by new financial services. In addition, \npolicymakers recognized the need to moderni ze and adapt regulation and supervision to \nbetter reflect developments in financial markets.  Unfortunately, in many countries, the combina tion of changing financial markets and an \naltered regulatory structure created a disequi librium in the financial system. Market \ndiscipline and its necessa ry ingredients did not develop qui ckly enough to contain the risk \ntaking of institutions no longer adequately c onstrained by the traditional regulatory and \nsupervisory framework. Moreover, it proved more  difficult than originally anticipated to \nadapt regulation and prudential supervision to  the changing financial marketplace. Such \nan environment, I suggest, has made fi nancial systems more vulnerable to the \ndevelopment of financial crises such as those experienced in recent years. \n Going forward, the main tasks for policymakers are to rethink what is an acceptable tradeoff between efficiency and financial stabil ity and to strike a new balance in the use \nof regulation, supervision, and market discipline to achieve  these goals. These are by no \nmeans easy tasks. We recognize that there is no going back to a framework of segmented \nfinancial markets and tight re gulatory control over deposit  rates, bank expansion, and \nbanking activities. And, we acknowledge the need to give greater scope to market forces \nin guiding the evolution of  the financial system.  \n \n\n4 The difficulty with all this, however, is that  we now operate in an environment with \nlarger and more complex financial institutio ns whose potential failure threatens the \nsolvency of existing insurance funds and may pose risks to the payments system. \nMoreover, in today's freewheeling financial markets, herd mentality may apply market \ndiscipline abruptly and at inconvenient times, punishing in stitutions and individual \nconsumers rather than control ling their risk taking. Thus, while we wish to enjoy the \nbenefits of a market-driven financial system, we may not  be comfortable with the \nconsequences when markets are disrupted or when financial institutions seem likely to fail. Few supervisory authorities will want to be responsible for the type of economic \ndisruption recently seen in Southeast Asia a nd even fewer will want  to risk starting a \nglobal financial crisis.  Consequently, another reality of the operating environment is that we will be forced to \nrely more on public safety nets and \"too big to fail\" policies than most of us would prefer. \nUnfortunately, this also means that we will still be faced with significant moral hazard \nissues within our financial system. Bank credito rs and others that ar e protected by safety \nnets will not have sufficient incentives to thoroughly select institutions, and consequently, there will be limits as to how fa r market discipline can work in controlling \nrisk taking.  How, then, should we proceed? Let me turn next to a more detailed discussion of the scope for greater use of market discipline as well as some of the practical difficulties of adapting regulation and supervision to these new realities. I should note at the outset that, \nwhile much of my discussion of  specific policies and procedures  is most relevant to the \nU.S. financial system, the underlying prin ciples have more general application. \n \nHow Can We Make Greater Use of Market Discipline? \n In general, I am very sympathetic to the view that policymakers must place increased \nreliance on market discipline. Market discipli ne is clearly necessary if our financial \nsystem is to have the appropriate incentiv es, and disincentives, gui ding its evolution and \ndevelopment.  We should also recognize, though, that our co ntinued reliance on public safety nets and \n\"too big to fail\" policies will necessarily temp er the use of market discipline. In fact, it \nwill be difficult to escape these limitations, give n the externalities that exist in banking. \nPublic protection may also be needed because of the learning curve that market participants and regulators will face in our rapidly changing financial environment. Therefore, the critical ques tion is not whether we should move toward greater market \ndiscipline, to which the answer is yes. Inst ead, we must ask ourselves how we can make \nmarket discipline more effective within the context of public safety nets.  Undoubtedly, the most important step we can ta ke toward enhancing market discipline is \nto encourage more accurate and detailed disclo sures of financial info rmation. I regard full \nfinancial disclosure as the pr erequisite or the underpinning for an effective system of \n\n5 market discipline, since it is the key factor that guides the decisi ons of bank stockholders, \ndebtholders, depositors, and other customers. \n There are a number of areas where financia l institutions could look to improve their \ndisclosures. The traditionally opaque nature of many bank loans has prevented investors and creditors of financial institutions from accurately assessing thei r risk exposures. The \nincreasing complexity of financial instru ments and the wider range of activities \nconducted by banks and other fina ncial institutions have also  complicated disclosures.  \n I believe market participants might benefit most from more detailed disclosures on asset \nquality, either in the form of estimated mark et values, internal cr edit ratings, other credit \nassessments, or assessments of loan loss re serve adequacy. Also, institutions should be \ndisclosing their levels of con centration within particular i ndustries and countries and with \nregard to individual customers. Other step s toward improving information disclosure \nmight include descriptions of a bank's risk management policies and their comprehensiveness, the bank's business obj ectives and oversight of the resulting \nactivities, and the implications of internal risk models and management's confidence in \nsuch information.  While financial disclosure has a long way to go, many institutions are now making notable progress in reaching out  to investors and other mark et participants and providing \nthem with greater information. It is certainly true that, with the spread of public safety \nnets, increased disclosure may not be of subs tantial benefit to many depositors and others \nlikely to be protected in financial rescues. Ho wever, I think better information will still be \nof significant importance to bank investor s in helping them achieve appropriate \nrisk/return tradeoffs.  \n \nBesides improved disclosure, there are a number of other proposals th at show promise in \nincreasing market discipline. These include subordinated debt and various proposals to \nreform deposit insurance through coinsurance, private insurance, or changes in insurance \ncoverage. These proposals could help shift more responsibility to  bank creditors for \nmonitoring and controlling risk, thus increasing overall market discipline.  \n At the same time, though, I think we must reali ze that there will be some limitations with \nthese approaches in a \"too big to fail\" envi ronment. For instance, policymakers could be \nforced to back away from such policies wh en the outcomes are viewed as too harsh for \nthe economy to tolerate. Also, if creditors and their banks believe that they are likely to \nreceive protection in a crisis, much of the an ticipated market discipline could be left \nunrealized. Thus, while these proposals have merit, we should be cautious in expecting \nthem to forestall serious banking problems.  How Can We Adapt Supervision and Regulation to the New Realities?  While increased market discipline is important , supervision and regul ation must also be \nrebalanced in light of the new realties of the financial system. In the past, rules and \nregulations were of major importance in establishing the guidelines under which \n\n6 institutions operated. These rest rictions addressed the assets, liabilities, and activities that \nwere permissible for particular institutions; in terest rates that coul d be paid on deposits; \nwhere and how institutions could expand; and many other operating constraints. In recent \nyears, many of these rules and regulations were  relaxed or eliminated as they were found \nto limit the services that institutions could offer customers and to hinder firms in adapting to a changing marketplace. As a result, ba nks and other financia l institutions now find \nthemselves competing directly in a much  broader and less structured marketplace. \n For financial supervision and re gulation, I see severa l important implications arising from \nthis changing financial environment. First, with depository institutions competing with less regulated firms and on a worldwide basis,  regulators will no longer be able to limit \nrisk taking through highly re strictive and, in some inst ances, burdensome regulations. \nToo many restrictions would place regulated institutions at a serious competitive \ndisadvantage, which could threaten their continued viability. Se cond, supervisors will \nhave to be concerned about a much wider range of risks. In fact, many institutions are not only expanding into new activities, but are al so increasing their li nkages and exposure to \nother institutions. A third consideration is th at markets have become larger and more \nliquid, and institutions can now change their risk profile, both on and off balance sheet, \nmuch more quickly than before.  What can financial supervisors do as they attempt to adapt to this new environment? One step, which we have already begun, is to use a risk-focused approach  to supervision and \nregulation. Through risk-focused examination procedures, examiners are now directing \nmore attention to the major risks within an institution and to the institution's ability to \nmeasure and control its own risk exposure. For larger institutions, bank internal risk \nmodels, credit rating systems, and risk-man agement practices are becoming important \naspects of this process. On the regulatory si de, proposals to reform risk-based capital are \naimed at providing more refined measures of risk and therefore may help relate a bank's \ncapital needs more closely to its risk profile . A number of other re gulatory changes would \nprovide well-capitalized and well-managed banks more lat itude in their operations. \n The move toward risk-focused supervision a nd regulation is still in its infancy, and I \nbelieve it should be regarded as a promisi ng, rather than a proven, approach. Measuring \nand managing risk remain extremely difficult ta sks, and the results are highly sensitive to \nthe underlying assumptions and a variety of othe r factors. Also, risk -focused supervision \nand risk modeling will require a greater level of expertise, both at the bank and the \nsupervisory level.  Another step that must be taken is to limit concentrations and linka ges among institutions \nthat could lead to systemic problems. To the extent we can reduce interbank exposures \nand prevent serious problems from spreading from one institution to another, we will be \nbetter able to isolate financial problems a nd prevent a systemic crisis. Moreover, by \nisolating and reducing the consequences of one institution's problems, I am hopeful that \nwe can create more room for market disciplin e to work. In recent years, we have made \nsubstantial progress in reducing the vulnerability  of the payments system to the failures \nof individual institutions . We have also taken steps to limit interbank deposit and credit \n\n7 exposures. There is no question, however, that further progress must be made, \nparticularly as institutions continue to become larger and more of a systemic threat and as \nfinancial linkages expand on a worldwide basis.  I believe we must also try to limit the financial activities that are to be protected by the safety net and by \"too big to fail\" policies. I should make clear this  does not mean unduly \nrestricting the financia l activities that any one organiza tion can conduct. Instead, holding \ncompany or financial service company subsidiari es could be used to divide activities into \nthose that receive safety net protection and those that can be  regulated more appropriately \nthrough market discipline. If we could adequately separate  banking and nonbanking \nactivities, we would greatly reduce the imp lications nonbanking activities might have for \nthe safety net and financial stability. Anothe r major benefit is that the market could \ncontinue to be the principal force regulati ng securities, insurance, and nonbank lending \nactivities, subject to the usual customer protection requirements regarding disclosure, \nprevention of fraudulent pract ices, and maintenance of insurance policy reserves. \nAlthough it may be difficult to fully isolate ac tivities in financial organizations, I view \nthis option as giving us the best opportunity to expand market disc ipline and to foster \nefficient and innovative markets.  One other step I strongly recommend is for supervisors to become a greater force in \nensuring that banks accurate ly disclose their condition to the markets. In bank \nexaminations, supervisory personnel collect extensive information on the quality of a \nbank's assets, as well as other indicators of  its condition and risk-management practices. \nWhile supervisors may not want to disclose this information themselves, they are in a \nposition to encourage more accurate disclosu res by banks. For example, examiners could \nascertain whether all uncollectible assets have  been charged off, loan loss reserves are \nreflective of a bank's credit exposure, a nd other aspects of a bank's condition are \naccurately depicted on its balanc e sheet and in its public disclosures. I might even suggest \nthat bank management be required to comment  regarding its assessment of supervisory \nexaminations and to accurately disclose a ny material findings of the examiners. Through \nthis process, examiners could play a leadi ng role in making market discipline a more \neffective tool in controlling risk taking and allocating capital across financial institutions. \n Summary: Coping with Future Financial Crises  Let me conclude my remarks by drawing some  implications from this discussion about \nhow we might approach financial crises in th e future. As I indicated earlier, I believe the \nincrease in financial crises in recent y ears is partly a function of the regulatory \ndisequilibrium that has arisen as policym akers have struggled to adapt to ongoing \nchanges in financial markets and institutions . As we reestablish this equilibrium, the \nnumber of crises should diminish. However, since the new equilibrium will likely place \nmore emphasis on allowing market forces to  guide the development of the financial \nsystem, realistically, we are likely to experien ce somewhat more crises than the historical \nnorm. This is simply the result of allowing ma rkets to play a larger role in the financial \nsystem. In this environment, I believe that it is important that we ask what steps can be \n\n8 taken to minimize the severity of future crises  or, when crises do occur, to improve crisis \nmanagement and resolution procedures.  Some of the changes that I di scussed earlier should help prev ent crises as well as reduce \ntheir severity. For example, improved internal risk cont rol procedures by financial \ninstitutions and better supe rvisory practices may reduce th e likelihood that institutions \nwill get into serious difficulty. Similarly, to the extent that market discipline is effective, \nex ante, in altering the incentives  for institutions to take exce ssive risks, failures, ex post, \nmay be less likely or less severe. And, to  the extent that systemic effects across \ninstitutions can be reduced, crises may be less severe in the future. \n Despite these efforts, however, some crises wi ll occur and so we must also be concerned \nabout how to manage and resolve them with as  low a cost as possibl e. Realistically, this \nis an area in which there is  still considerable disagreem ent both within the academic \ncommunity and among policymakers. One view  is that we need formal resolution \nprocedures such as explicit policies for domes tic and international facilities to provide \nlender-of-last-resort support in times of crisis. Another view is that less explicit \nprocedures and constructive ambiguity are a better approach. The unde rlying issue in this \ndebate is which approach minimizes the moral hazard distortions that accompany explicit or implicit government guarantees.   My own view is that we are better served by explicit and tr ansparent crisis management \nand resolution procedures. It is also important  that these procedures be credible in the \nfinancial markets, which means that we need  to adhere to these procedures even in \nperiods of financial stress. Otherwise, neither market discipline nor regulatory restrictions \nare likely to be effective in controlling ri sk taking, and we may find that resolving the \ncurrent crisis sets the stage for a vicious cy cle of more severe crises in the future."

Historically, financial regulatory policy has been driven by the  \nview that to maintain the health of the financial system you must \n maintain the health of individual institutions.  Accordingly, if  institutions are protected from failure through regulation of \n \ncapital and prudential supervision, the viability of the system  is ensured and the risks to the explicit or implied government  \nsafety nets that protect financial institutions are minimized.  \n Indeed, recent discussions about how to deal with incidents such  as Barings and Daiwa have centered on ways to extend the \n \ntraditional safety and soundness regulation of individual  institutions to incorporate an increased emphasis on risk  \nmanagement policies and procedures. \n      In light of ongoing changes in financial markets, however,  extending the traditional approach to financial market regulation \n \nmay not work.  Extending the traditional approach may be too  costly and difficult, especially for large, globally active  \ninstitutions, because of the complexities of many new activities \n and financial instruments.  Given these difficulties, it seems  appropriate to ask whether there is an alternative regulatory \n \napproach to promoting financial stability and protecting  government safety nets without sacrificing efficiency or stifling  innovation. \n \n     My comments today are designed to provide some thoughts on  possible alternatives.  Two changes in emphasis to the regulatory  \nsystem are discussed.  First, instead of regulating to make \n institutions fail-safe, an alternative approach is to strengthen \n\n3  \nthe stability of the financial system by designing procedures  \nthat prevent large interbank exposures in the payments system and \n interbank deposits.  Second, although moral hazard problems can  be contained through traditional regulatory approaches, an \n \nalternative is to require those institutions that engage in an  expanding array of complex activities to give up direct access to  \ngovernment safety nets in return for reduced regulation and \n oversight.  By further emphasizing these elements within the  regulatory system over expanded micromanagement, individual \n \ninstitutions could be permitted to engage in new activities and  sometimes to fail because financial stability would be less  \nthreatened by the failure of an individual bank--large or small, \n global or domestic.  At the same time, the cost of protecting the  safety nets would be better confined because traditional \n \nregulation would focus on traditional banks that choose to have  access to the safety nets.    \n \n                  THE CHANGING FINANCIAL SYSTEM       In recent years, financial markets around the world have \n \nexperienced significant structural changes.  Some of the more  important changes are the growing importance of capital markets  \nin credit intermediation, the emergence of markets for \n intermediating risks, changes in the activities and risk profiles  of financial institutions, and the increasingly global nature of  \nfinancial intermediation.  These changes have been spurred \n largely by a technological revolution that has reduced the costs  of information gathering, processing, and transmission.  As this \n \ninformation revolution continues, there is little doubt that the  \n\n4 changes in financial markets will also continue. \n      More than ever before, banks face greater competition from \n \nother financial institutions.  Many businesses are turning away  from banks and other depository institutions and directly toward  \ncapital markets and nonbank intermediaries for their funding \n needs.  In the United States, for example, banks have lost market  share in the short-term lending market to commercial paper and \n \nfinance company loans.  Over the past 25 years, bank loans as a  share of short-term debt on the books of nonfinancial  \ncorporations have fallen from about 80 percent to about 50 \n percent.  In addition, corporations have greater access to other  sources of finance, such as medium-term note facilities and junk \n \nbonds.  Similar movements away from banks and toward capital  markets have occurred in Europe, although the movement started  \nlater and has not been as large as in the United States.  As \n these changes occur, financial activities are increasingly taking  place outside of the traditional bank regulatory framework. \n \n     Another change is that intermediation has expanded in scope  from credit intermediation to risk intermediation.  In  \nparticular, growth in the markets for both off- and on-balance \n sheet derivatives has skyrocketed.  These markets allow banks to  intermediate risk by unbundling the total risk of an asset into \n \nits component parts and then transferring combinations of those  components to those who are most willing and able to bear the  risks.  As a result, both financial institutions and nonfinancial \n \ncorporations are more able to actively manage the risk  characteristics of their portfolios.  \n     The increased competition in traditional lines of business \n along with the opportunities in capital and derivatives markets \n\n5  \nhave led the largest domestic and global banks to significantly  \nalter their activities and products.  Among the most significant \n of the new activities are trading and market-making in money  markets, capital markets, foreign exchange, and derivatives.  \n \n     The rise in proprietary trading, market-making, and active  portfolio management has also dramatically altered the risk  \nprofiles of financial institutions.  If used properly for \n portfolio management, new financial instruments can certainly  reduce an institution's risk exposure and raise its profitability \n \nand viability in the financial marketplace.  If used improperly,  however, they expose the institution to sudden, extraordinary  \nlosses, raising the likelihood of failure.  Moreover, the risks \n and opportunities for failure are often exacerbated by the  leverage associated with the new activities and the larger \n \nnumbers of players and greater degree of anonymity in financial  markets.  Increased trading activity, for example, has  \nsignificantly increased the exposure of banks to market risk--the \n risk of loss due to changes in asset prices and the volatility of  asset prices.  Like traditional credit risk, market risk can lead \n \nto significant losses and ultimately to failure if not managed  appropriately.  In contrast to credit-related losses, which can  \ntake time to develop, losses due to market risk can occur \n quickly.  The Barings failure is a prime example of how quickly a  large exposure to market risk can cause an institution to fail--  \nthe bulk of its net losses occurred over a two-week period, with \n one-fourth of the losses occurring in a single day.       A final structural change is that financial intermediation \n \nhas become more global, sweeping aside regional and national  \n\n6 borders.  In banking, for example, the share of U.S. business \n loans made by foreign banks rose from about 20 percent in the \n \nearly 1980s to about 50 percent in the early 1990s.  On the other  hand, non-U.S. corporations are increasingly turning to U.S.  \nfinancial firms for their credit needs and financial advice.  For \n example, seven of the top ten merger advisers world-wide are  American financial institutions, and each of the top four global \n \nunderwriters over the past three years have been American firms.               CAN THE TRADITIONAL REGULATORY APPROACH  \n                  KEEP PACE WITH THE CHANGES?  \n                                      Understandably, regulators have adapted to the ongoing  financial market changes by extending traditional safety and \n \nsoundness regulatory practices--capital requirements for  intermediaries have been raised and adjusted to incorporate new  \nrisks, and the emphasis of prudential supervision on risk \n management has been significantly increased.  In light of the  changes in financial markets, however, simply extending the \n \ntraditional regulatory approach to achieve the goals of financial  regulation may be too difficult and costly.  But before looking  \nat some of the problems with extending traditional regulation, I \n think we must first take a closer look at the objectives of  financial regulation. \n \n The goals of financial regulation ---------------------------------       Most people would agree that the principal goal of financial \n \nregulation is to promote financial market stability.  In an  operational sense, this means that financial market disruptions  \nshould not have a significant impact on aggregate real economic \n activity.  This definition suggests that the failure of an \n\n7  \nindividual financial institution, even a large institution,  \nshould not be a concern unless it is allowed to propagate or \n become systemic.  By itself, the failure of a single, large  institution is unlikely to have a great effect on aggregate \n \noutput because the total assets of even the largest financial  firms account for only a small share of aggregate output.  When  \nDrexel, Burnham, Lambert failed in 1990, for example, there was \n no noticeable or lasting effect on economic activity.  As we know  from the banking panics of the late 1800s and early 1900s, \n \nhowever, failures that propagate through the financial system can  have disastrous consequences for the real economy.  \n     The primary ingredients that make it possible for problems \n at a few institutions to spread to many are the use of extensive  leverage by these institutions and their direct ties to the \n \npayment system.  For example, the failure of a single bank could  spread to other banks that have large credit exposures to the  \nfailing bank through clearinghouses and correspondent deposits.  \n The failure of these banks, in turn, could spread to other  institutions in a similar manner. \n \n     As it turns out, actual losses are rarely large enough to  turn the financial problems of only a few institutions into a  \nsystem-wide financial panic.  Nevertheless, the mere possibility \n that losses can spread, combined with customer uncertainty about  the condition of their banks, can cause depositors and other  \ncreditors to lose confidence and run on their banks--both problem \n and healthy banks alike.  In a fractional reserve banking system,  bank customers know their deposits are not backed by liquid \n \nassets.  As a result, if customers are uncertain about the  \n\n8 condition of their banks and their funds are not guaranteed, the \n only certain way they can get all of their money is to be one of \n \nthe first to withdraw funds before the bank fails.  And when a  large fraction of  a bank's depositors or creditors behave this  \nway, even solvent banks can fail. \n      In the United States, the problem of bank runs was solved by  the creation of deposit insurance.  Other countries also have \n \nexplicit or implied government guarantees backing their financial  institutions.  With such guarantees, depositors and creditors  \nhave no reason to run when problems occur at banks other than \n their own.  Indeed, they have no reason to run even if they think  their own bank might fail. \n \n     Such guarantees and the associated loss of market discipline  as an effective check on institutional excesses, however, lead to  \nanother problem--namely, the moral hazard that institutions will \n take excessive risks.  While preventing runs on solvent  institutions is desirable, preventing runs on insolvent \n \ninstitutions is not.  The threat of failure keeps a bank honest  and inhibits it and the industry from trending toward excessive  \nrisks.  Without this market discipline provided by creditors \n willing to withdraw their funds when they suspect a bank of being  unsafe, banks have an incentive to take excessive risks.  While \n \nthese risks are borne by the banks, they are also partly borne by  taxpayers and others who fund the financial safety nets.  In the  United States, for example, the risks are borne by the healthy \n \nbanks who fund the deposit insurance system, by their customers  who pay the costs through higher loan rates and lower deposit  \nrates, and ultimately, as we learned from the U.S. savings and \n loan crisis of the 1980s, by taxpayers. \n\n9  \n     The moral hazard caused by deposit insurance creates a  \nsecond reason for financial regulation.  Since insured depositors \n no longer have an incentive to monitor and discipline banks,  someone else must take over the responsibility of preventing \n \nbanks from imposing the costs of excessive risk taking on the  safety nets.  This responsibility has naturally fallen to those  \nagencies who are already regulating banks. \n  Problems in extending the traditional regulatory approach --------------------------------------------------------- \n \n     The traditional approach to maintaining financial stability  and to protecting government safety nets is safety and soundness  \nregulation.  While safety and soundness regulation has evolved \n through the years, the premise that underlies this approach is  that the best way to maintain the health of the financial system \n \nis to maintain the health of individual institutions.  According  to this view, if institutions are protected from failure through  \nregulation of capital and prudential supervision, the health of \n the system is ensured and potential risks to the safety nets are  minimized. \n \n     The regulatory changes of the past decade have largely been  within the context of this traditional approach.  The raising of  \ncapital requirements and the incorporation of risk into capital \n requirements in accordance with the 1988 Basle Accord on capital  standards is just one example of how the traditional approach to  \nregulation has been extended.  In addition, in the United States, \n laws such as the FDIC Improvement Act were passed in response to  the S&L crisis and the bank failures of the 1980s and early 1990s \n \nto reduce the likelihood of future failures.    \n\n10      More recently, discussion in the United States and abroad \n has turned its attention to how regulation should respond to the \n \nongoing changes in financial markets and to the Barings and Daiwa  incidents.  The discussion has focused on extending the  \ntraditional regulatory system by substantially increasing the \n degree of oversight of a bank's risk management and internal  operations, especially for large, globally active institutions.  \n \nIn the United States, for example, the Federal Reserve and the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have both started  \n\"supervision by risk\" programs that increase the focus of bank \n examinations on risk management processes.       Extending traditional regulation is difficult and costly.  \n \n     --------------------------------------------------------  Given the extent of the ongoing changes in financial markets, an  \nextension of traditional safety and soundness regulation may not \n be effective.  The biggest problem with extending safety and  soundness regulation is that it is costly and difficult to \n \nimplement for those institutions that are engaging in more active  portfolio management and extensive trading and market-making  \nactivities.  One reason it is so difficult is that many of the \n new activities and financial instruments and the associated risks  and risk management practices are extremely complex.  As a \n \nresult, examiners need to develop the expertise to understand and  keep pace with the continuing evolution of asset valuation models  and risk management techniques and processes.  This difficulty is \n \nnot meant as a criticism of the capabilities of bank examiners;  rather, the point is that the private sector has significantly  \nmore resources--both human and financial--than the regulators for \n keeping pace with the changes in financial markets.  \n\n11  \n     For example, consider the Basle Committee's recent revision  \nto the capital adequacy standards to incorporate market risk.  \n The Committee's capital standards allow banks to use their own  value-at-risk models to determine the amount of capital necessary \n \nto protect themselves from market risk.  Clearly, banks need to  use their own models to effectively manage risk.  To effectively  \nsupervise banks that use their own models, however, examiners \n need to have the expertise to judge the adequacy of the models  and the risk management practices.  At a minimum, this requires \n \nunderstanding the quantitative aspects of the model, such as its   statistical structure, its accuracy in valuing assets, and the \n \nadequacy of the stress tests used to determine the financial  consequences of large movements in interest rates and asset  \nprices.  In addition, examiners must understand the qualitative \n aspects of a risk management strategy, such as how management  uses the model's information and ensures compliance with its risk \n \nmanagement strategy.  Indeed, the Barings and Daiwa episodes are  prime examples of the importance of these qualitative aspects.   \nThe lack of internal controls that monitor compliance with \n management's risk strategy is the reason that these institutions'  exposure to market risk was able to rise to extreme levels.  \n \nOverall, then, examiners have to know as much about a bank, its  model, and control procedures as the rocket scientists who built  the model and the management team who designed the risk \n \nmanagement strategy.       The complexity of the new activities and instruments also  \nmakes traditional safety and soundness regulation more difficult \n by making traditional capital regulation less meaningful.  \n\n12  \nCapital is harder to measure because it is increasingly difficult  \nto assess the value of many of the new assets that are not \n regularly traded, such as over-the-counter derivatives and  structured notes.  Moreover, balance sheet information that is \n \nreported at, say, quarterly intervals is less useful because it  is only a snapshot of a portfolio whose value can change  \ndramatically within a day.  Also, the pure lack of information \n about many off-balance sheet activities makes it more difficult  to assess capital adequacy. \n \n     The complexity of the new activities is not the only reason  it is more difficult to extend traditional regulation--another  \nreason is the erasure of national borders.  With the \n globalization of finance, uncertainty about regulatory  responsibility and the difficulty of coordinating regulatory \n \npolicies across international agencies have made it easier for  problems to go undetected or undisciplined.  In the United  \nStates, for example, steps were taken after the BCCI failure to \n prevent global institutions from slipping through the regulatory  cracks.  The recent Daiwa incident, however, indicates the \n \ndifficulty of solving these problems.         Finally, extending traditional regulation is more difficult  \nand costly due to the growth of financial activity taking place \n outside of the banking industry and the traditional bank  regulatory system.  At a minimum, the growth of activities  \noutside of banking requires bank regulators to coordinate their \n policies with the regulators of other types of financial  institutions, such as securities and insurance firms.  In \n \naddition, to the extent nonbank activity exposes the financial  \n\n13 system to systemic risks, extending the traditional regulatory \n approach might require extending safety and soundness regulation \n \nto other types of financial institutions.  This is not only  economically costly, but is also probably politically infeasible.  \n     Extending traditional regulation could reduce financial \n     -------------------------------------------------------  efficiency.  A second problem with extending the traditional ----------- \n \napproach to regulation is that to the extent it makes regulation  more intrusive, the efficiency of the financial system is  \nreduced.  More intrusive regulation can substantially increase \n compliance costs.  In the United States, for example, the FDIC  Improvement Act included certain micromanagement provisions that \n \nwere costly to implement and monitor.        Efficiency is also reduced because regulatory restrictions,  \nby their nature, slow innovation and spawn attempts to avoid the \n restrictions.  In the United States, the banking industry has  devoted significant resources to avoiding and lobbying against \n \nlaws that prevent it from expanding geographically and from  engaging in other financial activities, such as securities  \nunderwriting and insurance sales. \n      Extending traditional regulation might not ensure financial      -----------------------------------------------------------  \nstability.  Finally, history is replete with examples of \n----------   regulation that have led to less, rather than more, stability in  \nan industry--both financial and nonfinancial.  One reason \n stability may decline is that regulation often limits the ability  of institutions to adapt to changing market conditions.  The U.S. \n \nsavings and loan crisis in the 1980s is a prime example of how  \n\n14 the inability to adapt can wreak havoc on an industry. \n  \n        ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL REGULATION \n      In light of the problems with simply extending safety and  soundness regulation, it is natural to ask whether there is an \n \nalternative to the traditional approach.  Specifically, is it  possible to promote financial stability and protect the safety  \nnets from moral hazard problems in a cost effective way that does \n not sacrifice efficiency, stifle innovation, or create  alternative sources of instability?  While I make no pretense \n \nthat we should abandon all aspects of traditional forms of  regulation, I would like to outline two changes that should  \nreceive greater emphasis in lieu of expanding our current system.  \n The first change would promote financial stability by expanding  efforts at reducing large interbank credit exposures in the \n \npayments system and interbank deposits.  The second change would  protect government safety nets by requiring those institutions  \nthat engage in complex activities to give up direct access to the \n safety nets.  In return, these institutions would receive reduced  regulation and regulatory oversight.  The primary advantages of \n \nthese features are that financial stability would be threatened  less by an individual bank--large or small, global or domestic--  \nwhile the cost of protecting the safety nets would be limited by \n focusing traditional regulation on traditional banks that choose  to have access to the safety nets.  \n \nHow could regulation be changed? --------------------------------       The first step in building an alternative regulatory \n \napproach is to go back to the beginning and rethink why we are  \n\n15 regulating the financial system.  As was discussed earlier, a key \n to ensuring financial stability is to prevent the failure of an \n \nindividual institution from spreading through the payments system  to an economy-wide financial crisis.  The current approach to  \nprotecting the financial system from the propagation of financial \n disturbances is to try to prevent problems from occurring at  individual institutions in the first place by regulating the \n \nactivities of banks and other financial institutions.       An alternative solution is to set up mechanisms that prevent  \nproblems that do occur from spreading to other institutions.   \n Specifically, measures such as collateral requirements, debit  caps, and pricing of intraday credit can be used to prevent large \n \ninterbank credit exposures in the payments system.  In addition,  limits on interbank deposit exposures and on loans to a single  \nborrower can further protect the economy from problems at both \n bank and nonbank financial institutions.  By limiting interbank  exposures, problems at a particular institution cannot threaten \n \nthe viability of any other institution.  As a result, any  institution--big or small--could fail without threatening  \nfinancial stability. \n      In the United States, we have made some progress in reducing  the vulnerability of the payments system to the failures of \n \nindividual financial institutions.  On large-dollar payments  systems, such as Fedwire (the Federal Reserve's electronic funds  transfer system) and the Clearing House Interbank Payment System \n \n(CHIPS), the payments system is protected by a combination of  fees on daylight overdrafts, collateral requirements for  \ninstitutions using the payments systems, well-defined loss \n allocation formulas to ensure settlement in cases of default, and \n\n16  \noverdraft and net debit caps.  In addition, the FDIC Improvement  \nAct set caps on some interbank deposits.  Specifically, banks \n that have deposits at correspondents who are classified as less  than adequately capitalized must limit their interday credit \n \nexposure to no more than 25 percent of their capital.  Further  progress needs to be made in this area, particularly in the  \nsettlement of foreign exchange and other international \n transactions where nonsynchronous operating hours and other  institutional features continue to expose banks and other firms \n \nto considerable risks.       Even if large interbank exposures are limited, however,  \nsafety and soundness regulation is needed to protect government \n safety nets from the moral hazard problems at institutions  protected by the safety nets.  In light of the costs and \n \ndifficulties of implementing prudential supervision for larger  institutions who are increasingly involved in new activities and  \nindustries, the time may have come to sever the link between \n these institutions and the safety nets, making it feasible to  significantly scale back regulatory oversight of their \n \noperations.  This could be accomplished by not allowing these  institutions to offer deposits backed by government guarantees.   \nSuch institutions could still offer safe deposits, but they would \n have to be guaranteed in other ways, such as by collateralizing  the deposits or by offering the deposits through insulated  \nsubsidiaries that only engage in relatively safe activities.  In \n addition, access to central bank discount window loans would be  minimized so that these institutions would not have the option of \n \nasking the central bank for a loan if they got into trouble.   \n\n17 Because these institutions would not have direct access to \n government safety nets and would not expose other banks to risks \n \nthrough the payments system, it would not be necessary to subject  these institutions to extensive regulation.   \n     It is important to emphasize that the lack of direct access \n to the safety nets would only apply to those institutions that  are involved in new and more complex activities and not to the \n \nvast majority of institutions that continue to engage in  traditional lending and investment activities.  These  \n\"traditional\" institutions would continue to operate and be \n regulated much as they are today.   \nWhat are the merits of the proposed changes? \n--------------------------------------------       In light of the recent changes in financial markets and the  \nlikelihood that the markets will continue to evolve, the \n regulatory changes discussed above have several advantages over a  policy of simply extending traditional safety and soundness \n \nregulation.        First, by preventing large interbank exposures, financial \n \n     stability would not be threatened by any individual bank--       large or small, global or domestic.         \n \n     Second, by limiting access to government safety nets to       those institutions who engage in traditional activities, the       safety nets would be less exposed to the moral hazard \n \n     problems.  Moreover, this approach is feasible and not too       costly or difficult to implement.  Specifically, since banks  \n     involved in complex activities that are difficult and costly \n      to regulate would pose a reduced threat to the safety nets, \n\n18  \n     they would be subject to less regulation.  Institutions that  \n     choose to retain direct access to the safety nets, however, \n      would continue to be regulated as they are now.   \n     Third, it follows from the first two advantages that there \n      is much less of a rationale for a policy that makes some       banks \"too big too fail.\"  Under the current regulatory \n \n     system, regulators are unlikely to allow large, globally       active banks to fail because of the potential systemic  \n     problems and the threat to government safety nets.  With the \n      changes in the regulatory emphasis that I am proposing,       however, the financial system and safety nets would be \n \n     better insulated from large failures.    \n     Finally, since traditional regulation would not be extended \n      for those institutions involved in new activities, the       changes described above would not produce some of the other \n \n     problems associated with extending the traditional       regulatory system.  For example, banks involved in  \n     nontraditional activities would not face an increase in \n      compliance costs and would have no need to devote resources       to avoiding new regulations.  In addition, the changes would \n \n     allow banks to adapt to changes in the financial and       economic environment.  As a result, the proposed changes       would not stifle innovation or reduce the efficiency of the \n \n     financial system.    \n                      CONCLUDING COMMENTS \n      I would like to conclude by placing my thoughts on financial \n\n19  \nregulation in a somewhat broader context.  The premise of my  \nremarks is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for \n financial regulation to keep up with the complexity of the  changes in financial markets.  Specifically, it is becoming too \n \ncostly and difficult to effectively monitor the activities of  large, globally active institutions that are involved in  \nnontraditional financial activities.  Simply extending \n traditional methods of regulation to cope with these changes may  not be the best way to promote a stable and efficient financial \n \nsystem.       The alternative, however, is not to throw up our hands, turn  \naway from regulation, and rely exclusively on market discipline \n to create a better financial system.  Market discipline by itself  cannot solve all of the systemic problems or moral hazard issues.  \n \nWhat I am suggesting is for us to focus on the issue of systemic  risk by placing an emphasis on efforts to strengthen the ability  \nof the financial system to cope with the failure of individual \n institutions.  In addition, while moral hazard problems can be  dealt with by traditional regulation, an alternative is to lessen \n \naccess to government safety nets for those institutions that  pursue complex, nontraditional activities.  It is important to  \nrealize that such an approach does not require a radical change \n in regulatory practices, merely the recognition that institutions  that engage in different activities may need to be regulated  \ndifferently.  Indeed, the majority of depository institutions \n would continue to have access to government safety nets and would  continue to operate and be regulated as they are today. \n \n      Although the approach I am suggesting should result in a \n\n20  \nmore stable and efficient financial system in the long run, it  \nwould not eliminate the possibility of macroeconomic disruptions \n causing financial crises that may affect the health of a large  number of financial institutions.  As a result, central banks \n \nwill continue to have an important role in promoting stability of  the economy and in providing liquidity to the financial system in  \ntimes of crisis.  Thus, it is crucial that central banks pursue \n macroeconomic policies that preserve economic and financial  stability.  In addition, if a large macroeconomic or financial \n \nshock to the economy should occur, central banks must be able to  respond quickly by providing the liquidity necessary to maintain  \nthe smooth functioning of the financial system."
