Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n    \n \n       \nMid-America Payments Conference 2009 \nKansas City, Missouri \nOctober 29, 2009 \n \n    \nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect t hose of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or re presentatives. \n\n \n \n2 \n Introduction \nI am pleased to have an opportunity to join  you today at the conclu sion of this year’s \nMid-America Payments Conference.  We have had a long association with the Kansas City \nClearinghouse, MPX and now EPCOR, as we shar e a focus on improving our nation’s payments \nsystem and ensuring its benefits accrue to financ ial institutions and their customers here in the \nheartland.    \nAs I begin my remarks today, I want to em phasize that I am expressing my own views, \nand they are not those of the Federal Reserve System. \nAs you know, our payments system is going through one of the most radical \ntransformations since the advent of the ACH network more than four decades ago.  The result is \nnot only a payments system that is much more  complex in its operation, but also in the \nchallenges that it faces and th e risks to its integrity.   \nIn response to this evolution, central banks around the world are th inking about how they \ncan continue to maintain an efficient, safe, a nd accessible payments system. In the United States, \none key question going forward is what role the Federal Reserve can and should play in this new \nenvironment. While some in the industry and government advocate a reduced presence, I believe \nthere is a strong case for the Federal Reserv e Banks to continue active involvement. \n \nChanges Prompting Rethinki ng of the Fed’s Role \nSince their founding almost a century ago, the Federal Reserve Banks have played a role \nin the nation’s payments system. Charged with ensu ring its efficiency, safety  and accessibility to \nthe public, this mission remains as important as ever.  \n\n \n \n3 \n The payments system today is very different than the one that was in place in the early \n1900s.  But more striking is how far removed it is from what we saw only a few years ago. \nConsumers have embraced debit and credit card s as the preferred form for payments. Paper \nchecks, when written, are converted to electr onic form and cleared via ACH or Check 21 \nnetworks.  Today, paper checks represent only 2 percent of the total deposited with Federal \nReserve Banks. By the end of the year, the Fede ral Reserve will have clos ed all but one of its \npaper check handling sites. The Federal Reserve he lped drive this move to electronics and the \npublic benefits are clear. For example, the aggreg ate fees paid by financial institutions to the \nFederal Reserve Banks for check collection will  have declined from about $700 million in 2005 \nto less than half that amount by next year.   \nWhile check clearing volume has been declin ing for a decade, ACH transaction growth \nbegan to flatten about a year a go. Whether that represents the te mporary effects of the recession \nor is the result of a structural change, the past rapid growth rates that we  have seen in our ACH \ntransactions are unlikely to continue at such a pace.  \nMeanwhile, debit card transactions have cont inued to increase, even during the recession. \nWe have also seen the growing presence and influence of nonbank providers of payments services. For example, firms like PayPal and Am azon are introducing the capability for software \ndevelopers to apply their front-end payment so lution to make online purchases for specific \nmerchants wanting to control the buying experience. Mobile access to  the Internet is projected to \nexpand rapidly with implications for the positioni ng of financial institutions, telecom networks, \nand technology firms in the payments chain. \nAs we step back and take a broad look at th ese developments in retail payments, it is \nperhaps striking how much of th e growth is taking place in the private sector with little \n\n \n \n4 \n regulatory oversight.  The Federal Reserve and ot her central banks have not played as active a \nrole in the operation or oversight of card ne tworks, the fastest growing portion of retail \npayments.  Many nonbank providers of payments products and services have little, if any, \noversight of their operations. If this continues,  it will create a significan t vulnerability for our \npayments system. \nFor many in the industry, the success and pr ofitability of payments providers is a \ntestament to the superiority of market solutio ns outside the Federal Reserve or regulatory \nenvironment. “Why mess with success?” I am as ked. While in the short term this may seem \nobvious, I want to remind you that this was also  said about subprime lending, complex financial \nproducts and commercial real estate guidelines only  a few years ago. It is the nature of highly \nprofitable private providers to oppose regulation and increased competition. However, in today’s \nenvironment, and based on recent experience, it s eems clear that the central bank will be held \naccountable for the safety and accessibility of a reliable payments system. If consumers are \novercharged or disadvantaged, or if the system  comes crashing down everyone will ask, “Where \nwas the central bank?  Why di dn’t it protect the public and the financial system?”   \nSo yes, candidly, I do question whether the private sector alone can provide a safe, \ncompetitive and efficient payments system over the long term. \n \nEconomic Rationale for a Govern ment Role in Retail Payments \nIn general, most economists believe that ma rkets work well in most circumstances. The \nexceptions arise when there are externalities or other forms of market failure. Examples are when there are interdependencies among market participants  that lead to important spillover effects or \n\n \n \n5 \n when scale economies lead to the emergence of  a small number of industry providers with \npotential market power.   \nMany payments markets have a number of thes e features, and I would like to highlight \nthree that seem especially important in assessi ng the need for central ba nk involvement in retail \npayments.  First, payments markets are networ ks, and economic studies of networks suggest \nthere can be severe coordination problems that may inhibit their growth and development. These \ninvolve difficulties in cr eating standards and in undertaking la rge startup capital expenditures.   \nSecond, because of externalities and spillove r effects, networks may under invest in \nsecurity as individual pa rticipants look first to their own prof itability and do not consider system \nintegrity as a whole. We are all well aware of the recent rise in  major information breaches and \nidentity theft in the retail payments system. I wo uld note that many of thes e instances have been \ncentered at nonbank payments providers.   \nThird, because of scale economies, payments systems and electronic payments systems in \nparticular, tend to have a small number of provi ders, raising concerns about market power and \nnoncompetitive pricing. In the United States, we have seen a trend toward increased \nconcentration in debit card networks, with a decline from 43 debit networks in 1995 to 13 in \n2007. Indeed in 2007, the top three debit card netw orks (PIN and signature) handled 88 percent \nof total transactions and Visa alone had a market  share of almost 64 percent. As consolidation \nhas occurred, we have seen significant increases in interchange fees, a development that has not \ngone unnoticed by the public and govern ment officials around the world. \nIn light of these issues, I think a strong case can be made for continued central bank \ninvolvement in retail payments. The key questio ns at hand focus on the nature of central bank \n\n \n \n6 \n activities and, especially, how these activities shoul d evolve to meet the changing structure of the \nretail payments industry. \nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s involve ment in retail payments has centered on \novercoming coordination problems th at have inhibited efficiency. In this regard, I believe the \nFederal Reserve's position as an operator has allowed it to be an effective catalyst and facilitator for payments modernization.  \nFor example, in the early 1970s, as bankers, re gional payments associations, and the U.S. \nTreasury struggled with the incr easing volume of check payments and related costs, the Federal \nReserve collaborated with the industry to build the automated processing systems and \ndistribution network that would become the AC H.  And, in 1984, the Federal Reserve provided \nthe impetus for industry adoption of another ma jor innovation by applying digital image capture \ntechnology to the backroom of th e check processing business, agai n in response to a need from \nthe U.S. Treasury to reduce the costs of mi crofilming checks it issued.  As you know, this \ninvestment was later leveraged to esta blish check image exchange networks. \nIn each of these endeavors and others, we have worked closely with the industry and \nCongress to develop legislation, standards, technology and proce dures to overcome the severe \ncoordination difficulties that prevented the private sector from moving ahead on its own.  Even today, we continue to leverage our operational role in ACH. For example, we’re working with \nindustry stakeholders to address problems such as how to more efficiently and safely exchange \npayments internationally with lo w volumes now, but growing volumes in the future.  And we are \nworking to introduce faster ACH clearing with  a same day settlement capability, which we \nexpect to roll out in the first half of next year. \n\n \n \n7 \n Finally, I would be remiss if I did not empha size that in times of crisis, the Federal \nReserve’s operator role has served to minimize the impact to public confidence that would occur \nwith major disruptions to the re tail payments system. In the hours and days following the Sept. \n11, 2001 attacks, the Federal Reserve Banks were  in a position to keep the check collection \nsystem operating despite the disruption to air tran sportation. While the proba bility of disruptions \nis low, crises will happen sometime in the future and I believe the Federal Reserve’s operator role enhances the resiliency of our retail payments system. \nIn the future, the Fed’s traditional role of  catalyst and facilitator may be less needed \noutside of ACH. After all, card networks have developed and prospered without Federal Reserve \ninvolvement, and the innovation introduced  by nonbank payments providers has been \nimpressive.   \n \nThoughts on the Federal Reserve Bank s' Future Role in Retail Payments  \nIn my view, a starting point for considering the Federal Reserve's future role is to \nconsider whether the safety and efficiency of retail payments will be enhanced by the central bank’s continuing presence.   \nAs I indicated earlier, it is not  clear to me that the privat e sector will make sufficient \ninvestments to maintain the safety and integrity of  retail payments without some sort of Federal \nReserve or government pressure. Consequently, I believe it is important to ask whether the \nFederal Reserve, as a traditional, trusted provider of secure payments services, can play a role in \nhelping to enhance the security of the retail pa yments system and reducing identity theft. More \nbroadly, I think it is important to consider th e extent to which nonbank providers of payments \n\n \n \n8 \n services pose systemic risks to the retail paymen ts system and to explore how they, along with \ntraditional providers, might be more effectivel y monitored by regulatory oversight programs. \nI also think that the Federal Reserve coul d play a role in enhancing the competitive \nefficiency of the retail payments system by le veraging its operational role  in ACH to provide a \nplatform for clearing all forms of  debit transactions. Note that I am not suggesting the Fed issue \ndebit or credit cards, but rather, that the Federa l Reserve provide a cost effective alternative to \nmoving and clearing debit transactio ns, and as a systemic backup to the private sector – a role it \nhas played in payments since nearly its foundi ng. Such an approach may require additional \ninvestments in and enhancements to the FedA CH network. Some may disagree, but looking \nback, the Federal Reserve’s role in check paym ents did not drive comp etition out, but assured \nbroad, safe access in a more competitive environment, to the payments system.  \nAs I have floated this idea over the past year , I have received feedback from some who \ndisagree. However, we need to think about the ef fects of the likely alte rnatives. As I indicated \nearlier, concern about noncompetitive pricing of payments services and market power have \nemerged around the world. This has led to signifi cant government interventions in market pricing \nand market practices in a grow ing number of countries. The c ourse taken in many of these \ncountries has been to subject the card networks and market partic ipants to greater oversight and, \nin some cases, to direct government involveme nt in interchange pricing. As you know, similar \nbills are pending in Congress. \nMy own view, like that of many economists, is that government involvement in direct \nprice setting in any industry is fraught with problems in implementation, generally leading to \npoor outcomes and unintended consequences. At the same time, noncompetitive market \nstructures and pricing, if present,  do need to be addressed. One alte rnative, of cour se is greater \n\n \n \n9 \n antitrust enforcement. My suggestion is somewhat different, to increase competition via the \nFederal Reserve’s role in retail payments, speci fically as an operator of the ACH network. Of \ncourse there may be other means of making non competitive markets more contestable, which \nalso should be considered. \n \nSummary \nIn summary, the retail payments system is  evolving rapidly and is more complex than \never. It serves as a critical component to the infrastructure of the economy. The Federal Reserve, \nworking closely with financial institutions and the industry as a partner and competitor has been \nan important driver of efficiencies and current le vels of safety and stabili ty. However, the growth \nin payments transactions is now occurring in  card networks, and nonbanks ’ presence is growing. \nSome may call for the Fed to exit retail paymen ts now that physical distribution is no longer \nneeded and its share of retail payments tran sactions is naturally declining. However, \nconcentration in card markets, increased concerns  about security and re liability, the unintended \nconsequences of regulation versus Fed participati on in these markets, and the success of the Fed \nin sparking industry innovation fr om its position on the ground, lead  me to conclude that Fed’s \npresence as an operator is needed now more than ever."

        "content": "Regulatory Reform and the Economy: \nWe Can Do Better \n \n \n      \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n       \nDenver, Colorado \nOctober 6, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n I want to thank you for attending this ev ening’s Economic Forum, hosted by the Denver \nBranch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. When Congress created the Federal Reserve \nin 1913, they believed very strongly that the na tion’s central bank could not be an institution \nisolated inside Washington. Inst ead, they recognized the importan ce of distribu ting the Federal \nReserve’s responsibility broadly across the nation, creating regiona l Federal Reserve Banks that \nserve specific regions of the country. The regi onal Banks and Bank Branches, like the one here \nin Denver, are under the direction of local boards. Our directors pl ay a key role in connecting the \nFederal Reserve and its policy deliberations direc tly to the communities we serve. We have two \nDenver-area directors on the Ka nsas City office’s board, and the seven-member Denver board \nincludes four Denver-area director s. I would like to recognize how  important these Coloradans \nare to the success of our work and thank each of them for their service to our nation’s central \nbank. \n \nCHALLENGES \nIn the past when I have spoken at this program, my comments have focused almost \nentirely on the economic outlook. In that regard, I can tell you that I see nothing that conflicts \nwith the widely held opinion that we are in recovery. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and \nwe are starting to see improvement in busine ss and manufacturing. Addi tionally, yield spreads \nbetween low-risk assets, such as Treasuries, and higher risk assets are na rrowing. They are not at \nprerecession levels, but there is a clear indicat ion that investors are more willing to provide \ncapital, which is extremely important. A vast amount  of stimulus has been put in place to spark \nthis recovery, and I believe it wi ll prevent a double-dip recession.  \nThe stimulus will, however, present its own challenges. The Federal Reserve and other \ncentral banks around the world will have to unw ind the extensive policy accommodation used to \nhalt the economy’s decline. That will be a de licate process because removing too soon could \nreturn the economy to recession while waiting too long will foster an inflationary spiral. The \nprocess will be particularly deli cate for this recovery because it will proceed slowly, hampered \nby a significant debt overhang and uncertainty  around the condition of some of the largest \nfinancial institutions. Thus, the challenge to mone tary policy is to act in such a manner that you \nencourage the recovery while not fo stering conditions for a future cr isis, albeit one of a different \nnature.  \n\n3 \n As policy is discussed and even debated, it is important to note that the current fed funds \nrate is zero. We all know that the neutral rate is not zero. Equally obvi ous to me is that a rate of 1 \nor 2 percent is not tight monetary policy – it is  still very accommodative.  As we consider our \nchoices, I would not support a tight monetary policy in the current environment, but my \nexperience tells me that we will need to remove our very accommodative policy sooner rather than later. Even if we were to start immedi ately, much time would pass before incremental \nincreases could be considered tight or even neutral policy. \nMonetary policy, however, is not the only area where we will have to consider the long-\nterm implications of our actions as we emerge from  this crisis. In that regard, I think the best use \nof my time here this evening will be to explai n why I think the hard decisions are ahead in the \narea of regulatory reform, which is currently unde r consideration in Congress. Looking at some \nof the policy issues that have emerged in recent  weeks, it seems the public debate continues to \ndistract from what I judge was the primary cause of  this crisis. We must address the issue of too \nbig to fail or we will repeat the mistakes of the past, with ever-worsening consequences. I know \nwe can do better. \n \nREGULATORY REFORM \nToo Big to Fail \nReform in the regulation and oversight of our financial system clearly is needed. As sure \nas we know that tomorrow will arrive, we know that  a financial crisis will occur again at some \ntime in the future. Therefore, the most important  exercise that we s hould undertake now is to \nensure that problems at large financial institu tions are not allowed to  jeopardize the basic \nsurvival of our financial system and economy.  \nHow do we do that?  How do we prevent ince ntive compensation schemes that carry high \ncosts to taxpayers? How do we best protect the consumer from unfair and deceptive practices by \nfirms that are currently unregulated or under-re gulated? While the Administration has taken an \nimportant initial step to address these lapses in our financial system, it is focusing first on \nsymptoms rather than the disease.  \nAdam Smith is often thought of as the E nglish-speaking world’s father of modern \neconomics. He is widely known for hi s book titled, The Wealth of Nations\n, in which he provided \n\n4 \n his analogy that a market economy was like an invi sible hand guiding resources  to their best use. \nLess well-known is another passage in  that book in which he warns that: \n \n“The interest of the dealers … is always in some resp ects different from, and even opposite to, that of the \npublic. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is  always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market \nmay frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be \nagainst it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by ra ising their profits above what they naturally would be, to \nlevy … an absurd tax upon … their fellow-citizens. The pr oposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which \ncomes from this order ought always to be listened to w ith great precaution…. It comes from an order of men whose \ninterest is never exactly the same with  that of the public, who have generally  an interest to deceive and even to \noppress the public, and who … upon many o ccasions, both deceived and oppressed it.” \n \nTo get a sense of what Adam Smith is talk ing about, I would point out that in 1999 the \nCongress passed a piece of legisl ation, heavily endorsed by our la rgest banking firms, called the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This le gislation ended the separation of  commercial and investment \nbanking. It broadened the market and allowed for th e accelerated growth of  large financial firms \nin the United States, turning them into institutio ns that were thought to be “too big to fail.”   \nThis should not be dismissed as a populist vi ew of these institutions, but one that is \nsupported by the data. It is best seen by examin ing the advantages that accrued to these firms \nwith respect to their capital levels. The market, knowing these firms were too big to fail, \ntolerated an ever-expanding levera ge ratio, relative to owner equit y. For example, if you look at \nthe 20 largest instituti ons, their equity-to-assets ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was \nabout 4.3 percent. If you look at th e next smaller group of institutions , their equity-to-assets ratio \nwas almost 6.5 percent. The smaller institutions simply must carry lower leverage ratio because \nall those in the market – management, shareholders  and creditors – know they  will lose their jobs \nand investments if they make d ecisions that cause their banks to  fail. This type of market \ndiscipline is less immediate to the owners  and creditors of th e larger firms.  \nIf you were to place these larg est institutions under the same leverage constraints as the \nsmaller firms – at least 6.5 percent equity to asse t – these larger firms would need to raise more \nthan $275 billion in new capital or shrink their assets by more than $4 trillion. This capital \ndifference is an overwhelming advantage to these largest firms and, indeed, has enabled them to \nnarrow the competition to an incredible degree. Si nce the change in law, the largest 20 firms \nhave increased their control of the nation’s banking assets from about 35 percent to an \n\n5 \n astonishing 70 percent. Even more  striking perhaps is the fact th at some of these firms are now \n30 to 40 percent larger than they were when th is crisis began, and as you know, many of these \nfirms were protected during the crisis.  \nWhen the crisis unfolded and these largest fi rms were at risk of failure, Congress passed \nthe $700 billion TARP legislation. It was done to protect the broa d economy, but it also had the \nadditional effect of institutionalizing t oo big to fail in the United States.  \n \nCompensation \nOne of the ironies of this ac tion is that the management of these firms, even those \nneeding TARP funds to survive,  continues to receive enormous  compensation packages. As a \nresult, one of the issues currently distracti ng Congress and the public is executive compensation. \nI certainly understand the anger directed at the well-paid indi viduals atop large firms that \ncontributed to this crisis. However, a comp rehensive plan for resolving these firms and \ndismissing management, rather than protecting them from failure, woul d address compensation \nissues far more effectively because it would leav e these individuals out of  work and wipe out any \nownership stake they hold. That  does much more for accountability than simply capping an \nindividual’s pay. In fact, there is some question if pay caps could even be firmly implemented – \nas you may know some firms have  already begun to work around compensation limits by raising \nbase salaries to million-dollar levels.  \nCompensation restrictions also  call into question the tenants of capitalism in terms of \nbalancing risk and reward. If we ensure that our resolution system makes management bear the \ncosts of the bad decisions and risk s they take, we also need to le t them reap the rewards of the \ngood decisions. At the very least, new kinds of ma rket distortions might be created by injecting a \ndegree of disconnect between compensation and pe rformance – the same kind of disconnect that \nsome might suggest fosters the type of  carelessness we saw in this crisis. \nLet me give you one example. Let’s say one of the largest financial institutions wanted to \npay a trader a $100 million bonus based on performan ce. I’m not a trader, but I know there is no \nway to earn enough money on trading to gene rate a $100 million bonus without taking open \npositions, which in this example is making bets on behalf of a company that has a major role in our nations’ payments system. If the trader wins , the company makes money. If the trader loses, \ntaxpayers fund the bailout because the institution is large and systemically important. The real \n\n6 \n problem with this scenario is that the company is  too big to fail, not that they are willing to pay \nan enormous sum of money as a bonus. If it’s thei r money, or the money of their shareholders or \ncreditors, I am in favor of letting them set compensation levels. If it’s the money of U.S. \ntaxpayers, then it’s an outrage. Mandating an orderly receivership if the institution fails assures that they gamble w ith their own money. \nIt is also important to acknow ledge that policing such an executive compensation policy \nwill be difficult and inconsistent. For those who are angry about individuals profiting obscenely \nfrom a crisis, it will do nothing to prevent that. Many investors did so during this crisis by rightly \ninterpreting that the government wo uld bail out failed inst itutions and that th e stock prices would \nrecover. Heads I win, tails the public loses is a on e-way bet. It’s not capit alism; it is bad policy. \nOnce again, I suggest that ending too-big-to-fail is th e first step in addressing compensation \nissues. \n \nConsumer Protection \nAnother headline issue in the regulatory reform package relates to the proposed \nConsumer Financial Protection Agen cy. Fair treatment of consumers is extremely important. We \ndo a lot of work throughout our District on cons umer education and consumer issues. Our Bank \nalso hosts a nationwide call cente r on behalf of the entire Fe deral Reserve System. Consumers \ncan contact us by phone\n1 – and they will talk to an actual person, not a machine – or online at \nwww.FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov  to discuss problems related to any financial institution, \nregardless of the regulatory agency  involved. These calls are extrem ely illuminating in what they \ntell us about the relationship between consumers a nd financial institutions. First of all, we handle \nabout 40,000 consumer questions a year, which suggests a lot of  concern and often confusion \nabout consumer rights under the law. However, 90 percent of the complaints we receive are \ntargeted on the largest banks and most often rela ted to credit card issues. Very few complaints \nare made against community banks. And, after th ese complaints have been investigated, few \nagainst community banks are actually found to i nvolve violations of th e consumer protection \nrules. This suggests that  clarification or simp lification of consumer protection rules may be \nnecessary for consumers to better understand what their protections  are under the law. \n                                                             \n1 888‐851‐1920 \n\n7 \n I think we also need to recognize that, while effective consumer protection is a critical \nfoundation of our financial system, weaknesses or ga ps in the enforcement of these laws was not \nthe only factor, or even the driving factor , behind the run-up of subprime lending and the \nresulting wave of foreclosures. What we experi enced was a distortion of incentives in financial \nmarkets amid inflated real estate prices, skyroc keting demand for mortgage backed securities and \na resulting deterioration in underw riting standards for many lenders as they rushed to originate \nmore loans. These dynamics caused too many loans to be extended without a reasonable \nprobability of repayment. The consequences were, of course, disastrous when the housing market \ncollapsed. This experience raises important questions about the incentives involved in \nsecuritizing loans, the ab ility of consumers to receive a loan with little or no upfront money, and \nthe role of nonbank firms, among other issues. Ther e are also lessons to be learned about the \nscope and effectiveness of consum er protection laws, as well as the expectations for regulators \nenforcing these laws.   \nThere are more discussions and debates to take place on this topic, and it is the choice of \nCongress to decide. My experience tells me, howev er, that comprehensive oversight of banks is \nimportant for both effective and efficient supe rvision. Under the coordinated approach we \ncurrently utilize, our goal is  to create a good outcome for consumers and depositors through \nensuring a financially sound and well-managed banking operation that complies with specific \nconsumer protection rules. Separating those functi ons will create inefficiencies in information \ncollection and analysis, and add an additiona l layer of communication and coordination.   \nBut in any case, the fact remains that the c onsumer and the public more generally will be \nbest served if we address the root cause of the abuse that many unfor tunate consumers have \nsuffered during the crisis. We must change the incentives and enhance th e accountability of the \ninstitutions that generated the complex products th at served the principle goal of generating fees \nrather than being sound loan products. \n \n Solution \nMany times in the last year I have expressed my astonishment that Congress was able to \napprove $700 billion in TARP f unds in approximately one week and yet 18 months have passed \nsince Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan and there is still no resolution authority for the \nlargest financial firms.  \n\n8 \n Failure resolution for these largest firms and other yet-to-be-defined systemically \nimportant firms is part of the proposed reform package now before Congress. Unfortunately, the \nproposal does not adequately addres s the too-big-to-fail problem in that it still provides too much \nlatitude to rescue failing firms.  It confirms the practice of addr essing failure of the largest firms \nin an ad hoc manner with individuals rather than  the rule of law decidi ng which firms get rescued \nand which do not. As eager as we might be to ad dress the shortcomings of our financial system, \nwe must also be careful to get it right.  Without mandatory resolution authority direct ed under “the rule of law” for the largest \nfirms, financial reform will be incomplete and in effective. Management will remain able to game \nthe compensation programs that we define, and consumers will be subject to higher fees and \nunfair treatment, even under a new regulator, should it come to be. There can be no confidence in \nthe system until there is a sense of fairness in the treatment of institutions whereby management \nand investors are held accountable for their decisi ons regardless of their firm’s size. We all know \nthe names of these firms. They were central to  this crisis as it expanded and became a global \nrecession. However, while the crisis caused workers to  lose their jobs and families to forfeit their \nhomes, the stockholders and creditors of thes e firms enjoyed special protection funded by the \nAmerican taxpayer.  \nTo begin with, the legislati on needs to establis h a mandatory, non negotiable resolution \nprocess for too-big-to-fail firms that are no longe r viable as a going concern due to insufficient \ncapital or liquidity. With appropr iate legislation, failing firms c ould still avoid liquidation or a \ndrawn-out bankruptcy process. Instead, they would be  put into receivership or conservatorship so \nas to provide an orderly pro cess for maintaining essential se rvices and avoiding systemic \ninstability while making management, shareholders  and creditors accountable for their decisions. \nThe resolution process would apply to every fina ncial institution whose problems might threaten \nfinancial or economic stability a nd is involved in the “plumbing” of the financial system – that \nis, those involved in the payments system and the provision of liquidity within the financial \nsystem.  \nA resolution process where creditors bear losses commensurate with their investment \ndecisions would be significantly le ss costly to the taxpayer than th e price we are currently paying \nin lost jobs, lost economic grow th and actual outlays of public f unds. Alternatively, if we do not \nfind a way to end too-big-to-fail, the largest institutions retain an inequitable competitive \n\n9 \n advantage, will continue to escape market discip line and are incented to engage in practices that \nultimately harm the financial system.  \nA sound resolution process would provide greate r assurance of equita ble treatment for all \nparties, which is essential in a democratic, cap italist system. As a nation, we will soon need to \naddress other enormous financial challenges, such as reducing the budget deficit and providing \nfuture funding for Social Security and Medicare. We must not fool ourselves that citizens will – \nor should – accept higher taxes or reduced be nefits until we have addressed existing \nvulnerabilities in our financial sy stem that risk public funds.  \nTo those who say that some firms are too big to  fail, I wholeheartedly  agree that some are \ntoo big. However, these firms can be unwound in a manner that does not cause irreparable harm \nto our economy and financial system but actually strengthens it for the long run. As a regulator \nduring the banking crisis of the 1980s, I was involved in closing hundreds of failed institutions. Continental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest and most complex bank holding \ncompanies, was taken into receivership is an orderly fashion.  \nI have testified before Congress on this issu e and recently offered a detailed process that \nwould hold the ownership and senior management  of these institutions  accountable for their \nactions when their firms fail. The businesses w ould then be restructured through a prescribed \nprocess under the rule of law. If  you are interested in the details  of this plan, I encourage you to \nvisit our website, www.KansasCityFed.org\n, where you can review it in  its entirety. I am not \naware of any other proposal that  would prevent situati ons like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers \nand Merrill Lynch from being handled exact ly the same way. That is unacceptable. \n \nCONCLUSION \n  While some argue that m oving legislation quickly forward gives us a better outcome \nsooner, my view is that this approach will result  in a set of unintended c onsequences with a more \nexpensive outcome. I have no doubt that all policymakers involved in the debate have the same \ngoals of benefitting the consumer, the industry a nd the nation’s economy. That is why I believe \nthe full package of regulatory reform deserves mo re time for careful c onsideration and national \ndebate, but resolution authority is well over a year  too late.

        "content": "Regulatory Reform and the Economy: \nWe Can Do Better \n \n \n      \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n       \nDenver, Colorado \nOctober 6, 2009 \n \n \n \n \n\n2 \n I want to thank you for attending this ev ening’s Economic Forum, hosted by the Denver \nBranch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. When Congress created the Federal Reserve \nin 1913, they believed very strongly that the na tion’s central bank could not be an institution \nisolated inside Washington. Inst ead, they recognized the importan ce of distribu ting the Federal \nReserve’s responsibility broadly across the nation, creating regiona l Federal Reserve Banks that \nserve specific regions of the country. The regi onal Banks and Bank Branches, like the one here \nin Denver, are under the direction of local boards. Our directors pl ay a key role in connecting the \nFederal Reserve and its policy deliberations direc tly to the communities we serve. We have two \nDenver-area directors on the Ka nsas City office’s board, and the seven-member Denver board \nincludes four Denver-area director s. I would like to recognize how  important these Coloradans \nare to the success of our work and thank each of them for their service to our nation’s central \nbank. \n \nCHALLENGES \nIn the past when I have spoken at this program, my comments have focused almost \nentirely on the economic outlook. In that regard, I can tell you that I see nothing that conflicts \nwith the widely held opinion that we are in recovery. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and \nwe are starting to see improvement in busine ss and manufacturing. Addi tionally, yield spreads \nbetween low-risk assets, such as Treasuries, and higher risk assets are na rrowing. They are not at \nprerecession levels, but there is a clear indicat ion that investors are more willing to provide \ncapital, which is extremely important. A vast amount  of stimulus has been put in place to spark \nthis recovery, and I believe it wi ll prevent a double-dip recession.  \nThe stimulus will, however, present its own challenges. The Federal Reserve and other \ncentral banks around the world will have to unw ind the extensive policy accommodation used to \nhalt the economy’s decline. That will be a de licate process because removing too soon could \nreturn the economy to recession while waiting too long will foster an inflationary spiral. The \nprocess will be particularly deli cate for this recovery because it will proceed slowly, hampered \nby a significant debt overhang and uncertainty  around the condition of some of the largest \nfinancial institutions. Thus, the challenge to mone tary policy is to act in such a manner that you \nencourage the recovery while not fo stering conditions for a future cr isis, albeit one of a different \nnature.  \n\n3 \n As policy is discussed and even debated, it is important to note that the current fed funds \nrate is zero. We all know that the neutral rate is not zero. Equally obvi ous to me is that a rate of 1 \nor 2 percent is not tight monetary policy – it is  still very accommodative.  As we consider our \nchoices, I would not support a tight monetary policy in the current environment, but my \nexperience tells me that we will need to remove our very accommodative policy sooner rather than later. Even if we were to start immedi ately, much time would pass before incremental \nincreases could be considered tight or even neutral policy. \nMonetary policy, however, is not the only area where we will have to consider the long-\nterm implications of our actions as we emerge from  this crisis. In that regard, I think the best use \nof my time here this evening will be to explai n why I think the hard decisions are ahead in the \narea of regulatory reform, which is currently unde r consideration in Congress. Looking at some \nof the policy issues that have emerged in recent  weeks, it seems the public debate continues to \ndistract from what I judge was the primary cause of  this crisis. We must address the issue of too \nbig to fail or we will repeat the mistakes of the past, with ever-worsening consequences. I know \nwe can do better. \n \nREGULATORY REFORM \nToo Big to Fail \nReform in the regulation and oversight of our financial system clearly is needed. As sure \nas we know that tomorrow will arrive, we know that  a financial crisis will occur again at some \ntime in the future. Therefore, the most important  exercise that we s hould undertake now is to \nensure that problems at large financial institu tions are not allowed to  jeopardize the basic \nsurvival of our financial system and economy.  \nHow do we do that?  How do we prevent ince ntive compensation schemes that carry high \ncosts to taxpayers? How do we best protect the consumer from unfair and deceptive practices by \nfirms that are currently unregulated or under-re gulated? While the Administration has taken an \nimportant initial step to address these lapses in our financial system, it is focusing first on \nsymptoms rather than the disease.  \nAdam Smith is often thought of as the E nglish-speaking world’s father of modern \neconomics. He is widely known for hi s book titled, The Wealth of Nations\n, in which he provided \n\n4 \n his analogy that a market economy was like an invi sible hand guiding resources  to their best use. \nLess well-known is another passage in  that book in which he warns that: \n \n“The interest of the dealers … is always in some resp ects different from, and even opposite to, that of the \npublic. To widen the market and to narrow the competition is  always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market \nmay frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be \nagainst it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by ra ising their profits above what they naturally would be, to \nlevy … an absurd tax upon … their fellow-citizens. The pr oposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which \ncomes from this order ought always to be listened to w ith great precaution…. It comes from an order of men whose \ninterest is never exactly the same with  that of the public, who have generally  an interest to deceive and even to \noppress the public, and who … upon many o ccasions, both deceived and oppressed it.” \n \nTo get a sense of what Adam Smith is talk ing about, I would point out that in 1999 the \nCongress passed a piece of legisl ation, heavily endorsed by our la rgest banking firms, called the \nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This le gislation ended the separation of  commercial and investment \nbanking. It broadened the market and allowed for th e accelerated growth of  large financial firms \nin the United States, turning them into institutio ns that were thought to be “too big to fail.”   \nThis should not be dismissed as a populist vi ew of these institutions, but one that is \nsupported by the data. It is best seen by examin ing the advantages that accrued to these firms \nwith respect to their capital levels. The market, knowing these firms were too big to fail, \ntolerated an ever-expanding levera ge ratio, relative to owner equit y. For example, if you look at \nthe 20 largest instituti ons, their equity-to-assets ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was \nabout 4.3 percent. If you look at th e next smaller group of institutions , their equity-to-assets ratio \nwas almost 6.5 percent. The smaller institutions simply must carry lower leverage ratio because \nall those in the market – management, shareholders  and creditors – know they  will lose their jobs \nand investments if they make d ecisions that cause their banks to  fail. This type of market \ndiscipline is less immediate to the owners  and creditors of th e larger firms.  \nIf you were to place these larg est institutions under the same leverage constraints as the \nsmaller firms – at least 6.5 percent equity to asse t – these larger firms would need to raise more \nthan $275 billion in new capital or shrink their assets by more than $4 trillion. This capital \ndifference is an overwhelming advantage to these largest firms and, indeed, has enabled them to \nnarrow the competition to an incredible degree. Si nce the change in law, the largest 20 firms \nhave increased their control of the nation’s banking assets from about 35 percent to an \n\n5 \n astonishing 70 percent. Even more  striking perhaps is the fact th at some of these firms are now \n30 to 40 percent larger than they were when th is crisis began, and as you know, many of these \nfirms were protected during the crisis.  \nWhen the crisis unfolded and these largest fi rms were at risk of failure, Congress passed \nthe $700 billion TARP legislation. It was done to protect the broa d economy, but it also had the \nadditional effect of institutionalizing t oo big to fail in the United States.  \n \nCompensation \nOne of the ironies of this ac tion is that the management of these firms, even those \nneeding TARP funds to survive,  continues to receive enormous  compensation packages. As a \nresult, one of the issues currently distracti ng Congress and the public is executive compensation. \nI certainly understand the anger directed at the well-paid indi viduals atop large firms that \ncontributed to this crisis. However, a comp rehensive plan for resolving these firms and \ndismissing management, rather than protecting them from failure, woul d address compensation \nissues far more effectively because it would leav e these individuals out of  work and wipe out any \nownership stake they hold. That  does much more for accountability than simply capping an \nindividual’s pay. In fact, there is some question if pay caps could even be firmly implemented – \nas you may know some firms have  already begun to work around compensation limits by raising \nbase salaries to million-dollar levels.  \nCompensation restrictions also  call into question the tenants of capitalism in terms of \nbalancing risk and reward. If we ensure that our resolution system makes management bear the \ncosts of the bad decisions and risk s they take, we also need to le t them reap the rewards of the \ngood decisions. At the very least, new kinds of ma rket distortions might be created by injecting a \ndegree of disconnect between compensation and pe rformance – the same kind of disconnect that \nsome might suggest fosters the type of  carelessness we saw in this crisis. \nLet me give you one example. Let’s say one of the largest financial institutions wanted to \npay a trader a $100 million bonus based on performan ce. I’m not a trader, but I know there is no \nway to earn enough money on trading to gene rate a $100 million bonus without taking open \npositions, which in this example is making bets on behalf of a company that has a major role in our nations’ payments system. If the trader wins , the company makes money. If the trader loses, \ntaxpayers fund the bailout because the institution is large and systemically important. The real \n\n6 \n problem with this scenario is that the company is  too big to fail, not that they are willing to pay \nan enormous sum of money as a bonus. If it’s thei r money, or the money of their shareholders or \ncreditors, I am in favor of letting them set compensation levels. If it’s the money of U.S. \ntaxpayers, then it’s an outrage. Mandating an orderly receivership if the institution fails assures that they gamble w ith their own money. \nIt is also important to acknow ledge that policing such an executive compensation policy \nwill be difficult and inconsistent. For those who are angry about individuals profiting obscenely \nfrom a crisis, it will do nothing to prevent that. Many investors did so during this crisis by rightly \ninterpreting that the government wo uld bail out failed inst itutions and that th e stock prices would \nrecover. Heads I win, tails the public loses is a on e-way bet. It’s not capit alism; it is bad policy. \nOnce again, I suggest that ending too-big-to-fail is th e first step in addressing compensation \nissues. \n \nConsumer Protection \nAnother headline issue in the regulatory reform package relates to the proposed \nConsumer Financial Protection Agen cy. Fair treatment of consumers is extremely important. We \ndo a lot of work throughout our District on cons umer education and consumer issues. Our Bank \nalso hosts a nationwide call cente r on behalf of the entire Fe deral Reserve System. Consumers \ncan contact us by phone\n1 – and they will talk to an actual person, not a machine – or online at \nwww.FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov  to discuss problems related to any financial institution, \nregardless of the regulatory agency  involved. These calls are extrem ely illuminating in what they \ntell us about the relationship between consumers a nd financial institutions. First of all, we handle \nabout 40,000 consumer questions a year, which suggests a lot of  concern and often confusion \nabout consumer rights under the law. However, 90 percent of the complaints we receive are \ntargeted on the largest banks and most often rela ted to credit card issues. Very few complaints \nare made against community banks. And, after th ese complaints have been investigated, few \nagainst community banks are actually found to i nvolve violations of th e consumer protection \nrules. This suggests that  clarification or simp lification of consumer protection rules may be \nnecessary for consumers to better understand what their protections  are under the law. \n                                                             \n1 888‐851‐1920 \n\n7 \n I think we also need to recognize that, while effective consumer protection is a critical \nfoundation of our financial system, weaknesses or ga ps in the enforcement of these laws was not \nthe only factor, or even the driving factor , behind the run-up of subprime lending and the \nresulting wave of foreclosures. What we experi enced was a distortion of incentives in financial \nmarkets amid inflated real estate prices, skyroc keting demand for mortgage backed securities and \na resulting deterioration in underw riting standards for many lenders as they rushed to originate \nmore loans. These dynamics caused too many loans to be extended without a reasonable \nprobability of repayment. The consequences were, of course, disastrous when the housing market \ncollapsed. This experience raises important questions about the incentives involved in \nsecuritizing loans, the ab ility of consumers to receive a loan with little or no upfront money, and \nthe role of nonbank firms, among other issues. Ther e are also lessons to be learned about the \nscope and effectiveness of consum er protection laws, as well as the expectations for regulators \nenforcing these laws.   \nThere are more discussions and debates to take place on this topic, and it is the choice of \nCongress to decide. My experience tells me, howev er, that comprehensive oversight of banks is \nimportant for both effective and efficient supe rvision. Under the coordinated approach we \ncurrently utilize, our goal is  to create a good outcome for consumers and depositors through \nensuring a financially sound and well-managed banking operation that complies with specific \nconsumer protection rules. Separating those functi ons will create inefficiencies in information \ncollection and analysis, and add an additiona l layer of communication and coordination.   \nBut in any case, the fact remains that the c onsumer and the public more generally will be \nbest served if we address the root cause of the abuse that many unfor tunate consumers have \nsuffered during the crisis. We must change the incentives and enhance th e accountability of the \ninstitutions that generated the complex products th at served the principle goal of generating fees \nrather than being sound loan products. \n \n Solution \nMany times in the last year I have expressed my astonishment that Congress was able to \napprove $700 billion in TARP f unds in approximately one week and yet 18 months have passed \nsince Bear Stearns was acquired by JPMorgan and there is still no resolution authority for the \nlargest financial firms.  \n\n8 \n Failure resolution for these largest firms and other yet-to-be-defined systemically \nimportant firms is part of the proposed reform package now before Congress. Unfortunately, the \nproposal does not adequately addres s the too-big-to-fail problem in that it still provides too much \nlatitude to rescue failing firms.  It confirms the practice of addr essing failure of the largest firms \nin an ad hoc manner with individuals rather than  the rule of law decidi ng which firms get rescued \nand which do not. As eager as we might be to ad dress the shortcomings of our financial system, \nwe must also be careful to get it right.  Without mandatory resolution authority direct ed under “the rule of law” for the largest \nfirms, financial reform will be incomplete and in effective. Management will remain able to game \nthe compensation programs that we define, and consumers will be subject to higher fees and \nunfair treatment, even under a new regulator, should it come to be. There can be no confidence in \nthe system until there is a sense of fairness in the treatment of institutions whereby management \nand investors are held accountable for their decisi ons regardless of their firm’s size. We all know \nthe names of these firms. They were central to  this crisis as it expanded and became a global \nrecession. However, while the crisis caused workers to  lose their jobs and families to forfeit their \nhomes, the stockholders and creditors of thes e firms enjoyed special protection funded by the \nAmerican taxpayer.  \nTo begin with, the legislati on needs to establis h a mandatory, non negotiable resolution \nprocess for too-big-to-fail firms that are no longe r viable as a going concern due to insufficient \ncapital or liquidity.

Hoenig President Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City          Kansas Bankers Association 2009 Annual Meeting August 6, 2009            The views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  This text was prepared from a transcript of Mr. Hoenig’s remarks.  \n\nI want to thank the Kansas Bankers Association for inviting me here today and for giving me the opportunity to speak on what I consider to be increasingly important challenges confronting our economy in the coming months and years.  The challenges are focused around the common theme of debt and leverage as it impacts the banking industry, government, business and consumers.  How we address these challenges will also affect how the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy as we emerge from this recession and beyond.   I’ll start by focusing on the banking industry and the challenge of too-big-to-fail.  The matter of a resolution process for failed large banks must be addressed before the financial system can be fully healed and functional.  Then I will speak on the broader issue of debt, federal government, business and consumer, and the challenges it presents for policy.  These topics are important because, as citizens, we have some very difficult choices before us that will impact us and future generations. Throughout my presentation, I will share a number of charts that illustrate the magnitude of debt and leverage in the economy.  The advantages of too-big-to-fail Chart 1 is a picture of leverage in the banking system and illustrates the enormous advantage of being too big to fail. For example, at the end of the first quarter of this year, the 20 largest financial institutions in the United States controlled more than $12 trillion in assets, supported by more than 3.5 percent equity capital. This chart illustrates how little equity supports that massive amount of assets and risk.  The next group of financial institutions, the non-top 20 financial institutions ($500 million to $100 billion in assets) has an equity capital ratio of 6 percent—notably higher than that of the largest banks. \n\nChart 1 \n Assume for a moment that the 20 largest institutions were required either to raise new equity, or to reduce their total assets to meet the 6 percent equity capital ratio.  This would require that they raise more than $300 billion in new capital or, as Chart 2 shows, they would need to shrink in size by $5 trillion, or some combination of the two options. The numbers in Chart 2 make clear how much of an advantage the larger institutions have over smaller banks, and show the excess leverage the largest banks have accumulated.      3.2%3.2%3.6%6.0%02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000Billions of Dollars Total Assets(less Tier 1 Common)Tier 1 Common\nTop 5Top 10Top 20Non-Top 20Tier 1 Common as % of Total Assets\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 2009]Notes: Graph includes only BHCs that filed the Y9-C which excludes approximately $2 trillion in assets. Tier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest. Non-Top 20 includes bank holding companies with $500 million to $100 billion in assets.\n\nChart 2         \n  It is no longer conjecture that the largest institutions in the United States have been determined to be too big to fail.   They have been bailed out, and proposed legislation allows for that practice to continue.  They have an implied guarantee, which affords them an enormous advantage in terms of their use of leverage and their ability to accumulate assets to unprecedented levels.  The large banks have added capital since the end of the first quarter, but they are far short of achieving a 6 percent ratio of equity capital to assets.  Ironically perhaps, some proposals being offered would require large institutions to hold more than this level of capital.  I would $3,916$5,020$5,118\n6.0%02,0004,0006,0008,00010,00012,00014,000\nTop 5 Top 10 Top 20 Non-Top 20Billions of Dollars Current AssetsTied to ExcessLeverageTotal Asset LevelSupported by Existing Tier 1 CommonExistingTier 1 Common\nSource: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated Condition [March 2009]Notes: Tier 1 Common = Tier 1 Capital less Preferred Stock, Related Surplus and Minority Interest. Total Assets Supported by Existing Tier 1 Common Supported Assets assumes 6% Tier 1 Common to Total Assets\n\nsuggest such proposals are wishful thinking, and will not be achieved.  I would be pleased if these largest institutions were held to the same standards as the non-top 20 firms because the community banking system cannot survive if the largest banks continue with their current advantage, and that obviously has significant adverse effects for the financial system as a whole. There were two pieces of legislation that facilitated our migration toward too big to fail.  Chart 3 illustrates the relative growth in position of the largest institutions against the timeline of Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, which permitted banks to grow across state lines, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which eliminated the separation of commercial banking and investment banking.  Since 1990, the largest 20 institutions grew from controlling about 35 percent of industry assets to controlling 70 percent of assets today.  This trend will continue unless we take specific steps to end it.  The way we normally address failure in a capitalistic system is to subject any institution, from the largest institution to the smallest, to the same penalties for bad management. To accomplish this, we must pass legislation mandating that institutions that become insolvent, due to liquidity or capital, be taken over in an orderly fashion and placed under a conservatorship or receivership.  In such an instance, both the equity holders and long-term debt holders should share the losses before the taxpayer is required to bail out the institution. Taking over the failed institution in an orderly fashion—not a panicked fashion—would protect the franchise and, more importantly, protect the economy from instability.  As I have described elsewhere, a resolution framework can be designed that is fair and much more efficient for the economy.  As we have handled the largest institutions through this crisis, they are not market-driven institutions, they are public utilities. This has to change or we \n\nwill not retain the dynamic financial system that has made the United States so successful over its history.  Chart 3 \n  Difficult choices While staying with the theme of debt and difficult choices, I am going to turn next to the challenge of the growing debt levels within our economy and the challenges they present for monetary policy makers, starting with federal debt levels.   0.150.250.350.450.550.650.75\n0.150.250.350.450.550.650.75PercentPercent\n5101520Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994*Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999\nNotes:  *Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 allowed for interstate acquisitions Sources: Bank Holding Company Reports of Consolidated ConditionParent Company Only Financial StatementsConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income19861988 19901992 1994199619982000200220042006 2008Industry Concentration in Top Bank Holding Companies[1986 to Present]\n\nIt is the responsibility of us citizens, through our congressional representatives, to decide how much our government spends and how we allocate those expenditures, which nominally increased to $3 trillion in 2008 from less than $500 billion in 1975.  Medicare, income security, Social Security and veteran’s benefits make up more than half of government spending. Federal outlays also include national defense, education, interest payments on the debt and other expenditures. These expenditures are substantial, and they may grow further as we set forth on implementing a stimulus package and tackle some very difficult health-care issues.  Both these initiatives involve legitimate goals, and it is not my place here to debate the merits or the arguments surrounding them. However, as Chart 4 shows, we need to understand that we, through our government, have already made significant long-term commitments and choices in allocating federal resources.

We are spending 8 percent of our total federal budget just to make the interest payments on that debt, and that too will only increase.

Chart 6 shows that consumer and nonfinancial business debt are each now more than 130 percent of our national income.  Consumer leverage has actually worsened as consumer wealth has declined during this recession due to the collapse in housing and the decline in U.S. equity markets.  Chart 6   \n In an environment where debt is large and growing, low interest rates are preferred by nearly everyone: the government, bankers and bank customers. The desire for low interest rates will put incredible pressure on the Federal Reserve and the central banks of the world to keep rates low. Since Paul Volcker broke the inflationary cycle of the late ’70s and early ’80s, Chart 7 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000\n01975197819811984198719901993199619992002200520085,00010,00015,00020,00025,000DebtConsumer DebtNonfinancial BusinessS&L GovernmentBillions of DollarsBillions of Dollars\nNote: The source is Flow of Funds.

Consequently, we are carrying more debt than we have carried in most of our history, and the pressure to keep rates low is only going to increase as the economy begins to recover from this recession.  Chart 7   \n Chart 8 shows that low interest rates have coincided with a growing level of money in the economy, which the Federal Reserve defines as M2.   Chart 9 suggests further that this growth in money over these past several decades has had a staggering effect on the consumer price level.

That’s an astonishing increase in the general price level, and it represents a significant reduction in the purchasing power of the dollar over time.  These are matters that demand our attention as we make choices involving both fiscal and monetary policy.            Chart 8            \n  In considering these charts and the matters of policy, we should be aware of two pieces of legislation that I suggest influenced their contours: the 1946 Employment Act and the 1977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act. The 1946 Employment Act established as a national priority a goal of low unemployment.  Low unemployment is a worthy goal and one that I share, but it cannot be achieved by systematically keeping interest rates low.  In 1977, Congress passed the Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act—also called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act—which 01975 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2003 2005 2007 200920011,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,0008,0009,000MoneyBillions of Dollars\nSource: Board of Governors. Money is defined as M2, a broad set of financial assets held principally by households. M2 consists of the sum of (1) currency, (2) traveler's checks, (3) demand deposits, (4) other checkable deposits, (5) savings deposits, (6) small-denomination time deposits, and (7) balances in retail money market mutual funds.  \n\ncalled upon the Federal Reserve, as the central bank of the United States, to pursue a dual mandate of promoting long-run stable economic growth and stable prices. Chart 9    \n  Though I am convinced we can achieve both mandates, I also am convinced that both are only possible if the first priority of the central bank is to achieve stable prices.  Understandably, however, many prefer that the emphasis be on growth and low unemployment.   Although the Federal Reserve is insulated from politics, it is not isolated from politics, as you can observe by the frequent congressional testimony of Ben Bernanke and past chairmen. The Federal Reserve System is accountable to Congress for achieving the dual mandate, and the data suggest it has given important deference to the growth objective.    05001914 1924 1934 1944 1954 1964 1974 1984 1994 20041000150020002500Consumer Price IndexIndex, Price Level in 1914 = 1001977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act1946 Employment Act\n\nRecession and recovery These issues provide context for the monetary policy choices that lie ahead. Based on the data we are receiving today, it would appear that we are at the bottom of the recession. The data are mixed, which is usually a sign that we are at the bottom. However, these mixed data also make it difficult to determine just how firmly or quickly we will emerge from the recession. Given the large amounts of consumer, business and government debt that will influence events going forward, I suspect we’re going to recover slowly.  The recovery will be assisted by the fiscal stimulus and an accommodative monetary policy, but it most likely will be slowed by the extensive rebalancing of the economy that has yet to occur. In this environment, one of the Federal Reserve’s major challenges will be how to pull back its highly accommodative monetary policy without undermining the recovery and not igniting inflationary expectations.   We learned in the Great Depression and with the Japanese experience that we have to pull back gently.  At the same time, however, we also learned from the great inflation of the ’70s that we have to be resolute in pulling excess stimulus back or risk greater consequences in the future.  We are going to be walking the “knife’s edge” for some time to come.   In considering this challenge it is important also to realize first that more than half of the current fiscal stimulus package has yet to be spent, so we have yet to see its full effects. In addition, monetary policy remains exceptionally accommodative and will provide significant stimulus into 2010 and beyond.    Focusing more narrowly on monetary policy, the excess reserves in the banking system now exceed $800 billion; they were less than $8 billion when this recession started. The balance sheets of the Federal Reserve Banks have increased from $900 billion to more than $2 trillion in \n\nless than two years. As we become more confident that we are at the bottom of the recession and are moving into recovery, we must become more resolute in systematically reducing our balance sheet and raising interest rates to levels we might all agree are more in line with the economy’s long-run growth path.  Moving from zero to one percent, for example, is not a tight policy.  I don’t know what the neutral rate is, but I am certain it isn’t zero. If the monetary stimulus does not come out, the price level trend shown earlier in Chart 9 will only worsen. As a reminder of what that might imply, you need only study the early ’80s when high inflation undermined our economic system.  Paul Volcker’s efforts to bring inflation down then were not without cost and required that the country suffer through a recession nearly as bad as the one we hope we are exiting now.   Conclusion If the government, the banks and consumers address the difficult issues of debt and the Federal Reserve begins to remove the significant stimulus in an orderly fashion, then we will come out of this recession without an inflationary hangover. Noninflationary growth will follow, new wealth will be generated, and we will continue to be the strongest, most successful economy in the world. But in the short run, these actions will involve painful choices, and it is the responsibility of citizens like you, and policymakers like me, to consider the impact of today’s choices on tomorrow. We must choose well."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n    \n“Bankruptcy and the Financial Crisis” \nStern School of Business, New York University \nNew York, N.Y. \nJune 30, 2009 \n \n\n2 \n Introduction  \nThank you for inviting me here today for wh at is an especially timely discussion.  \nThose who are familiar with my public remark s know that I do not accept that some firms \nare “too big to fail.”  I do not be lieve it's inevitable or desirable to continue to have too-big-to-\nfail financial institutions because they pose an on going threat to financial stability.  Now is the \ntime to seriously consider a mandatory resoluti on process based on an obj ective set of criteria \nthat puts the largest financial organizations on notice they won’t recei ve a disproportionate \nsubsidy or guarantee.  \nWhen the financial crisis was unfolding, publ ic authorities responded with a number of \nad hoc steps. These actions kept afloat seve ral large financial and nonfinancial firms whose \ncollapse many thought would prove devastating to the financial system and the economy.  The \nnames of the institutions are well known: AIG,  Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and \nMerrill Lynch. There were also initiatives to  support financial sector firms through TARP \nmoney. \nWith few exceptions, the steps taken to s upport these firms were outside the normal \nframework established to deal with troubled entities. The re lated actions raise important \nquestions around too big to fail and whether tr aditional corporate bankruptcy procedures and \nbank receiverships are adequate to the task of re solving failed firms.  The options chosen also \nraise important issues of fairness and the equity  of outcomes.  We know that public assistance \ninvolves political choice, which t oo often undermines market discip line and the proc ess of failure \nand renewal so essential to the long-r un success of our capitalistic system.   \n\n3 \n In my remarks this afternoon, I will discuss the role that I believe bankruptcy and bank \nreceivership authority must play in a financial crisis, the lessons we should learn from our recent \nexperience, and what steps we should put in place to deal with future disruptions.  \n \nThe resolution of depository instit utions and corporate bankruptcies \nManaging insolvency for depository institutions differs markedly from what we do with \nmost other corporations. Although we have ma ny experts here on both bank resolution and \ncorporate bankruptcy, I would like to briefly compare these appro aches before discussing issues \naround the resolution of larg e failing institutions. \nOur approach in dealing with insolvent banks  is largely based on the idea that because \nbanks serve a critical role in the payments a nd credit systems, their failures involve potential \ncostly externalities. Bank failures, of any size, could lead to significant di sruptions in the ability \nof individuals and businesses with in a community to carry out timel y transactions.  Furthermore, \nif the largest institutions are involved, these disruptions could bring about a systemic breakdown \nin financial markets and cause substa ntial harm to the overall economy.   \nThe primary focus in bank resolutions is to protect depositors at the least cost to the \ninsurance fund and, wherever possible, ensure continued access to ba nking services with \nminimal disruption to the overall economy. This requires timely action. As such, bank \nresolutions occur under an admini strative process with the FDIC acting as receiver.  The FDIC \nhas a number of “superpowers” it can use in its role, including the ability to reorganize or \nrestructure a failed bank, sell portions of the bank’s assets and operati ons, and repudiate certain \ntypes of claims and contracts.  \nOverall, the bank resolution process m oves quickly through prescribed steps. \n\n4 \n The failure of nonfinancial corporations i nvolves a more deliberative process. Although \nthe failure of these firms may have a significan t effect on individuals and economic outcomes, \nthey do not pose the same type of liquidity a nd systemic issues as the failure of a bank. \nConsequently, the resoluti on process differs in some important ways from that of banks; most \nnotably the resolutions are handled through the ba nkruptcy courts and are initiated either by a \nfirm’s creditors or its managers. The court pro cess concentrates on maximizing the value of the \nfirm and the creditors’ claims either through the firm’s liquidation or as an ongoing concern.  \nBankruptcy courts, moreover, could be characterized as part of a “time out” process in which \nneutral judges work with creditor s and other parties to resolve conflicts of interest and protect \ncreditors. \nDespite the differences in these two processes,  there are important commonalities as well.  \nIn both cases there is a strict set of procedures established under th e rule of law that sets out, for \nexample, a “priority of claims.”  Also, both fo cus on an orderly process and equitable outcomes \nwith care being taken to minimi ze political factors that might otherwise interfere with the \nresolution process. \n \nLessons to be learned \nAlthough we have a legal framework for dealing with failing institutions, we have \nlearned that, in a crisis, the “systemic spillover”  that can emerge from failures of our largest \ninstitutions and the threat to  the broad economy require additi onal consideration.  The most \nrecent examples of this have led to the susp ension of normal bankruptcy and bank resolution \nprocesses, thus institutionalizing the concept of too big to fail in our economic system. \n\n5 \n Even outside of the banking system, major securities firms and AIG, an insurance \ncompany, were thought to be systemically signi ficant because of their many connections and \nexposures with other firms and markets. Theref ore, it was concluded they could not be put \nthrough bankruptcy.  Many view the bankruptcy of Lehman Brot hers and its aftermath as a \njustification for bailing out other large financial institutions.  \nBut we have also learned, or been reminded, that too big to fail has adverse consequences \nas well.  Every financial crisis leaves a trail of losses embedde d among market participants.  The \nprocess of recovery must start with the recognition of these losses, which then must be distributed among the participants.  Moreover, in some instances the extent of the losses \nultimately requires the recapitalization or closing of the institutions and the replacement of the \nmanagement responsible for the failure.  When excep tions are made to this process for any set of \ninstitutions, especially our largest, this proce ss of recovery is delaye d or compromised.  In \naddition, taxpayers most often must bear the bur den of recapitalizing too-big-to-fail institutions, \nplacing billions of dollars of their funds at ris k.  And too often, the management who created the \nproblems or who failed to demonstrate the leader ship necessary to properly run the institution \nremains in place.   \nSuch interventions tend to break down market discipline and involve public authorities, \nnot the market, choosing winners and losers.  In  FDIC receivership or bankruptcy, institutions \nand claimants must deal with usi ng tested procedures and a set of rules that help ensure that all \nparties, regardless of size, are tr eated comparably. With too big to fail, this process is suspended \nand firms are treated differentl y based on one criterion: size. \n\n6 \n Thus, while in the middle of a crisis, short cu ts to tested resolution processes may appear \nand even be necessary, they almost certainly l eave us with a less efficient and less competitive \nmarketplace.    \n \nWhat steps should we take?  \nAs policymakers consider the administra tion’s recent proposal for a new resolution \nauthority for systemically important financial in stitutions, it is crucial that we ask ourselves \nseveral important questions.  For example, given wh at we have learned from this crisis, how can \nwe address the issue of systemic vulnerability th at is inherent in any system with institutions \nallowed to be too big to fail?  How can we better assure that managers, stockholders and \ncreditors know that there will be a credible sy stem that puts them at risk?  And how can we \nresolve large institu tions without raising systemic concerns  or disrupting key financial activities \nor markets?  I suggest there ar e three fundamental steps to addr essing the matter of too big to \nfail.   \nFirst, there needs to be a se t of basic rules of performan ce that apply to systemically \nimportant institutions.  I would emphasize that these rules need to be easily understood and \nenforceable.  For example, I strongly support si mple leverage standards for setting capital \nrequirements at financial instit utions.  Leverage re strictions, once assigned, are simple to \nunderstand and calculate.  They are straightforward to enforce and, if enforced appropriately, are \ncountercyclical.  Risk-based capit al standards, in cont rast, are complex, procyclical, and easier to \navoid.  Many institutions, in fact, have signifi cantly underestimated their risk exposure over the \nlast few years. These errors could have left them  with even greater capital shortages if they had \nbeen free to follow a true risk-based capital appr oach. While no system is perfect, clear and firm \n\n7 \n rules are easier to understand and enforce.  Pr inciples-based oversigh t is an exercise in \nphilosophy, not a supervisory framework.  \nSecond, there must be a clearly defined reso lution regime for systemically important \nfirms that are in financial trouble.  When addr essing serious problems, such a regime should set \nforth fundamental steps that ensure a continu ity of key operations but  which also carefully \nconfine policymakers from making special  exceptions to a defined process. \nSome have well illustrated the responses a ssociated with the recent crises to an \nemergency crew acting to save a burning home before it destroys th e entire neighborhood. I \nagree  that acting to save the neighborhood was important. However, to extend the metaphor, if \nthe fire was started by a homeowner who ignor ed fire codes and smoked in bed, should the \nneighbors be required to rebuild the home at twice its original si ze at their expense? \nWhile we could have addressed the too big to fail issue with current tools, a statutorily \nsanctioned resolution process would significantly im prove our ability to deal with failed large \nbank holding companies and large nonbank financ ial institutions. The Tr easury Department’s \nplan for Financial Regulatory Reform and its  resolution regime for failing bank and other \nfinancial holding companies provide a starting po int for discussing the is sue of too big to fail \ninstitutions, but it is only a start. \nIn the proposal there are a num ber of issues that deserve careful consideration. They \ninclude, for example, how solvency recomm endations would be determined among the \nconsolidated and financial subsid iary regulators. Also, the proce ss will need to be much more \nspecific in how we determine which institutions a nd activities would be regarded as systemic and \ncome under the federal safety net or public protection. For example, I would limit such \nboundaries to those institutions that  are directly and indirectly part of our economy’s plumbing: \n\n8 \n our system for payments and for the provision of liquidity.  Inside these boundaries would be all \nbanks and bank holding companies and any institu tion that has direct access to the payments \nsystem and to the Federal Reserve discount wind ow.  On the other hand, hedge funds would be \noutside the boundaries of the safety net, although they could be required to register and report \nunder SEC rules.  The plan must also more preci sely define how the cost of resolving a large \ninstitution would best be  distributed.  Such cost s are substantial and should be allocated to those \ninstitutions that benefit the most  from the public safety net.  \nThe most important part of any plan, how ever, will be the requirement that public \nauthorities resolve such institut ions by taking them into receivership and restructuring them to \nemerge under new and more careful management  and ownership. This step should be taken \nwhenever the chartering and supervisory authoritie s judge an institution to be insolvent from a \nliquidity or balance sheet pers pective, and I would advocate no  exceptions.  If a resolution \nprocess exists, then few, if any, exceptions will be necessary. \nUnder the pressure of a crisis, as we have  seen, it is difficult to avoid a piecemeal \napproach to dealing with systemically importa nt institutions with all of the unintended \nconsequences that seem to follow.  Thus, our en ergies in refining the pr oposed legislation should \nfocus on how best to narrow the exceptions a nd assure that a receiv ership or bankruptcy \nframework operates according to the rule of law and insulated from political interference. In \nbanking, Congress has set the receiv ership rules with independent  regulators making solvency \ndecisions and carrying out the reso lution process. A similar format must be part of the resolution \nprocess for systemically important, large financial organizations.   \n\n9 \n Third, in resolving issues around any failed firm, especially too big to fail firms, \nmanagement and stockholders must be accountable  for their actions. Restructured firms must \nhave new – and more careful – management and ownership. \nToo often institutions drift w ithout a clear vision of the or ganization’s goals with no one \nmaking the hard decisions. Other shortcomings include a failure or unwillingness to understand \nthe financial instruments the institution holds, re lying on mechanics rather than sound judgment.  \nToo often management has a greater concern fo r expanding the balance sheet than for managing \nexisting activities. Within today’s largest orga nizations, we have lear ned of individuals who \nwillingly carried a hefty title for the purpose of representation of the organization but with no \nunderstanding – and no requirement or desire to  understand – the busine ss lines, operations or \ncondition of the organization.  From the volume of  complaints blaming rating agencies for the \ncurrent crisis, it seems that far too few senior execu tives in these largest organizations believed it \nwas their responsibility to understand the fi nancial products their company was buying and \ntrading in quantities of billions and trillions of dollars.  This  is not only unaccept able, but also a \ndereliction of duty.   \nDealing with leadership issues is challe nging and should be addressed by respective \nboards and stockholders. But if a board fails to do so, then the compa ny’s likelihood of failure \nincreases.  When failure occurs, certainly new management must be required as part of any \nresolution process. One might observe that a CE O and his board of directors are hardly in a \nposition to be angry with any government-impos ed restrictions on compensation when they \nneglected their responsibility to manage a sound company.  \nA final point that needs to be highlighted is that there must be confidence in the fairness \nof any resolution process if it is to be successful over time . Capitalism works only if all \n\n10 \n competitors are held to the same standard and have equal opportunities to succeed or fail.  With \ntoo big to fail, capitalism is compromised and equ ity of opportunity is sacr ificed to expediency. \nThe vast majority of banks in the United States have complied with regulations and \nrequirements that, though necessary, are costly. Th ese banks have played by the rules or suffered \nthe consequences of not doing so during market turmoil. Understandably, today these smaller \ninstitutions are concerned about  the prospect of increased re gulatory requirements and an \nincreased competitive advantage that flows to the largest firms.  Such an outcome would \nundermine confidence in the market system th at has brought this c ountry past success. \n \nConclusion \nThe current crisis has made it clear that the group of systemically important firms that \nmight be deemed worthy of special consideratio n by policymakers is larger than previously \nthought. This extension of the too big to fail co ncept, along with the wide variety of public \nassistance and guarantees we’ve seen used in rece nt months, make it even more important that \npolicymakers find ways to deal with large failing institutions.  \nFailing to have a process that operates according to the rule of law and is free of political \ninfluence means an even larger section of our financial markets will operate on the assumption \nthat the idea of failure – a key element in mark et discipline – does not apply in all instances. \nOnce this happens, it will be difficult for other institutions to survive and compete, and for our \nmarkets to be competitive and efficient.  Importantl y, it will not be realistic for any authority in \nany regulatory structure to oversee a system where incentives remain to take on excessive risk."

It is \na pleasure to be here, and it has been a genuine opportunity for the directors and staff of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to learn firs t hand what is happening in this part of our \nregion.   \nIn thinking about the long run while cont emplating the current economic situation, I \nwould humbly amend the famous observation of economist John Maynard Keynes. In the long \nrun, we are all dead but our childr en will be left to pick up the ta b.  With that in mind, today I \nwill focus on some of the longer-run challenges we  face as we emerge from the current financial \nand economic crisis. These challenges can most certa inly be dealt with, but they require that we \nbegin now to address them genuinely and systemati cally or we risk repea ting past mistakes and \ncreating an environment that lead s to our next set of crises. \n \nNear-term outlook \nI’ll begin my remarks by stating that my view of the more immediate outlook for the U.S. \neconomy is that we will emerge from this recessi on – perhaps as soon as the second half of this \nyear, but most likely in early 2010, as many econom ists project. If for no other reason, the \neconomy should respond positively to the significant degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus that \nhas been directed into the economy over the past several months.  Let me briefly describe those \nactions. \nMonetary policy is enormously accommodative, w ith the fed funds rate being near zero.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s lending programs and support of the housing market provides significant \nadditional liquidity and stimulus  to our financial markets and economy.  The Federal Reserve is \nin the process of purchasing longer-term assets  including Treasury secu rities, which adds  \n \n\n3 \n \nsignificant stimulus.  In total, these actions will increase the Federal Reserve Banks’ combined \nbalance sheets to more than $3 trillion from less than $1 trillion less than two years ago.  \nFiscal policy also has been highly expansionary  and will provide trillions in stimulus over \nthe coming quarters and years.  For example, th e Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) placed \n$700 billion into the financial indus try and parts of the auto industr y just within the past eight \nmonths. The fiscal stimulus package recently im plemented into law provides nearly $800 billion \nin tax cuts, grants to state governments, expanded jobless benefits and sign ificant infrastructure \nspending on highways and other tr ansportation enhancements, a nd on clean energy initiatives \nthat are unprecedented in size and scope. Frankly, it would be surprising if the economy failed to \nrecover based on the magnitude of thes e monetary and fiscal programs.  \nDespite these actions, I expect  the recovery to be more modest than some economists \nproject. The U.S. economy is working through a seri es of difficult structural adjustments, as are \nmany of our trading partners. Our financial institutions remain fragile and will require significant \nadditional amounts of capital to regain their stabili ty. How we choose to do this will affect the \npublic’s confidence in these inst itutions and their ability to support the recovery. The housing \nmarket continues to struggle as it downsizes fr om past financial and sp eculative excesses and the \nassociated misallocation of resources. Consumers are adjusting to a significant loss in wealth \nassociated with the declining housing and stock markets, and job losses.  Recovery in these \ncircumstances will take time and require patience if  we are to avoid mistakes in our efforts to \nbring the economy forward.   \nThus, while I am convinced that the economic recovery we all want will develop, it will \nbe slower and more fragile than we hope for. \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nFixes for the long run \n This recession is often described as the wo rst in post-World War II history, and that may \nvery well be correct.  From it will flow a host of po licy issues that will require careful review and  \nhard choices if we are to assure  our national economy’s long-term strength and vitality.  In this \nregard, I would like to direct th e remainder of my remarks to th ree policy issues: the need to \naddress fundamental weaknesses w ithin our financial system; the need to address significant \nimbalances within the U.S. economy; and the need to act to avoid an infl ationary outbreak that \ncould come with current fi scal and monetary policy.  \n \nThe financial system  \n  Over the past year, we have  seen the U.S. financial system  nearly collapse.  Financial \ninstitution failures have include d Bear Stearns, Fannie and Fre ddie, and Lehman Brothers.  \nMeanwhile, billions of dollars  in taxpayer money have b een needed by CitiGroup, Bank of \nAmerica and AIG.  The panic that followed these events affected the broader economy, \nworsening the current recession.  It is apparent that we need a bette r set of incentiv es within the \nindustry and better oversight by the regulatory authorities if we ar e to avoid a repeat of these \nevents in the future.  Moreover, if we hesitate to make needed changes, we will perpetuate an \noligarchy of interests that will fail to serve the best interest of business, the consumer and the \nU.S. economy.  \n In our efforts to fix the oversight pro cess for our financial system, we should not \nmisdiagnose the patient. Unfortunately, I’m afraid we are witnessing some regulatory \nmalpractice now. The emphasis on reform at this moment is to change the structure of the \nregulatory system rather than address the fundament al weakness of that system.  Leading to this \ncrisis were a series of steps that eliminated or compromised financial standa rds that had served to  \n\n5 \n \nsupport sound financial practices fo r generations.  For the most part, these rules were simple in \nform, understandable and enforceable.  They se rved to constrain excessive leverage and \nundisciplined growth using simple leverage ratios, and they focused on fundamental  \nunderwriting standards such as limits on loan-to-va lue.   Accordingly, I am convinced that before \nwe spend time and energy restructuring the regul atory system, we should first determine which \nrules of conduct should be reintr oduced and enforced to provide for better outcomes. Perhaps in \nthe end there will be consensus to change our oversight structure, but I suspect reestablishing and then enforcing rules that have proven effectiv e over time will do more than the make-work \nexercise of regulatory restructur ing.  After all, England has one regulator and has fared no better \nin the current financial crisis.   \nIn discussing any aspect of financial refo rm, one of the most significant changes that \nmust be accomplished is the end of “Too Big To Fail.”  If nothing else, this current financial \ncrisis has confirmed its existence.  Capitalism is  a process of success, failure and renewal, and \nfor it to work properly, institutions must be a llowed to fail, no matter their size or political \ninfluence.  Institutions that are considered too big to fail have an implied subsidy.  Research suggests that these firms are thought to have a lower cost of funds and a competitive advantage \nover their less “systemically important” competit ors.   Too big to fail introduces a “moral \nhazard” problem for society where creditors of these firms lessen their due-diligence programs \nknowing that they will be bailed out by the government  should the institutions fail.  The effect is \nto lower the costs to these firm s and significantly raise costs to the taxpayer and, ultimately, to \nfundamentally weaken our financial system.   \nFinally, ending too big to fa il is not the same as endorsing a disorderly liquidation \nprocess for institutions.  Rather it demands a mark et-oriented solution to poor performance.  It \nrequires a resolution process that holds management  and investors accounta ble for their actions  \n\n6 \n \nand, properly structured, it provides for an orderl y transition to new owners hip or the closing of \nthe institution with the least disruption to the market and economy.  I have previously outlined \nvarious examples of how this might be done base d on what has worked in our financial history \nand in other countries.  It is imperative that we learn from these examples.  If we do not address \nthis issue, we will certainly i nvite a repeat of the recent fina ncial turmoil and its devastating \neffect on our economy. \n \nImbalances and economic stability   \nOver the past two decades, the U.S. has created for itself a set of economic imbalances \nthat, in my judgment, have significantly increa sed uncertainty and placed economic growth at \nrisk for future generations of Americans.  That is  a serious statement to make, so let me set out a \nfew facts to illustrate my point.  As a nation, th e U.S. has been living beyond its means for many \nyears.  The U.S. current account balance since 1990 has declined steadily from approximately in \nbalance to a deficit of 6.5 per cent of our GDP in 2005, and it remain s at nearly 4 percent of GDP \ntoday.  At its peak, this equates to almost $900 billion that the U.S. has borrowed from the rest of \nthe world on an annual basis.  If this were be ing used to finance produc tive investment, I would \nnot be overly concerned because the returns we  earn could finance the cost of borrowing.  \nUnfortunately, however, a large share of  U.S. imports is for consumption. \nThe reality of this imbalance is brought furt her into focus when we realize that U.S. \nconsumption as a percent of GDP has increased from an already relativ ely high 66 percent in  \n1990 to 70 percent in 2006 and remains near this leve l even today.  Just as significant is the fact \nthat U.S. aggregate personal savings had fallen from  an already low rate of 5 percent of GDP in \n1990 to near zero in 2006.  More significant still is the fact that for the same period, consumer \ndebt to income increased from a high of 84 percent to nearly 135 percent.  \n\n7 \n \nFinally, our federal government has, except for a short period at the end of the ’90s, run \nits own chronic annual deficit, whic h is projected to approach $2 tril lion this fiscal year and will \nremain large for years to come. Moreover, thes e projections do not include the effects of \nadditional trillions of dollars of  unfunded promises we have made to ourselves to provide Social \nSecurity and Medicare bene fits for decades to come. \nBecause the U.S. economy is so large and, by hi storical standards, so successful, it has \nthe capacity to carry such imbalances far longe r than most economies would be permitted in \ntoday’s global markets. However, such an adva ntage will eventually end and comes with its own \ncosts.  Over time, an ever-increasing amount of national and personal debt will raise the cost of \ncapital. As these costs increase, investment will slow and cause lower productivity, yet an \nimproving level of productivity is what is required to maintain a high standard of living.   The \ndecrease in economic growth will most likely come slowly and be modest, but its compounding \neffects over future generations will be significant.  For exampl e, over a 25-year period, a 25-\nbasis-point reduction in real GDP  growth would imply a difference of nearly 6 percent in the \nlevel of GDP, all else equal, as we economists like to say.  In other words, seemingly small \npercentages can have an enormous  impact on future generations. \n \nThe inflation challenge  \n            It is one thing to outline the challe nges we face, it is quite another to address them.  To \nillustrate this point, I would direct you to an article by Martin Barnes, the managing editor of  \nThe Bank Credit Analyst , published this May.  In estimating th e effect on consumption growth if \nthe annual savings rate steadily increased from zero toward 8 percent between now and the end \nof 2013, the article suggests that consumer spendi ng would grow at an average rate of only 1.3 \npercent per year.  This would be  a significant reduction of consump tion growth, the slowest since  \n\n8 \n \nthe 1930s.  There can be little doubt that such a growth rate would have a significant adjustment \neffect, even if only temporary, not only on the U. S., but also on the rest of the world. For the \nU.S., it most likely would imply the need to shif t resources toward the export sector, and for our \ntrading partners, it would mean re lying less on sales to the U.S.  \nStarting from where we are today, it is clear th at interest rates must  rise. As the economy \nrecovers, even at a modest pace, resource demands will begin to increase. At this point, the current level of monetary accommodation will need to be withdrawn to avoid introducing \ninflationary impulses. Also, with the almost certain adjustments that need to occur in \nconsumption, savings and the rebalancing of im ports and exports, I expect there would be \nadditional pressure for interest rates to rise  steadily over time. To the extent that these \nadjustments will require considerable time to co mplete, unemployment levels, for example, may \ndecline more slowly than anyone wants.  \nIf such a set of events occurs , then I also suspect there will be considerable pressure on \nthe central bank to “help out” in easing this adju stment process by keeping interest rates low for \nan extended period.  This happens because people often confuse the establis hment of low interest \nrates – and therefore the creation of money – with the creation of  wealth.  Sadly, through history, \nit has been shown repeatedly th at excessive reliance on monetary  policy as a means to avoid  \nfundamental economic policy choices leads to hi gh inflation and an actual worsening of an \neconomy’s long-term performance. I hope the U.S. can avoid the temptation to take policy short cuts as we emerge from this recession.  We f ace difficult adjustments that must yet be made. The \nprocess will not be free of pain.  \n\n9 \n \nThe Federal Reserve System over the past ne arly two years has more than doubled its \nbalance sheet as it has provided liquidity and m onetary stimulus to the U.S. and world economy.  \nIn doing so, it has served to staunch the financia l and economic panic.  But it now must turn to \nthe matter of carefully removing this  stimulus at the very time that consumers, businesses and the \ngovernment will need to fund pent-up demand fo r goods and services and to meet committed \nobligations.  There is little doubt  that such a “coincidence” of needs will place upward pressure \non interest rates.  Central banks will have little choi ce but to allow these increases to occur or \nrisk the consequence of higher in flation, perhaps significantly higher.  As I said, this process of \nremoving past monetary accommodation will be resisted.  However, in contemplating this process and the pain of adjustment, I often em phasize that inflation is the least fair, most \nregressive and most corrosive tax we can impose on ourselves. It is particularly harsh for low- to \nmoderate-income citizens. \nFinally, the markets won’t be fooled by ar tificially low rates for long.  Market \nparticipants realize that a pe riod of high deficits and accomm odative monetary policy are an \ninvitation to increased inflationary  pressure. I suspect we are expe riencing the first signs of the \nmarkets’ concerns in the rising rates and increased volatility in longer-term Treasury markets. I \nsuggest strongly that we need to be alert to th e markets’ message and be gin in earnest to bring \nmonetary policy into bett er balance before inflation forces our hand. \n \nConclusion \nAs we emerge from this global financial crisis and recession, the United States must \naddress a series of significant financial and econo mic imbalances and risks.  In dealing with \nthese challenges, the Federal Reserve must stay  focused on our mission and make the tough – if  \n\n10 \n \nunpopular – decisions that will he lp guide our economy into be tter condition.  A central bank’s \nmission remains that of holding the trust of the public by providing a stable currency that retains \nits purchasing power over time.  It  is for governments and businesse s to allocate resources that \naddress our economic challenges.  These are not  things that a central bank should address \ndirectly.   No matter how well-intentioned, to a ttempt to do so goes beyond its mission and risks \ndelaying and worsening the inevitable adjustment."

Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n         \n \n \n \n     \nECB/De Nederlandsche Bank Conference,  \nFrankfurt,  \nMay 25, 2009 \n \n \n\n2 \n \nThank you for the opportunity to be here today a nd participate in this conference on retail \nbanking and the role of central banks.  It is a pleasure for me to join you and provide my \nperspective on the U.S. retail payments system.   \nDiscussion regarding this topi c could not be more timely. Retail payments in the United \nStates and worldwide have undergone an enorm ous transformation over th e past decade driven \nby technology and, just as importantly, notable cha nges in consumer preference.  We get a sense \nof this change from a recent Federal Reserve study indicating that electronic payments now \nexceed two-thirds of all noncash payments in the United States. The efficiency, convenience, \nspeed and ease of use have fueled this transforma tion and will continue to do so for some time to \ncome. \nConsistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandate to ensure the integrity and efficiency of \nthe payments system, we were a strong advocate of the migration of pa yments to electronic \nmechanisms.  Though the electronic nature of retail payments has affected the Federal Reserve’s \ntraditional role, the Federal Reserve’s mandate has not changed.  Although some question \nwhether the Federal Reserve can or should play an important role in retail payments over the \nlong term, a strong case can be made for expa nding the Federal Reserve’s role in electronic \npayments if it is to fulfill its mandate.  \nToday I will discuss my own view that the Federal Reserve should not be contemplating \nan exit from retail payments. Coupled with the ri se in electronic payments products, a dramatic \nchange in the structure of the payments indus try has introduced new challenges to assuring the \ncompetitiveness and safety of this system.  The industry’s structure has been heavily influenced by economies of scale, which has brought with it an increased level of conc entration in debit and \ncredit markets.  For example, in 2007, the three largest PIN debit networks handled more than 81 \n\n3 \n \npercent of all transaction volume. Comparatively,  in 1995, the three larges t networks controlled \nonly 46 percent of the market. More  striking, perhaps, is the fact  that over the same period, the \nnumber of networks dropped from 43 to 14.  Si milar trends are evident in signature debit and \ncredit card issuance.  And, of course, in the Un ited States, three networ ks have long dominated \ncredit card clearing.  To me, these devel opments raise important concerns about the \ncompetitiveness of card payments systems. \nThere are also reasons to be concerned about th e integrity of this system.  Growing levels \nof concentration and an increasi ng complexity of systems have i nvited greater vulnerability to \ndisruption and an enhanced poten tial for “single points of failur e.”  The increasing complexity \nhas raised the opportunity for fraud. There also  has been a growth in the prominence of \nnonbanks, introducing new ri sks to the system. \nIn light of these developments, I believe th at the Federal Reserve needs to continue \nplaying a strong role in retail payments.  Before  looking more closely at what role the Federal \nReserve could play in the future, it may be usef ul to consider the economic rationale for central \nbank involvement in retail payments more ge nerally.  This rationale revolves around the \nexistence of externalities that potentially underm ine the efficiency and integrity of payments \nsystems. \nPayments products and services require a cri tical mass of participan ts on two sides of a \nmarket.  For example, a significant number of merchants must be willing to accept a specific \nform of payment before consumers will use it. Conversely, a substantial number of consumers \nmust use that form of payment before merchants will consider installing any necessary equipment or software.  In this situation, a ne w product or network might not develop because, at \nthe individual level where such choices are ma de, neither consumers nor  businesses have an \n\n4 \n \nincentive to use the product. Both sides, however , might benefit if such a product was in place. \nSuch externalities, in which individual benefits  or costs do not coincide  with those accruing to \nsociety, can justify a public sector role in providing the service. \nSimilarly, there are possible externalities re lated to coordination. Situations arise in \npayments markets where coordination among particip ants benefits both participants and users — \nfor example, adoption of uniform standards or a common technology.  But agreements around \ncommon standards or technology are difficult to achieve because par ticipants vary in size and \npreferences.  In addition there can be a “free-rider” problem, wh ere those that stay outside the \nprocess avoid cost associated with any agreem ent that might be made. The result is an \nunderprovision of services or products. One es pecially important ex ample is the potential \n“underinvestment” in payments security by the pr ivate sector, for example, the continued use of \nmagnetic strip authentication for credit cards rather than more secure smart card authentication. \nThese externalities help explain the Federal Re serve’s traditional role in retail payments, \nespecially its role as operator in check pro cessing and ACH. Its early check processing \ninvolvement was largely a response to the fragment ed nature of the industry as payments carried \nacross literally thousands of co mmercial banks dispersed across  a wide geographic area.  Non-\npar clearing was the norm, and remote locations  were inadequately served.  Under such \ncircumstances, it took only a few years for the Fe deral Reserve System to be involved in roughly \n50 percent of the value cleared through clearinghouses.  By entering the market and ultimately becoming a prominent participant, the Fed was, in  effect, addressing coor dination difficulties and \nnetwork effects.  Similarly, it was instrumental  in the 1950s and 1960s in working with industry \nparticipants to establish the MICR standard a nd to develop high-speed sorting equipment. \n\n5 \n \nWith regard to ACH, in the 1970s, the Fede ral Reserve assumed a leadership role in \npromoting this technology to provide an alte rnative for bank-to-bank small dollar payments. \nPrivate sector banks, facing high startup cost s and low ACH volumes, were understandably \nreluctant to invest in a new network. Without bank participation, there would not be consumer \ninvolvement. The Fed’s participation helped addr ess this externality. It became one of the key \nACH operators, and for a few years following imple mentation of the Monetary Control Act, it \nsubsidized the ACH network. Over time, a criti cal mass was achieved, and today the ACH is one \nof the nation’s most heavily used retail payments systems. \nIn light of the trend toward greater industry concentration a nd the existence of important \npayments system externalities, the Federal Reserv e should play a larger an d more active role in \nelectronic retail payments if it wants to promote the efficiency and integrity of the payments \nsystem.  The key question is how this role shou ld be defined.  While the Federal Reserve could \nfocus more on regulation and overs ight to achieve its mandate as many other central banks are \ndoing, I suggest that it should leverage its experi ence and position as an operator to achieve its \nobjectives. \nHistorically, the Federal Reserve’s role in both checks and ACH reflects a preference to \noperate within the market rather than as a pure regulator. We ar e well aware that industries can – \nand do – quickly develop methods to exploit any regulatory loopholes and avoid the intended \noutcome.  By competing with the private sector on a level playing field, the Federal Reserve can \nencourage efficiency and integrity  from an “on the ground” position.  \nLooking forward, I also suggest that it could do so in the r ealm of electronic payments \nmore broadly.  The Federal Reserve’s operati onal role will likely revolve around its ACH  \n\n6 \n \nplatform. Currently, the Federal Re serve is filling an important role in an ACH industry where \nthe Electronics Payments Network (EPN) is the only other active op erator, and where the \nelimination of either party leaves a highly c oncentrated and less competitive market. While a \nrecent joint processing venture announced by Bank of America and Wells Fargo may spur the entry of a third ACH operator, economies of scale make entry difficult, especially in these times \nwhere capital is scarce and expensive. Without the Fed, it seems unlikely that a more competitive environment would emerge. \nACH volume has been steadily increasing in r ecent years with significant growth in \nnontraditional payments, such as Internet trans actions and the conversion of paper checks to \nelectronic debits. Moreover, the volume and nature of ACH tran sactions have evolved to the \npoint where the ACH network is clearly of syst emwide importance so that a major disruption \ncould have significant effects on the paymen ts system and the broader economy.     \nThus, in my view, the Federal Reserve’s futu re role in retail pa yments should be built \naround its current position in ACH.  For example, in its operator role, the Federal Reserve could \naugment its ACH products and services, with the ai m of enhancing competition and safety within \nthe ACH industry.  An example where this is occurring is with same-day ACH settlement, which the Federal Reserve recently announced it will be gin to offer in the second quarter of 2010. This \nwill provide originating and receiving banks the option to accelerate the clearing and settlement \nof certain ACH debit payments, which will provide  an earlier opportunity to  identify return items \nand reduce risk.   \n\n7 \n \nThe Federal Reserve could also work with EPN to provide reciprocal backup services \nwith each other as well as with other electr onic payments networks, and thereby serve as a \n“switch of last resort.”  Such a role would prove invaluable in the event of  serious disruptions to \nmajor networks, however unlikel y such disruptions might be. \nFinally, the Federal Reserve could enhance competition in payment card markets by \npositioning ACH services as an alte rnative to debit card payment networks.  I am not suggesting \nthe Federal Reserve would issue its own cards or  operate its own card ne twork.  However, the \nFederal Reserve could add enhancements to its ACH network, enabling it to become an \nalternative to running transacti ons over card networks.  The recent development of so-called \ndecoupled debit cards provides an example of the industry making use of the ACH network in \nthis way. \nIn summary, as the payments system continue s to evolve, the Federal Reserve’s role will \nneed to change.  In my view, it would not be de sirable for the Federal Reserve to scale back its \npresence in retail payments or even exit retail payments as some might advocate.  Rather, the \nexistence of important external ities and increasing industry c oncentration suggest that the \nFederal Reserve must stay involved in retail pa yments.  The question, then, is what form this \ninvolvement should take.  Many centr al banks in a similar situati on will likely opt to rely on a \nregulatory and oversight role.  However, in part because of its unique history as an operator, I \nbelieve the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to le verage its traditional operator role to better \nenhance the integrity and effici ency of the payments system."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n     \n \nNew York, NY \nMay 4, 2009 \n \n \n\n2 \n I am pleased to be here today to offer my perspectives on the ongoing financial turmoil. \nIn recent weeks, I have raised concerns a bout the policy response regarding institutions \nconsidered “too big to fail.”  When events began to unfold in August 2007, U.S. policymakers \nreacted quickly to provide liquidity to markets and institutions.  And, as matters deteriorated, \nthere was a further escalation of policy intervention s to an extent not seen  since the 1930s.  Some \ninstitutions have failed, others have received sizable infusions of taxpayer funds to support their \noperations, and the functioning of some key financial markets now depends heavily on \ngovernment support.  Despite these actions a nd some recent signs of improvement, markets \nremain under stress and the near-term outlook for the financial system and the economy remains \nuncertain.  Clearly, the magnitude, nature and scope of this financial cr isis have posed significant \nchallenges for policymakers here and abroad.  The weakening economy has caused financial \ndifficulties to escalate.  But, in my view, the ru sh to respond has had negative consequences as \nwell.  Without a systematic plan for addressing the crisis, poli cy actions have been ad hoc, \nresulting in inequitable outcomes among firms, creditors and investors that have increased \nuncertainty and undermined confidence.  Nowhere is this more apparent than  in the treatment of \nlarge, complex financial institut ions that have been labeled as  “systemically important” and “too \nbig to fail.” \nToday, I would like to place my recent discussion of the resolution of these large problem \ninstitutions in a somewhat broader context by taking a closer look at how we got into this \ndifficulty and by discussing some of the longer-r un consequences of the actions being taken to \nresolve the crisis.  \n\n3 \n Context for the Crisis  \n Many factors contributed to the financial exces ses that spawned this crisis.  But, at the \nroot of our problems is a collectiv e failure of market discipline and public policy.  Over the past \nthree decades, we have seen enormous growth in financial markets and institutions around the world.  This growth has been spurred by technologi cal advances and financ ial innovation.  But, it \nwas also supported by a philosophy that financial in stitutions and supervis ors have the tools to \nmeasure and control risk while policymakers mainta ined an environment of stable prices and low \ninterest rates.  This philosophy, moreover, led ma ny financial institutions and investors to take \non more leverage, hold less in liquid funds, and downplay the risks of many of the new financial \ninstruments and counterparty rela tionships.  Also, the removal of  certain barriers to geographic \nand activity expansion in banking provided an ad ditional incentive that helped pave the way for \never larger financial institutions, whose failu re could have broad re percussions across the \nfinancial system and the economy. \n This new system of finance relies more heav ily on market discipline to manage risks and \nmaintain stability.  But, as we have seen, ther e have also been factor s that have served to \nundermine market discipline.  These include: the increased complexity of financial instruments; \ninstitutional features that di storted incentives to take, m easure and manage risks; and, \nimportantly, the view that large complex financial institutions would not be  allowed to fail.  I \nthink it is also fair to say that all regulators were compl acent in performing their oversight \nresponsibilities in an environmen t of strong economic growth, low inflation and strong financial \nperformance.    These financial developments were suppor ted by a very favorable macroeconomic \nenvironment, where a decline in inflation worl dwide allowed central banks to maintain low \n\n4 \n interest rates and ample credit av ailability, making debt and leverage  more attractive.  With these \nfavorable financial and macroeconomic devel opments extending over a long period of time -- \npunctuated only occasionally by fina ncial crises in some emerging market economies -- it is not \ntoo surprising that policymakers ignored the nays ayers who warned of weaknesses in this system \nand did not develop a systematic plan for dealing w ith a major financial crisis such as the one we \nare currently confronting. Crisis Resolution\n  \n From this introduction, let me now turn to my view on the resolution of large, complex \nfinancial institutions.  While you may be familiar with some of my more  recent remarks on the \n“too big to fail” issue, I have been concerned with this problem  for some time.  Previously, I \nsaid, “In a world dominated by mega financial in stitutions, governments could be reluctant to \nclose those that become troubled for fear of sy stemic effects on the financial system.  To the \nextent these institutions become too big to fail, and where uninsured depositors and other \ncreditors are protected by implicit government guara ntees, the consequences ca n be quite serious.  \nIndeed, the result may be a less stable and a less efficient financial system .” I also noted that \n“recent history throughout the world suggests that “too big to fail” may be the policy of choice in \ncrisis situations, particularly when mega instituti ons play a large role in a country’s economy and \nfinancial markets.”  I made these comme nts not this year, but in March 1999.1 \nIn recent weeks, I have outlined a resolution framework for how we deal with the large, \nsystemically important institutions at the center of this crisis in the United States.  Boiled down to its simplest elements, the pl an would require those firms seek ing government assistance to put \nthe taxpayer senior to all shareholders with  the impact on managers and directors depending on \n                                                \n \n1 “Financial Industry Megamergers and Policy Challenges,” March 25, 1999.   \nAvailable at: www.kansascityfed.org/home/subwebnav.cfm?level=3&theID=9983&SubWeb=6 \n\n5 \n the viability of the firm.  Nonvi able institutions would be allowed to fail and be placed into a \nnegotiated conservatorship or a bridge institution, with the bad assets liquidated while the \nremainder of the firm is operated under new mana gement and reprivatized as soon as feasible. \nThis plan is similar to what was done in Swed en in the 1990s and what we did in the United \nStates with the failure of Continental Illinois in the 1980s.  \nThis plan has many advantages, including th at management and shareholders bear the \ncosts for their actions before taxpayer funds are committed.  This process also is equitable across \nall firms; is similar to what we now do with sm aller banks; and provides a definitive process for \nreducing market uncertainty.  These all are impor tant reasons we must implement this kind of \nresolution process. \nIn contrast to this suggested approach, a policy of “too big to fail” rais es important issues.  \nFor example, it worsens the already significant problem of moral hazard in which investors do \nnot monitor risk appropriately, assuming, correctly  it would seem, that the government will bail \nthem out of financial problems.  Capitalism is a process of failure and re newal, and a policy that \nundermines this process makes the financia l system and our economy less efficient. \nAlso, when firms are treated as “too big to fail,” they receive an implied subsidy and a \ncompetitive advantage over other firms.  Critics of the approach I suggest have raised three main objections.  Fi rst, they argue that \nthese institutions are too large a nd complex, with many international linkages, to be resolved in a \ntimely manner.  I agree that thes e resolutions would be complex.  But, historical experience also \nshows that forbearance is often more costly, es pecially to the taxpayer, than resolving the \ninstitutions in a timely manner.  Second, critics su ggest the failure of one of these institutions \ncould be very disruptive and worsen the crisis, ci ting Lehman as an example.  I am not at all \n\n6 \n advocating the approach taken with Lehman.  Rather, I am arguing for a timely, managed and \norderly resolution of large, inso lvent institutions, with their ba sic functions continuing under new \nmanagement.  Third, critics suggest that governme nt resolution of these institutions amount to \ntheir “nationalization.”  I believe this is a misn omer, as we are taking a temporary step that is \naimed at cleaning up a limited number of failed institutions and returning to private ownership as soon as possible.  This is something banking agen cies have done many times before with smaller \ninstitutions and, in selected cases, with very large institutions.  In  many ways it is also similar to \nwhat is done during a corporate bankruptcy, but with an emphasis on en suring continuity of \nservices. Longer-term Consequences\n \n In the heat of a financial crisis, policymak ers are in a reactive mode, especially in the \nabsence of a systematic plan to address the cr isis.  In this environment, it is tempting to \ndownplay the longer-term consequences of short-te rm decisions.  But there are some significant \nimplications of the policy actions taken in this crisis that will shape the financial system and the \neconomic environment in the future.  Let me co nclude my remarks today with a discussion of \nsome of the longer-run consequences of  the policy response to this crisis. \n One key issue, of course, is what financial regulatory structure we  want going forward if \nwe are to prevent a repeat of the current crisis on an even larger scal e.  While much of the \ndiscussion about regulatory reform will focus on who should be the regulator of what institution \nor activity, I believe there are two more important i ssues that need to be addressed.  First, what \nshould be the span of regulation an d the federal safety net; that is , which institutions or segments \nof the market should be covered by government  guarantees and other support mechanisms?  \nAlso, how should these entities be regulated to limit safety net e xposure?  A second key issue is \n\n7 \n how should we deal with large, systemically  important financial institutions on a more \npermanent basis?  In this regard, I fear that if we pour in enough public funds to see us through \nthe current crisis, we will then breathe a si gh of relief and back off from implementing any \ncomprehensive solutions to controlling the use of government guarantees and to addressing the \nproblems posed by systemically important institutions.    In my view, this would be a serious mistake.   While a carefully cons tructed safety net and \na better resolution procedure for la rge institutions are critical, we al so need to think about how to \nprevent such institutions from holding us hostage in the future.  This may require breaking them \nup, limiting their activities or size, increasing capita l requirements, or taking other steps to limit \nthe systemic risks they impos e on the financial system.   \n More broadly, however, during this crisis we have seen an enormous extension of \ngovernment guarantees and support to institutions  and markets that had not previously been \ncovered.  Going forward, we must credibly convin ce financial markets and in stitutions that such \ncoverage will not be easily forthcoming in the future .  A key step in accomplishing this is to take \nthe steps that I have suggested to resolve large problem institutions. If we fail to do so, we will \nsee moral hazard problems escalate far beyond th eir current levels, with enormous adverse \nimplications for the efficiency and stability of our financial system. \n This crisis will also have an enormous fis cal cost that will place a large future burden on \ntaxpayers, even as we come closer to the ts unami of looming Social  Security and Medicare \nobligations.  Going forward, we need to ensure that managers, shareholders and creditors of \nfinancial institutions bear the full costs of their ri sk-taking, and I think we need to make it harder \nfor policymakers to pass these costs on to taxpayers. \n\n8 \n  Finally, let me comment on some of the longe r-run implications of the Federal Reserve’s \nrole in the policy response to this crisis.  Th is crisis has involved segments of the financial \nsystem that operate outside of the traditional federal safety net, which has been limited to depository institutions.  In fact, many of the player s in this crisis would not be given access to the \ndiscount window during normal circumstances and ha ve been subject to little in the way of \nprudential supervision.  The Federa l Reserve’s response to this cr isis in providing liquidity and \nsupport to institutions and markets outside of its traditional purview has been significant, creative \nand timely.    However, in stepping outside its normal s phere of operations and making decisions about \nwhich markets and institutions to support, the Federal Reserve has also moved into credit-\nallocation decisions which are more properly pe rformed by the marketplace itself and by fiscal \nauthorities when necessary.  These decisions have  also caused the Federal Reserve to greatly \nexpand its balance sheet and have almost certainly set expectati on for similar responses in any \nfuture crises.  All of this will make it more diffi cult for the Federal Reserve to quickly remove its \npolicy accommodation in the future and, thereby, will subject it to new te sts of its independence \nas a monetary authority. Concluding Comments\n \n We have expended considerable resources addr essing this difficult crisis, but still, we \nhave a ways to go before markets will function ef fectively without government assistance.  In my \nview, this process will go faster  and with less ultimate cost if we  take decisive steps to resolve \ninsolvent institutions in a timely manner, regardless of their size and complexity.  Over the longer term, we face the difficult task of redesigning our system of financial regulation to \nprovide more stability, while main taining innovation and efficienc y.  This is always a difficult \n\n9 \n balance to strike, but it will be nearly impossi ble if we do not address the problems posed by \nlarge, complex financial institutions."

Hoenig \n \nPresident \n \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \nbefore the \n \nJoint Economic Committee \n \nUnited States Congress \n    \nApril 21, 2009 \n \n     \n\n1 \n Madam Chair Maloney, Vice Chair Schumer,  ranking members Brady and Brownback, \nand members of the committee, I appreciate the o pportunity to talk with you about the issues \nsurrounding the exceptionally large financial institutions whose failure may pose systemic \nthreats to the financial system.  \nThe United States currently faces economic turmoil related dire ctly to a loss of \nconfidence in these large institutions. Although the response to the events of the past year has \ntaken on various forms, so far, we have not seen  the return of confidence and transparency to \nfinancial markets, leaving lenders and invest ors wary of making new commitments. Until that \nfaith is restored, it is impossible fo r us to achieve full economic recovery. \nWhen the crisis began to unfold last year, a nd its full depth was not yet clear, we were \nquick to pump substantial liquidity into the syst em. In the world we find today, with the crisis \ncontinuing and hundreds of thousands of Ameri cans losing their jobs every month, it remains \ntempting to pour additional funds in to these institutions in hope s of a turnaround. We have taken \nthese steps instead of defining a co nsistent plan or addressing the core issue of how to deal with \nthese institutions that now block our path to recovery. Our acti ons so far risk prolonging the \ncrisis while increasing the cost  and raising serious questions about how we eventually unwind \nthese programs without creating another financial crisis as  bad or worse than the one we \ncurrently face. \nThese large and systemically important institu tions are regularly referred to as “too big to \nfail,” but yet we all know that a free market syst em requires that insolvent firms, regardless of \ntheir size, market position or th e complexity of their operations, must fail. We have been \nunwilling to allow this to happen to these firms,  ignoring that we have an existing mechanism \n\n2 \n that can be used for firms of all sizes and allows  for their dissolution while controlling damage to \nthe broader financial system.  \nThere seems to be a prevalent line of thinki ng that the problems we  now face with these \ninstitutions are simply too complex for us to re solve without widespread damage to the financial \nsystem. I don’t think those who managed th e Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the \nResolution Trust Corporation or the Swedish financ ial crisis were provided with a blueprint that \nguaranteed their success. And though I would be th e first to acknowledge that the path I propose \nis not easy, I do not accept the idea that we have lost our ability to solve the challenges we now \nface. \nThis system has a proven track record in the United States as well as abroad and it would \nserve us well in the current crisis. I have included in this written testimony the text of a speech I delivered recently in Tulsa, Okla., that spells out the details of how th is program would work. \nAdditionally, I have included suppl ementary information including further details related to the \nresolution framework for large institutions; th e process used to handle the 1984 failure; of \nContinental Illinois, which was one of our nation’s largest financial institutions at the time of its \nfailure, and the approach Sweden took in respons e to that nation’s banking crisis in the 1990s, \nwhich is very similar in many ways to wh at we face in the United States today. \nIn addition to the current turmoil, from a re gulatory perspective we must also make the \nchanges necessary to protect the financial system from a similar crisis in the future. For some \ntime, there has been an ongoing debate in th e regulatory community pitting proponents of a \nbroad principles-based approach against those fa voring a more rigid rules-based system that can \nbe widely understood and more readily, and even ly, enforced. The current crisis has made the \ncase that the rules system is our only alternative, as the principles-based approach leaves far too \n\n3 \n much open for the discretion of the firms in question and not enough authority for the various \nregulatory agencies.  \nAlong these same lines, this crisis has been th e first real test of the Basel II capital \nframework, and it has failed miserably. Basel II relies on firms making their own detailed \nassessments of the risks they have assumed so  a capital requirement can  be assigned. I would \ndoubt any of us today would believe such a sy stem to be desirable or even workable. \nEnforcement under Basel II relies on examin ers understanding and evaluating extremely \ncomplex mathematical models. When it becomes clear that these models understate capital \nneeds, examiners often have difficulty arguing the technical merits of their views and convincing \nbank management to add capital. In many ways, Basel II provides banks with a rationale, a \ndefense and an opportunity for taking excessive leverage. Banks have strong competitive and financial incentives to increase leverage. Duri ng good times, leverage increases profitability, but \nit also increases risk. We have seen the broad systemic effects of excessive leverage. To limit \nsuch problems in the future, we must maintain limits on financial levera ge through strict rules \nsetting minimum capital-to-asset rati os. It would be the easiest, mo st equitable and clear-cut way \nto set capital requirements for all sizes of ba nks and for a broader range of firms throughout \nfinancial markets. \nOne of the more troubling aspects of this cris is has been that in many ways these events \nhave not been unpredictable. A decade ago, I and others anticipated that the financial \nmegamergers we were seeing at th at time would lead to a situa tion like the one we face today. \nAlthough we did not have any way of knowi ng the events that would provide the \nstimulus for this crisis, there were already c oncerns in 1999 that, “In a world dominated by mega \nfinancial institutions, governments could be reluctan t to close those that b ecome troubled for fear \n\n4 \n of systemic effects on the financial system. To the extent these institutions become ‘too big to \nfail,’ and where uninsured depositors and othe r creditors are protec ted by implicit government \nguarantees, the consequences can be quite serious.  Indeed, the result may be a less stable and a \nless efficient financial system.”1 \nThis is clearly the result we now face, and it is even more pressing that we deal with the \nproblem at hand in a manner that brings stability and transparency back into our system for the \ncurrent environment or it is a certainty that this is an environment in which we will find ourselves yet again.   \n                                                \n \n1 “Financial Industry Megamergers an d Policy Challenges,” speech by Thomas  M.

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n        \nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce \nTulsa, Oklahoma \nApril 9, 2009 \n \n\n6 \n  \n \nAs you all know, we are in the middle of a ve ry serious financial cr isis, and our economy \nis under significant stress. Ther e has been much debate abou t how we should address these \nchallenges, but regardless of the method one supports, all agree that  the economy will not \nrecover until the financial system is st abilized and credit flows improve.   \nThe restoration of normal financial market activity depends on how we deal with the \nproblems of our largest fina ncial institutions. It is has been a li ttle more than a year since the first \nmajor government rescue occurred with Bear Stearns being acquired by JPMorgan. Since then, \nnumerous programs have been enacted and trill ions of dollars of pub lic funds have been \ncommitted, much of it directly to our largest inst itutions. Despite these well-intentioned efforts, \nthe problems remain, and the public’s dissatisfacti on with how their money is being spent grows.  \nIt is not surprising that the initial measures ta ken in this crisis were ad hoc. The depth and \nextent of the problems were not anticipated. Ho wever, more than a year has passed and the \nchallenge that still remains is to define a pl an that addresses the si gnificant asset problems \nembedded in our largest instituti ons. We must provide financial firms, investors and consumers \nwith a clear and fair plan for dealing with  firms that many call “too big to fail.”   \nLast month, I gave a speech that outlined a resolution framework and a plan for how we \nshould deal with these large system ically important financial firms. I believe that failure is an \noption. Those who disagree with my resolution proposal  say that it is unwor kable. In my remarks \ntoday, I will offer more details about how the process would work and explain why I think it is \nthe best solution for getting our financial system and economy on the road to recovery. \n  \n\n7 \n  \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework  \nFor a free market system to be successful , firms must be allowed to fail based upon a \npredefined set of rules and principles that market  participants can rely on when determining their \nstrategies and making decisions. This is particularly important for problem financial institutions. These key principles should a pply if we are talking about a small bank in Tulsa or a large \ninternational financial conglom erate in New York City.   \nThe first principle is to properly understand our goals and correctly identify the problems \nwe are attempting to solve. This may sound obviou s. However, when we are in the middle of a \ncrisis where more than a half million people are losing their jobs every month, it is tempting to \npour money into the institutions thinking that it will correct the problem and get credit flowing \nonce again. Also, rather than letting the market  system objectively discipline the firms through \nfailure and stockholder loss, we tend to microm anage the institutions and punish those within \nreach.  \nThis lack of confidence in the market’s re medy is most acute for our largest financial \ninstitutions, which have publically  disclosed substantial losses. Th e question that the supervisory \nauthorities must answer is whethe r the losses are large enough to th reaten the solvency of any of \nthese firms. This assessment is the first step in  determining actions necessary to restoring public \nconfidence in our financial system.  \nA second principle is that we must do what is best for the overall economy and not what \nis best for one group. We need to make sure th at when one financial firm fails, the resolution \nprocess does not cause significant disruptions to financial market s and the economy or make the \n\n8 \n current problems worse. Furthermore, we must do it for the lowest possible cost so that we don’t \ncreate a long-term fis cal burden on taxpayers. \nIt is important to recognize that there are not  just the direct cost s but, more importantly, \nlong-term costs to the economy and financial syst em. The direct cost of resolving a failed bank, \nsuch as the government bearing some of a failed ba nk’s losses, is simple to determine. However, \nit is much more difficult to know the costs fr om some of the unintended consequences. For \nexample, market discipline is reduced when a resolution process does not make management, \nshareholders and creditors bear the costs of their actions. \nThe third principle is equity of treatment. Regardless of an institution’s size, complexity \nor location, the resolution process must provide consistent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers. The pr ocess must be transparent and clearly stated \nso that everyone understands wh at to expect if they gamble  with the firm’s assets.  \nWhen talking about equity of treatment, it is important to recognize that a single process \ncan lead to different outcomes. For example, if any bank is examined and found to be insolvent, \nit needs to go through the resolu tion process with the owners lo sing their investment. However, \nthe eventual outcomes for the institution can be different. A smaller bank’s assets and deposits \nwill likely be sold to another bank. In the case of  a larger bank, the firm might be temporarily \noperated as a bridge bank before e ither being sold or reprivatized. Regardless, it is important that \nthe banks go through the same process or else an  incentive will be created for banks to take on \nexcessive risks in an effort to grow large enough to gain favorable treatment. \nA final principle is that we must base the resolution process on facts about what works \nand what does not work. One way to do this is to l ook at past financial crises . This is not the first \n\n9 \n financial crisis, and we can learn a lot about what  will and will not be successful by looking back \nat our own history with financial crises, as we ll as at the experiences in other countries.   \n \nIdentifying the Problem  \nWith these principles in mi nd, how should we go about resolving the current problems at \nour largest institutions?   \nFirst, we must determine both the location a nd size of the losses. Admittedly, it will not \nbe easy. These firms are very large – the four largest bank holding comp anies each have more \nthan  $1 trillion of assets, which accounts for about half of the banking industry’s assets. They have offices around the world, and they are involv ed in many complex businesses. But in order \nto repair the financial system, we must get the best estimates of the condition and viability of \nthese firms, and we must require them to reflect  their losses in their financial statements.   \nNormally, we think of a business’ solvency in  terms of the value of its equity capital.  \nWhen the value of its assets is less than the valu e of its liabilities, it has negative equity and it \nhas failed. A financial firm, however, can also fail if its liquidity is insufficient to meet its current \npayment obligations, either because it can’t sell its assets for enough to pay off maturing \nliabilities, or it loses market c onfidence and cannot borrow enough.   \nI would note that these are concrete definitio ns and not subjective conditions.  I mention \nthis because it points out that the term “too big to fail” is a misst atement. It does not matter what \nsize the firm is. Although a bank might still be open and operating, if it is insolvent by these \ndefinitions, it has failed.   \n\n10 \n Once we determine a bank’s status, we would classify these institutions into three \ncategories, depending on whether they are solvent and what their prospects are for continuing as \nan ongoing concern.  \nThe first category would be firms whose opera tions are strong and whose equity remains \nabove minimum requirements. These firms would not require much government support, if any.  \nSome might need to raise additional capital to pr ovide a greater cushion against the losses they \nmay suffer during the current crisis. But these inst itutions are basically sound and should be able \nto raise private capital. \nThe second category would be those instituti ons whose equity temporarily falls below \nminimum requirements but are expe cted to recover in a reasonabl e period of time as economic \nconditions improve. These firms have generally  sound management, who may have made some \nmistakes and suffered greater losses than norma l due to the economic dow nturn. It is reasonable \nto expect these banks to raise additional privat e capital. However, the government may need to \nprovide some capital in the form of preferred sh ares and possibly some warrants in return. As an \nequity holder, the government woul d have an oversight role rega rding the firms’ operations and \nactivities. \nThe final category is for the institutions th at are no longer viable either because of \nliquidity problems or their equity capital is curren tly negative or it is like ly to become negative, \nbased on reasonable expectations of future market and economic conditions. These firms, which would likely soon become equity insolvent wi thout government protections and guarantees, \nwould be declared insolvent by th e regulatory authority. Shareholde rs would be forced to bear \nthe full cost of the positions they have taken a nd risk losing their invest ment. Senior management \nand the board of directors would be replaced becaus e they are responsible fo r the failed strategy.   \n\n11 \n  \nA Resolution Process \nThe question then becomes how to resolve th ese failed institutions while minimizing the \ncost and disruption to the economy.  \nThe method most often used when a bank fails is to arrange for a sale of its assets and an \nassumption of its liabilities by another institutio n. For these extremely large firms, there are a \ncouple of significant roadblocks pr eventing this solution. First, th e acquiring firm must have the \ncapacity for the acquisition, which m eans it would have to be in the same size range as the failed \ninstitution. And secondly, if such a deal was forg ed, it would create an ev en larger firm with \ngreater systemic risks to the economy.   \nInstead, an extremely large firm that has faile d would have to be temporarily operated as \na conservatorship or a bridge or ganization and then reprivatized as quickly as is economically \nfeasible. We cannot simply add more capital w ithout a change in the firm’s ownership and \nmanagement and expect different outcomes in the future. \nExperience shows that this approach has wo rked. The best example was with the failure \nof Continental Illinois National Bank and its  holding company in 1984. Because we are in \nOklahoma today, I will note that Continental’s pr oblems began with some bad loans it purchased \nfrom Oklahoma City’s Penn Square Bank. As an o fficer in our Bank’s regul atory function at that \ntime, I was directly involved in the closi ng of Penn Square. In fact, from 1982 to 1992, 347 \nbanks failed or received FDIC assistance in th e Tenth Federal Reserve District states. I was \ninvolved in almost every one of these resolutions and all were tr agedies. I tell you this to make \nclear that I do not take this proposal lightly nor do I expect any size bank failure to be easy or \n\n12 \n painless. But the process that worked for Continen tal Illinois is a viable approach to addressing \nimportant aspects of today’s crisis. \nAt the time of its failure, Continental Illinois had $40 bill ion in assets and was the \nnation’s largest commercial and industrial lender. It was the seventh- la rgest bank in the United \nStates.  It had 57 offices in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a large network of domestic and \ninternational correspondent rela tionships, and a separate function for making residential and \ncommercial real estate loans. It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.   \nWhen Continental failed, its top manageme nt and directors were replaced with \nindividuals who had experien ce operating large, complex or ganizations. John Swearingen, \nformer chairman of Standard Oil of Indian a, became CEO of the hol ding company, and William \nOgden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, became CEO. \nThe FDIC committed to taking a book value of $4.5 billion of bad assets off of \nContinental’s balance sheet and pl aced them in a separate work- out unit to recover as much of \nthe value of the assets as possible. Among those ba d assets, $1 billion was written off as a loss at \nthe time of the transaction. \nTo offset the $1 billion loss to Continenta l’s capital, the FDIC provided $1 billion in \ncapital in exchange for preferred stock, of which $720 million was convertible to common stock \nupon sale. When converted, the $720 million would amount to a 79.9 percent ownership stake in \nContinental.   \nThe FDIC also received five-year warrants  to purchase the remaining common stock for \nfar below one cent per share ($0.00001).  If at the end of five years,  the cost of the resolution was \nmore than $800 million, the FDIC would exercise  100 percent of the warr ants; if losses were \nlower, the amount of warrants exercised would be  in proportion to the amount of the losses.   \n\n13 \n To economize on FDIC staff and to provide ad ditional expertise, the loan liquidation unit \nwas staffed by a combination of FDIC personnel,  hired specialists and Continental employees \nunder incentive contracts. \nContinental Illinois was fully reprivatized by 1991 and eventually purchased by Bank of \nAmerica in 1994. The FDIC exercised all of the wa rrants so the shareholders in Continental’s \nholding company effectively lost their entire inve stment. The FDIC sold all of the preferred \nshares and shares from exercising the warrant s for $1.2 billion, which was a net gain of $200 \nmillion. The FDIC also earned $200 million in divi dends. The ultimate resolution cost to the \nFDIC was $1.1 billion, which was 3.28 percent of Continental’s assets  at the time of resolution. \nThere has been much talk lately about a new resolution process for systemically \nimportant firms that Congress could enact, and I would encourage this be implemented as \nquickly as possible, but we do not have to wait  for new authority. We can act immediately, using \nessentially the same steps we used for Continental.  \nStock could be issued and control assumed by a government entity. A bridge institution \ncould be created within the inst itution so essential services an d operations would continue as \nnormal. Where necessary, the government would provi de capital in exchange for preferred shares \nconvertible to common stock upon sale. Existing shareholders would provide the government \nwarrants to purchase all outstanding shares wi th the amount exercised determined by the \ngovernment’s resolution cost. Senior manage ment and directors would be replaced.  \nThe most difficult part of re solving these large firms without  a new resolution process is \nhow to make creditors bear the cost of their positions. Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing \nobligations would be addressed and dealt with  according to the cove nants and contractual \npriorities set up for each type of debt. Insure d creditors would have immediate access to their \n\n14 \n funds, while other creditors would have immediat e access to maturing funds  with the potential \nfor haircuts, depending on exp ected recoveries, any collatera l protection and likely market \nimpact. However, this is difficu lt because it would require negotia ting with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulatory authorities to declare a nonbank financial firm \ninsolvent. \n Regardless of how the firm is resolved, short- term liabilities in par ticular would need to \nbe addressed immediately because of their impor tance in meeting the creditors’ daily payment \nobligations and operational needs.  Quick decisi ons should also be made on all counterparty \narrangements because of the widespread impact that uncertainty would have on the counterparties.   \nAuthorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, whether the losses \nassociated with this outcome would lead to a lo ss of confidence in financial markets and serious \nfunding problems that would threaten the viabilit y of other financial firms. If so, it may be \nnecessary to honor all co unterparty arrangements and/or short- term liabilities, as we did with \nContinental Illinois.   \nHowever, this guarantee must be considered as an exception to the normal process.  \nCongress would have to enact an approval process similar to the sy stemic exception for banks as \nspecified in the 1991 FDIC Improvement Act, re quiring approval by two-th irds of the Federal \nReserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the president.   \nAs much as I dislike extending government  guarantees and thereby reducing market \ndiscipline, if we were to implement this excep tion, I believe we would also need to extend the \n\n15 \n same guarantees to all other institutions or we would give failed institutions a competitive \nadvantage.   \nAnother key part of the resolution is that the bad assets need to be taken off the balance \nsheet of the failed institution at realistic mark et values and placed in an asset management \ncompany, resulting in two entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”  Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the receiver could take the bad assets and work them out.  \nAfter writing off the bad assets, the governme nt would provide the “good bank” with enough \ncapital so that it can become a profitable ongoing concern and at tractive to private investors for \nreprivatization. Any recoveries from the bad bank  would first go toward paying off the costs of \nthe government, and any proceeds left over would be  distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \nThe separation of the bad assets is cr itical. When a bank has a large share of \nnonperforming assets, they remain a burden when they  are left on the balance sheet, even if they \nare written down appropriately. For example, they must be funded although they are not \nproducing income. Such a circumstance creates un certainty about the bank ’s financial condition \nand diverts management’s attention from the business objectives necessary for recovery. The \nfocus of the “good bank” must be on the fu ture, gaining new customers and expanding \noperations, while the goal of the “bad bank” mu st be on getting rid of customers and winding \ndown the operations.      \nAs part of the reprivatization process, it is also important to  determine the advisability of \nbreaking up or selling off operati ons and independent subsidiaries  where possible, especially \ngiven the market discipline problems we have en countered with institutions  regarded as “too big \nto fail.” Moreover, assessing the condition and vi ability of large, complex financial firms is \n\n16 \n difficult, and the failure of such a firm may be an indication that it is also too large and complex \nto manage well. We should avoid setting conditions that only repeat past mistakes in creating too \nbig and too complex an institution. \nThis system is clearly more equitable than what we have seen so far.  At the start of the TARP I program, $125 b illion was provided to  the nine largest \nfinancial firms without an in-d epth, thorough exam of their cond ition.  However, all other banks \nreceived TARP funds only if their primary regulator conclude d they were strong enough to \nweather the crisis and conti nue as an ongoing concern.   \nThe $10 per share that Bear Stearns’ stockhol ders received from the JPMorgan Chase \nacquisition would not have been possible withou t the government’s guarantee of $29 billion of \nproblem assets. Additionally, the governme nt has committed $173 billion to support AIG’s \ncontinued operations, with their shareholders st anding to reap financial gain if AIG ultimately \nrecovers.  \nMeanwhile, 46 banks in the United States ha ve failed since the be ginning of 2008. All of \nthem were resolved through one of the bank reso lution problems I have discussed here today.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \nIt is understandable that there are concerns about letting these large firms fail, but it \nshould be noted that the program I have just described has a record of success elsewhere. \nThe economic situation in Sweden in the earl y 1990s was similar to that in the United \nStates today. Its financial sy stem was dominated by six larg e banks that accounted for 90 \npercent of the industry’s assets. Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major \nfinancial institutions. The viable Swedish ba nks were soon recapitalized, largely through \n\n17 \n private sources, and public authorities quickly took over two large insolv ent banks and spun off \ntheir bad assets to be managed within a separa te entity. Sweden was able to systematically \nrestore confidence in its financ ial system, and although it took se veral years to work down and \nsell off all of the bad assets, there was minimal net cost to the taxpayers.   \nSome argue that the Swedish situation is not a valid comparison because it only dealt \nwith only six banks. In addition, some argue th at the Swedish system was much less complex, \nand that the Swedish government had to work out primarily commercial real estate loans instead \nof the complex financial assets, st ructured securities and derivatives  that we would have to work \nout today.    \nThese are valid concerns, but I would point out, first, that although the United States has \nseveral thousand banks, only 19 have more than $100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory \nauthorities evaluate their condition, it is lik ely that few would requi re further government \nintervention. Second, as for complexity, I would point out that real es tate assets involve \nconsiderable complexity, no less so than many financial derivatives. \nAnother important example is the Reconstruc tion Finance Corporation (RFC), which was \nused to deal with banking problems in the United States in the 1930s. The RFC followed a \nprocess very similar to what I have described. It began by examining pr oblem banks and writing \ndown the bad assets to realistic economic values , making any needed and appropriate changes in \nbank management, injecting public equity as needed  into these banks, and returning the banks to \nprivate ownership. The RFC proved to be high ly successful in recapitalizing banks, and like \nSweden, there was essentially no net cost to ta xpayers. More detailed information on both the \nContinental Illinois and Swedish models for large bank resolution will be posted today with a \ntext of my remarks on our Bank’s website at Ka nsasCityFed.org. Absent a detailed explanation \n\n18 \n of why this approach can’t be done, it is my hope that it will be useful to  provide more details \naround my view that it can be done. \nLet me make two final points.   First, the debate over the resolution of the la rgest financial firms is  often sensationalized \nbecause it is framed in terms of nationalizing fa iled institutions. It is also pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \nIn response, I would note that no firm w ould be nationalized in this program.  \nNationalization is the process of  the government taking over a going concern with the intent of \noperating it. Though a bridge instit ution is the most likely outcom e when a large financial firm \nfails, the goal is for the firm to  be reprivatized as quickly as possible. In addition, subject to \nregulatory agency oversight, the bridge firm would be managed by private sector managers \nselected for their experience in operating we ll-run, large, complex organizations.    \nThe second point is related to the complexity is sue, which is that it would be hard to find \nenough people with the required knowledge, experi ence and skills to fill the open positions.  \nGoing back to the Continental Illinois example, we  were able to do it then. More generally: The \nUnited States is a vast country with a treme ndous amount of management resources in a broad-\nbased economic and industrial system. If the United States does not have th e talent to run these \nfirms, then we are much worse off than I thought. I refuse to accept that conclusion. \n  \n\n19 \n  \n \n \nMATERIALS REFERENCED  IN THE SPEECH: \n \nSUCCESS DEPENDS ON FAILURE \n \n \n  \n• A Resolution Process for Financial Firms \n \n• Assistance for Continental Illinois \n \n• Swedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• References \n \n    \n \n \n \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n        \nTulsa Metro Chamber of Commerce \nTulsa, Oklahoma \nApril 9, 2009 \n  \n \n\n20 \n A Resolution Process for Financial Firms \n \n• The United States is in the middle of a seri ous financial crisis, and the economy is under \nsignificant stress. While there has been a lot of  debate about how to revive the economy and \nrestore financial stability, there is broad ag reement that the economy will not recover until \nthe financial system is stabilized a nd credit starts flowing more normally. \n \n• The recovery of the financial system depends  critically on the public  regaining trust and \nconfidence in financial institutions, particularly the largest financial in stitutions. The public’s \nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken, \nthe poor management of those risks and the resu lting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal \nfinancial market activity depends importantly  on how the problems of the largest bank and \nnonbank financial instituti ons are addressed.   \n \n• Despite the best of intentions, the policies and ac tions directed at restor ing the health of the \nfinancial system have not been c onsistent or transparent. It is  understandable that the initial \nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because  the depth and breadth of the problems were \nnot expected and there were no plans in  place for addressing the problems.   \n \n• The solution must be a clear and fair plan so  that financial firms, investors and consumers \nknow what to expect when any financial institu tion runs into problems. Specifically, the plan \nmust provide a process for how policymakers will  address the deterioration of the financial \ncondition of all financial firms,  regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become \ninsolvent.    \n• A resolution process is part icularly important for the largest, most complex and \ninterconnected institutions because they have be en considered by many as “too big to fail,” at \nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution pro cess that can be used for any \nfinancial firm involved in the intermediation pr ocess or payments system, but the focus is on \nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too big to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the be st solution for the economy.   \n \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework \n \n• A free market system requires that business ow ners capture the profits from their successes \nand bear the costs of their failures. Firms that me et the market test will grow, while those that \ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowe d to go out of business if they fail. The \nconsequences of failure and the resolution fram ework must be clearly stated and transparent \nso that business owners have cl ear expectations about the cons equences of their actions.   \n \n• The resolution framework must pr escribe a predefined set of ru les, guided by an agreed upon \nset of principles. This is particularly important  for financial institutions, big or small, because \ntheir success depends critically  on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable, \nongoing concern.  \n \n  \n\n21 \n • There are two key principles that the resolution process should follow. \n \n• First, the resolution process should minimi ze the cost to the overall economy.   \n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant \nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems. \n- The process should minimize the cost of reso lving an insolvency to avoid a long-term \nfiscal burden on taxpayers.  \n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and \nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.  \n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, su ch as the government bearing some of the \nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.   \n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly \nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.   \n- To minimize the future cost to the econom y, the resolution process must not create \nadverse incentives that are inconsistent w ith economic efficiency.  Specifically, the \nresolution process must not allow a firm’s management, shareholders and creditors to \navoid the consequences of their mistakes b ecause it reduces market discipline, creates \nadverse incentives for firms to take too much  risk, and inefficientl y directs resources and \nfinancial capital to less-productive uses. \n- The process must be transparen t and clearly stated so that  everyone understands what to \nexpect and the consequences of their actio ns. Management must know beforehand what \nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant, \nnegative effect on the firm ’s financial condition. \n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution pr ocess should be based on solid research and \ninformation about what works and what doe s not work. Policymakers can learn a lot \nabout what will and will not be  successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial \ncrises, as well as at cris es in other countries.   \n \n• The second principle is the resolu tion process must be equitable in  that it is the same for all \nfinancial firms regardless of size or locati on, although it is possible that the outcome will \ndiffer.  \n-  The resolution process must provide cons istent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers,  regardless of the institution’s size, \ncomplexity or location.   \n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the differe nce between process \nand outcome.   \n- For example, if a bank is examined and f ound to be insolvent, the bank should go through \nthe resolution process and the owners shoul d lose their investment regardless of the \nbank’s size.  The outcome may be that a rela tively small bank is resolved by another \ninstitution purchasing its assets  and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is \ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank. \n- In both cases, the banks go through the same pr ocess of being declared insolvent and the \nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.   \n- Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risk s just to grow to a size large enough to \nreceive favorable treatment, and customers ma y choose to go with a large bank instead of \na small bank. \n\n22 \n  \nOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution  \n \n• There are several options for resolving a faile d firm, but it is important to first define \ninsolvency. \n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its co mmon equity capital is negative – that is, the \nfirm’s outstanding liabilities owed  to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets. \n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a posi tive amount of equity capital, is not viable \nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to  meet its current payment obligations, either \nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to  pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses \nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.   \n- It is important to note that these are defi nitions of insolvency and are not subjective \nconditions, which points out that the term “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It \ndoes not matter what size a firm is – if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.  \n• The question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?   \n \n• One option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to main tain ongoing operations \nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment \nobligations.   - In this case, nothing is actual ly resolved, and the insolvent firm is essentially bailed out \nso that it can continue normal operations.  \n- This option may be used for a large financial firm that is consider ed “too big to fail” \nbecause of concerns that it is  systemically important, in th e sense that other resolution \nmethods would have large, negati ve spillover effects on economy.   \n- Under this option, the term “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve” \nbecause of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and \nfinancial system. \n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; curren t shareholders do not \nlose their investment, alt hough the government may impose some restrictions on the \nfirm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses. \n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of th e first principle of minimizing costs.   \n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not \nimmediately cause further problems, it sets th e stage for significant future problems. In a \nbailout, senior management, directors and curr ent shareholders stand to reap any gains \nthat may result, which weakens market discip line and creates the moral hazard that the \nfirm will take too much risk.   \n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and \nnot for smaller firms that are not expected to  cause spillover effect s if other resolution \nmethods are used. \n \n•\n Alternatively, bank regulators have for years us ed a variety of options to resolve insolvent \nbanks. These options include: - liquidation,  \n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s asse ts and assumption of its  liabilities by another \ninstitution,  \n\n23 \n - or operating the bank for a short period of  time through open-bank assistance or as a \nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of \nprivate investors. \n \n• When most people think of a firm as failing, th ey generally think the firm is shut down and \nliquidated.   \n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed  as a receiver and it pays off insured \ndepositors up to the deposit insurance limit. \n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid pa rtial amounts based on expected recoveries. \n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets  by selling them or holding on to them and \nworking them out. The proceeds from the asse ts are used to first pay remaining amounts \nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecure d creditors, and if a nything is left over, \nto shareholders.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they \nmay have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts. \n- While liquidation strongly enforces market di scipline and does not promote moral hazard, \nit tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and \ntherefore is the least desirable choice.   \n- This option is disruptive for individuals and business custom ers because they tend to hold \nshort-term instruments, such as deposits a nd commercial paper, for making payments or \nas a temporary way of storing their f unds. Many business customers also have \ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when \nthe bank is liquidated. \n \n• The resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumpti on (P&A) transaction, \nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another ba nk to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and \nassume its liabilities.   - In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution \nmethod because the FDIC may receive a prem ium from the acquiring bank. And even if \nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assu me the liabilities, it is often less costly \nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquida te the failed bank’s \nassets. \n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy. \n- Short-term creditors and count erparties have immediate acces s to all insured deposits and \nat least a large portion of uninsured obligati ons, while borrowers continue to have access \nto credit.   \n- In addition, because management and director s are replaced and shareholders lose their \ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not re duce market discipline or create adverse \nincentives for bank management and shareholders.    \n• While a P&A transaction is often the best optio n for most failed banks, it generally is not the \nbest option if one of the largest financial inst itutions fails because it creates even larger \ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.   - A major difficulty in the current financial cr isis has been that some institutions are so \nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no \nmatter what option is used.   \n\n24 \n - Only another institution in the same size range  would have the capacity and resources to \npurchase the assets and assume the liabil ities of another large institution.   \n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been se veral examples of large institutions taking \nover other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if in stitutions can get “too \nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, th e resolution process shoul d not result in even \nlarger institutions.  \n• The final option, which is the most feasible fo r a large, complex financial institution that \nfails, is to run it temporarily as a cons ervatorship or bri dge organization.   \n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy. \n- This option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to \nconduct the necessary due diligence. \n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible. \n- As will be discussed below, management, shar eholders and creditors would be forced to \nbear the full cost of their actions and positio ns they have taken to maintain market \ndiscipline and economic efficiency.   \n \n• One of the difficulties with all of these options  is that while there are time-tested, fast \nresolution processes in place for depository inst itutions, today’s largest financial institutions \nare conglomerate financial holdi ng companies with many financia l subsidiaries that are not \nbanks.   - The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option \nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bank ruptcy process.   \n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete – sometimes years – which \nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it  can continue normal operations while in \nbankruptcy.   \n- It does not work for financial firms, however , because they have a variety of complex, \nshort-term liabilities and counterparty a rrangements that customers depend on for \nmaintaining daily operations.  A long, draw n-out bankruptcy pro ceeding would prevent \ncustomers and counterparties from having access to their funds, which would cause \nsignificant economic disruptions. \n- In addition, the cornerstone of  a financial institution’s fran chise value is trust in its \nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sure to quickly erode in a long, drawn-\nout bankruptcy proceeding.   \n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding comp anies quickly and in a way that minimizes \nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a \nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.   \n \n• \nEnacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the \nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and shoul d act immediately to \nresolve a large financial company should one fail. \n \n    \n\n25 \n A Proposed Resolution Process \n \n• The resolution process discussed below is applicable  to any financial firm that is part of the \nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the \nfocus is on systemically important financial in stitutions that are f ound to be insolvent. \n \n• To prevent systemic disruptions to the econom y, a failed institution should be allowed to \ncontinue its operations through a bridge instituti on or conservatorship so  that all essential \nservices and operations would go on as normal.   - Because the firm is insolvent, it would need  additional capital to continue operating.   \n- To recapitalize the firm, the government c ould provide the capital in exchange for \npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.   \n \n• In general, the supervisory authorities would not  have the authority to declare the institution \ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management a nd shareholders bear the costs of their actions \nand investment decisions, the government ’s investment would be conditional on: \n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure. \n- Existing shareholders providing the governme nt warrants to purchase all outstanding \nshares, with the amount exercised determined  by the net costs of resolving the firm. \n- While shareholders may be reluctant to agre e to these conditions, in most cases, they \nwould have little choice give n the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance. \n \n• The specific steps to be taken would depend on seve ral factors, such as the type of financial \norganization and the supervisor’s  existing legal authority.   \n For example, if a holding company’s primar y asset is an insured bank and the bank and \nholding company become insolvent, the bank co uld be closed and the FDIC could set up \na bridge bank.   \n In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervis ory authorities could \ntake actions to mitigate the imp act on the rest of the economy.  \n \n• The most difficult part of reso lving these large firms without a new resolution process is how \nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.   \n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing oblig ations would be addressed and dealt with \naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.   \n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would \nhave immediate access to matu ring funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on \nexpected recoveries, any collateral pr otection and likely market impact.   \n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulator y authorities to decl are a nonbank financial \nfirm insolvent. \n \n• Regardless of how the firm is re solved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors \nwill be treated. \n- Short-term liabilities in partic ular would need to be addressed immediately because of \ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’  daily payment obligations and operations \nneeds.   \n\n26 \n - Quick decisions also need to be made on a ll counterparty arrangements because of the \nwidespread impact that uncerta inty about their status or default would have on their \ncounterparties.   \n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of  their decisions and market discipline is \nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in \nline behind more senior cred itors as the claims on the bank are resolved.   \n- However, the authorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, \nwhether the losses associated w ith this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in \nfinancial markets and serious funding problems th at would threaten th e viability of other \nfinancial firms.  \n \n• In a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short-\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prev ent a systemic disruption to the \neconomy.   - However, this guarantee should be considered  as a “systemic” exception to the normal \nprocess.   \n- To limit the use of this exception to truly sy stemic situations, C ongress should enact an \napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991 \nFDIC Improvement Act.   \n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds \nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Tr easury, in consultation w ith the president.  \n- In addition, though the extension of government  guarantees and the re sulting reduction in \nmarket discipline should generally be avoi ded, extension of the same guarantees would \nneed to be made to every other institution. Otherwise, failed instit utions would have a \ncompetitive advantage over sound institutions, which clearly violates the principle of \nequitable treatment.   \n \n• Another key part of the resoluti on is the bad assets need to be  taken off the balance sheet of \nthe failed institution at realistic market values.   \n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting \nin two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”   \n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the r eceiver could take the bad assets and work \nthem out.   \n- After writing off the bad assets, the gove rnment would provide the good bank with \nenough capital so that it can become a pr ofitable ongoing concern and attractive to \nprivate investors for even tual reprivatization.   \n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would firs t go toward paying off the costs of the \ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \n \n• The separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forwar d-looking process for recovery \nand the eventual reprivat ization of the good bank.   \n- When a bank has a large share of nonperforming  assets, they remain a burden when they \nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.   \n- For example, they still have to be funde d even though they are not producing income, \nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s fi nancial condition, and they divert a lot of \n\n27 \n management’s attention from more productiv e activities for the future growth and \nprofitability of the bank.   \n- In addition, the business objectiv es and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and \nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills for running an ongoing financial firm.   \n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand \noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is  to get rid of customers and wind down the \noperations.      \n \n• As part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory author ities should consider breaking up \nor selling off operations and indepe ndent subsidiaries where possible. \n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market \ndiscipline problems.   \n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication th at it is too large and \ncomplex to manage well.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \n \n• A variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest fina ncial firms fail. These \nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However, \nthe resolution process being advocated he re has a record of success elsewhere.  \n \n• First, the proposed resolution pr ocess is exactly what the Swed es did to solve an equally \nsevere banking crisis that they had in the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to \n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed descri ption of the Swedish crisis and resolution \nprocess).   \n The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was \ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.   \n Sweden took decisive steps to identify lo sses in its major financial institutions.   \n The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and \npublic authorities quickly t ook over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad \nassets to be managed within  a separate entity.    \n Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its fina ncial system, and although it took \nseveral years to work down and sell off all of  the bad assets, there was essentially no net \ncost to the taxpayers.   \n Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were \nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors \nand other unsecured creditors.   \n \n• Some people do not think that the Swedish situ ation is a valid comparison because it dealt \nwith only six banks.  In addition, some argue  that the Swedish system was much less \ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans, \nnot the complex financial assets, such as stru ctured securities and de rivatives, that would \nhave to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail.  While these concerns are valid, it shou ld be noted that:   \n\n28 \n - Although the United States has several thous and banks, only 19 banks have more than \n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is \nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.   \n- It is actually very difficult to work out pr oblems on real estate assets, and it is not \nnecessarily more difficult to work  out even complex securities.  \n \n• As an aside, an additional lesson that can be le arned from Sweden is th at a resolution process \nis much more likely to succeed if it has broa d political support and is structured to be \nindependent of the political process.   o The plan should be put largely under the c ontrol of independent supervisory agencies. \no Political involvement should be confined la rgely to specifying the program’s goals and \nbasic rules.   \no The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the \nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces  the need for political involvement. \n \n• A second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstructi on Finance Corporation \n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems  in the United States in the 1930s.   \n- The RFC began by examining problem banks a nd writing down the bad assets to realistic \neconomic values. \n- It then made any needed and appropriate  changes in bank management and provided \npublic equity capital as needed. \n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its \ncosts.  \n• A final example is the failure of Continenta l Illinois National Bank a nd its holding company \nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution \nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed pr ocess.  In addition, it is an \nexample of a resolution of  a large, complex, interconnected holding company. \n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial a nd industrial lender and the \nseventh- largest U.S. bank.  It had 57 offi ces in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a \nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent re lationships, and a separate \nfunction for making residential and commercial  real estate loans.  It also provided \nspecialized services to a variety of companies.   \n- The attached document, “Assistance for Con tinental Illinois,” provides details about the \nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company. \n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the \nholding company shareholders lo st their entire investment, and the bank was restored to \nsound condition and returned  to private ownership. \n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns \nabout the systemic consequences of impos ing losses on uninsured depositors and other \nunsecured creditors.    \n• Another concern that has been ra ised about letting the largest fi nancial firms fail is that it \nnationalizes these institutions.  As  part of this concern, it is  also often pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \n In the proposed process, no firm  would be nationalized.   \n\n29 \n  Nationalization is the proce ss of the government taking ove r a going concern with the \nintent of continued ownership.   \n Though a bridge institution is the most likely ou tcome for a large financial firm that fails, \nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized  as quickly as possible, subject to the \ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.   \n In addition, subject to regulatory agency overs ight, the bridge firm would be managed by \nprivate sector managers selected for th eir experience in operating well-run, large, \ncomplex organizations.    \n \n• Some opponents to the proposed process also cl aim it would be very difficult to take over \nthese firms and bring in new management becau se they are too complex to manage, as well \nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, a nd skills to fill the \nopen positions.   o The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with \nexperience running large, complex organizations.   \no In addition, while the institution might be co mplex, a new management team is clearly \nbetter than leaving the institution under the c ontrol of the management team that caused it \nto fail in the first place.   \no More generally, it is hard to believe that th ere is not enough talent, either from the United \nStates or other countries, to run these organizations. \n                        \n \n \n\n30 \n Assistance for Continental Illinois \n \nI. Problems at Continental Illinois \n \n• In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continen tal Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid \ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lendi ng, that was largely funded \nby purchased money. \n• It became the seventh-largest U.S. bank a nd largest commercial lender in the United \nStates. \n• Penn Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy \nmarkets led to declining asset quality a nd earnings at Continental from 1982 into \n1984 and forced Continental to rely heav ily on foreign money markets for funding. \n• News stories in May 1984 on Continenta l’s problems started a run by foreign \ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, th ey had withdrawn more than $6 billion. \n• The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago be gan lending through the discount window to \ncover the lost deposits, and Continenta l put together a $4.5 billion loan package \nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.  \n \nII.  Interim Financial Assistance \n \n• On May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Fede ral Reserve announced an interim \nassistance package for Continental, wh ich was based on the FDIC’s open bank \nassistance authority. \n• The FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at  Continental in order to keep a liquidity \ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks , prevent significant lo sses at the many banks \nthat had correspondent accounts at Continen tal and avoid other negative effects in \nU.S. financial markets. \n• A $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest-\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FD IC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining \n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks. \n• The Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liq uidity needs of Con tinental, and a group \nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to pr ovide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an \nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed. \n• The FDIC was unable to find any merger part ners for Continental during this interim \nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s a sset problems, substa ntial litigation and \nfunding issues, along with the limited numb er of merger partners under Illinois’ \ninterstate banking restrictions.      \nIII. Permanent Financial Assistance \n \n- In July 1984, a permanent assistance pl an was put in place for Continental. \n\n31 \n - Continental’s top management and board  of directors were removed.  John \nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding \ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice  chairman of Chase Manhattan, became \nCEO of the bank. \n- The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Contin ental’s discount window borrowings from \nthe Federal Reserve. \n- In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book \nvalue) of assets from Continental.  Th is consisted of poor quality loans that \nContinental had already written  down to $3 billion (these loans were further written \ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and C ontinental was forced to take a charge of \n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continenta l for $1.5 billion, which \nContinental could repay within three year s by giving the FDIC additional loans of \nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion. \n- To offset the $1 billion charge to Continen tal’s capital that was required by the loan \nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capita l into Continental. The FDIC’s capital \ninfusion consisted of $720 million of pe rmanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior \nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9 \npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of \npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative pr eferred stock in the holding company. This \nassistance was provided through the holding co mpany rather than the bank because \ncovenants in the holding company’s debt in struments required debtholder approval to \nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it. \n- The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it fo r any losses, carrying \ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired. \n- The $2 billion in subordinated notes issu ed under the interim plan was repaid. \n- To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation \ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel,  Continental employees under incentive \ncontracts and hired specialists. \n     \nIV. Return to Private Ownership and the Co st of Resolving Continental Illinois \n \n- In a series of sales that took place be tween December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC \nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option. \n- The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their en tire investment once \nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as  compensation for loan liquidation losses.  \n- From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private \nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital \ninvestment, and it also received more than  $200 million in dividends on this stock. \n- Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from  Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion, \nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continenta l’s assets at the ti me of resolution. \n- Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.   \n\n32 \n  \nSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• Economic and financial market conditions lead ing up to the Swedish banking crisis were \nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis. \n- Deregulation of financial markets (eliminati on of quantitative controls on bank lending, \nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on cap ital flows) is similar to recent deregulation \n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial i nnovations (securitization, derivatives). \n- Large inflow of foreign capital and e xpansion of domestic  lending and debt. \n- Low/negative real interest rates. \n- Strong growth in consumption and real es tate investment and low savings rate. \n- Sharp increases in asset prices  (stocks and real estate). \n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real \ninterest rates, the impact on the economy  was similar to the current crisis.  \n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (t angible asset values fell about 30 percent). \n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankrupt cies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and \n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively). \n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from  being slightly negative at the end of the \n1980s to 8 percent in 1993. \n- Residential real estate  investment froze.  \n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan – temporary government investment in banks \nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically \nfeasible.  \n• Political support – th e program had broad political support, which was important for quick \ndecisive actions and providing the nationa l leadership necessary for public support. \n• Political independence – a Bank Support Authorit y, separate from the financial supervisory \nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the \nprogram.  The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from \npolitical interference in ma king decisions, although the BS A worked closely with the \nsupervisory authority  and central bank. \n• Debt guarantees \n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other cr editors were fully protected from future \nlosses, including foreign creditors (account ed for about 40 percent of bank funding). \n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis  ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed \ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the \ncrisis). \n• Transparency  \n- The government was very open about the process. \n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and \nrealistic asset values, and asset values that  had declined were promptly written down. \n• Bank recapitalization  \n- A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject \nto various economic scenarios.  Banks were plac ed in one of three categories based on their \nviability in the worst-case scenario, which de termined the type of government support they \nwould receive. \n- Category 1 – Capital deteriorates but re mains above minimum requirements.   \n\n33 \n The bank was expected to raise additional cap ital, with temporary government guarantees \navailable if necessary to help  maintain public confidence. \n- Category 2 – Capital falls below minimum require ments but is expected to rise above the \nminimum in a reasonable period of time. \nShareholders were expected  to contribute additional capital, with the government \ncontributing capital as necessary to meet ope rating requirements.  Government received \npreferred shares. \n- Category 3 – Capital becomes negative and ba nk is unlikely to become profitable. \nBank declared insolvent and gove rnment resolves the bank in the least-costly manner, \nincluding the possibility  of liquidation.   \n• Good bank, bad bank model – used for banks that received government support and for \ninsolvent banks.  Nonperforming loans were tran sferred to work-out companies at realistic \nmarket values.  The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound operations and managed by financial market pr ofessionals with clea r business objectives. \n• Shareholders were not protected (except fo r one bank in which the government was the \nmajority shareholder, as noted below).  \n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares. \n- The government also received vo ting power that would grow over time, so the government \nwould eventually become the majority shar eholder if the suppor t was large enough and \nmaintained for a long period of time. \n• Banks that received assistance were given c onditions to make operational improvements. \nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance. \n• Results \n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Categ ory 2) received govern ment capital (the \ngovernment was already the majority sharehol der and it also purcha sed the outstanding \nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and \neventually merged with Nordbanken; a nd Sparbanken received a government loan. \n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely \nintact – there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.  \n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent \nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke ev en, which is based on \ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale \nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proc eeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross \nfiscal cost of the support program is estimat ed to have been about 4 percent of GDP.  \n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized a nd is now part of Nordea (the government \nowns about 20 percent), which operates in  Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. \n• Lessons learned \n- Political consensus on a s upport plan is crucial. \n- Once the plan is formed and implemented, it is  just as important for the process to be \nindependent of political interference and fully tr ansparent to the public. \n- The government officials in charge of the pr ogram must take timely and decisive actions \nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political indepe ndence is important. \n- Assets must be given realistic valuations. \n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose thei r investment, and senior management and the \nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes.  Markets will \nnot be efficient unless those w ho may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs \n\n34 \n when those actions lead to losses, and equita ble treatment requires that the same rules \napply to all firms regardless of size. \n- The program’s success also requires that th e new management of the good and bad banks \nare financial industry professionals, are gi ven sound business obj ectives and clearly \nunderstand to whom they are responsible,  which is another reason why political \nindependence is important. \n                    \n \n                   \n\n35 \n REFERENCES \n \n Davison, Lee. “Continental Illi nois and ‘Too Big to Fail,’” History of the Eighties, Lessons for \nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of th e 1980s and Early 1990s , Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n       \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Co mmunity Affairs Research Conference \nWashington, DC \nApril 17, 2009 \n \n \n   \n  \n\n2 \n   \n \nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Ka nsas City, along with our  planning partners at \nthe Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Sa n Francisco, and the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors, I would like to welcome you to the second day of this conference and thank you for \nyour participation.  \nAlthough the topics to be disc ussed here are always of extreme importance, the current \nenvironment gives our discussion added urgency. Though we are all being affected by the turmoil \nin our economy, the underserved are especially vu lnerable. Their safety net may be extremely \nlimited, if it exists at all. M eanwhile, they are often the firs t to suffer during an economic \ndownturn and the last  to recover.  \nAs you all know, there are many reasons why it is  important that consumers have access to \nfinancial products and the knowledge to use them  safely. In addition to what it does for the \nindividual or family, it is also important for the nation’s collective well-being that consumers at all \nlevels are able to make wise decisions with their finances in a manner that best suits their needs.  \nWith this in mind, the regional Federal Re serve Banks have taken a number of steps \nfocused on these issues within the communities they  serve. It is well-known that the 12 Reserve \nBanks, along with their branches, play an importa nt role in giving the Federal Reserve a truly \nnational perspective on issues related to mone tary policy and banking. But they also conduct \nimportant research to help the Federal Reserve and others understand th e underlying issues for \nthose with low incomes and those who are unders erved in the area of financial services. In \nDecember of 2007, the Fed convened staff from its research, supervision and community affairs \nareas to identify the state of know ledge concerning mortgage market s in the current environment. \nThis effort identified knowledge gaps to be addr essed through research and outlined strategies to \nhelp individuals and communities respond to the financial crisis.  \n\n3 \n  We have integrated the research with public  programs where our re gional Reserve Banks \nare taking on an increasingly prominent role. Where once our public programs were focused \nprimarily on providing information to broad groups  of constituencies, we are now engaged largely \nin technical and capacity building ef forts with defined stakeholders. \nThroughout the System, each Bank has developed unique programs to meet the identified \nneeds within its District, and by doing so  has strengthened the learning, innovation and \neffectiveness of the System’s overall response. Th is is one of the real strengths of our System. \nBecause the Reserve Banks are regional institutions , we are able to foster local partnerships and \noffer local expertise to the commun ities of our respective Districts.  \nAlthough these programs are create d at the individual Bank level to serve a local need, in \nalmost all instances they provide a template th at can be, and often is, replicated by the other \nBanks, expanding the reach and succ ess rate of our best and most  beneficial programs. These \nefforts allow us to be more nimble and proactive in responding to common problems. \nWith my remaining time I would like to hi ghlight and recognize some of our more \ninnovative responses to the financial crisis. \n \nForeclosure mitigation/housing \nUnderstandably, our programs related to foreclosures and foreclosure mitigation have \nexpanded significantly and are our primary focu s.  In 2008, the Community Affairs functions \nacross the System sponsored three times as many ev ents related to foreclosure as a year earlier. \nWe have brought together diverse groups such as  developers, realtors, lenders and servicers to \nfoster a common understanding and common approach es. We have made numerous presentations \nto public officials and polic ymakers at all levels.  \nSeveral Federal Reserve Banks have work ed with alliances, including HOPE NOW \nAlliance  and NeighborWorks America, to present for eclosure prevention workshops that bring \n\n4 \n  together borrowers, counselors and servicers to di rectly identify and addre ss individual consumer \nproblems. Without a doubt, the most notable of these events was coordinated by the Boston Fed \nand held at Gillette Stadium, th e home of the New England Patriots. That event, which involved \nnumerous partners including the Patriots ’ charitable foundation, br ought more than 2,000 \nhomeowners facing foreclosure t ogether with mortgage servicer s. In Kansas City, where the \nimpact of the crisis has been slightly different, a similar event where organizers expected to help \n350 troubled borrowers ended up providing assist ance to more than twice that number.  \nAs we have seen a rise in fo reclosure-related scams, the Fed has been active, working with \nNeighborWorks America on a public service campai gn to raise awareness about the issue. We \nhave also created an innovative series of ads de veloped by the Board of Governors that will be \nshown in movie theaters, much like motion-picture trailers, in targeted communities where we are \nfinding the problem is prevalent. \nWe have established Web-based Foreclosure Resource Centers on each of the 12 Federal \nReserve Banks’ websites to help address local and regional challenges in  mortgage markets and \nlocal communities. The Foreclosure Resource Ce nters are customized by each Bank, based on the \nregion-specific conditions. The Board's public site  includes a map linking to  each of the regional \nforeclosure centers. For homeowne rs and homebuyers, the centers pr ovide contact information for \nagencies that can help those in financial trouble or provide counsel  for those who want to buy their \nfirst home. For community leaders and local m unicipalities, the centers offer information on \npreserving and protecting the neighborhoods where foreclosures have occurred. The centers also \nprovide access to Federal Reserve res earch and notices of upcoming events. \nThe Fed has published dynamic maps showing conditions and density  of owner-occupied \nsubprime mortgage loans at the st ate, county and zip code level. The maps are based on data for \nowner-occupied mortgage loans that have been s ecuritized into a product that is categorized as \nsubprime, based on the grade assigned to the secur ity. State- and county-leve l maps and data with \n\n5 \n  TransUnion credit card and mortga ge delinquency rates and changes have also been added to the \nsite. The interactive maps provide a national sour ce for information on foreclosure incidence with \nthe ability to drill down further into  conditions at the regional level.  \nOur Community Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit assists community organizations and local \ngovernments in addressing the current turmoil in the housing market and minimizing the impact of \nforeclosures on neighborhoods.  The resources in the Community Foreclos ure Mitigation Toolkit \nare presented as a four-step process to: 1) asse ss the foreclosure situati on; 2) reach troubled \nhomeowners; 3) establish post-foreclosure s upport systems; and 4) stabilize neighborhoods. \nCommunity Affairs offices worked to devel op best practices for creating, packaging and \ndistributing foreclosure crisis tool kits for smaller municipalities. \nThe Federal Reserve convened the Recovery/R enewal/Rebuilding series of conferences \nand seminars throughout the summer and fall of 2008. Events hosted by the Federal Reserve \nBanks of Atlanta, San Francisco, Cleveland and St . Louis were designed both to investigate ways \nto address the negative spillover effects of foreclosures and to help the Federal Reserve gather \ninsights on the many complex factors around forecl osure issues. After the series, a “capstone” \nevent held at the Board of Governors explored a range of policy topics and focused on emerging \nthemes. \nThese forums provided greater focus on the imp act of the foreclosure crisis on different \nreal estate markets; on strategies that address both  the negative impact of foreclosures in high-cost \nmarkets and the challenge of strengthening neig hborhoods in weak market communities; and on \nhow recent research on foreclosure and vacancy and abandonment might be actualized as public \npolicy. The series also clarified the challenges and the strategies for moving toward solutions. \n  \n\n6 \n   \nOther efforts \nThe area of financial education has been a longtime area of emphasis for the Federal \nReserve. We know there is a connection between  making wise financia l choices and problems \nsuch as foreclosure and other quality-of-life issues including the ability to gain additional \neducation or retire. \nAt the Kansas City Fed, we have looked closel y at the issue of fina ncial education in the \nworkplace. Not only is this an innovative way to potentially reach individuals who might \notherwise go without assistance, there may also be benefits for the employer in addition to the \nemployee. \nMeanwhile, the Chicago Fed pioneered an i nnovative approach to cooperatively promoting \nfinancial education services thr ough its Money Smart Week initiativ e. While this originated prior \nto the current crisis, it has provided an important  tool in highlighting resources available for \nconsumers to use in these difficult times. The Kans as City Fed has taken this model on as a tool \nfor strengthening and expanding access to financia l education services with similar programs \nthroughout our District. \nAlthough education is an importa nt component, we also know th at the complexities of our \nfinancial system can create questions for consumer s who make even the wisest financial choices. \nAlthough the system has served the nation well , consumers can be uncertain about which \nregulatory agency can provide assistance for pa rticular difficulties they may encounter. A \npartnership between the Minneapo lis and Kansas City Feds addr esses this problem, providing a \nhotline and an online resource to help consumers with their questions about specific financial \nproducts and institutions.  \nConsumers need not know which regulator is the appropriate source for assistance, but can \nturn to FederalReserveConsumerHelp.gov or the related toll-free telephone number (888-851-\n\n7 \n  1920) for a wide range of resources  and assistance that can put them  in touch with the appropriate \nregulatory authority. Call center staff members are available duri ng extended hours to talk with \nindividual consumers about specific problems and offer individualized assistance. \n \nConclusion \nThis is only a very small sampling of our Community Affairs programs. And while I am \nmost familiar with the programs involving the Ka nsas City Fed, I know I speak for all of the \nReserve Bank presidents when I say that we take much pride in the work being done by our staffs \nin this area. \nI think it is important to note that many of th ese efforts have grown from the creativity of \nour local Community Affairs staffs located throughout the nation, and many of the most \ninnovative ideas have emerged in recent months. I be lieve we can expect this trend to continue as \nwe look to fully utilize the regi onal expertise, partnerships and programs to provide national \nsolutions. \nI hope this conference is benefi cial to you. I know it is benefici al to us, the policymakers. \nThank you."

While there has been a lot of  debate about how to revive the economy and \nrestore financial stability, there is broad ag reement that the economy will not recover until \nthe financial system is stabilized a nd credit starts flowing more normally. \n \n• The recovery of the financial system depends  critically on the public  regaining trust and \nconfidence in financial institutions, particularly the largest financial in stitutions. The public’s \nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken, \nthe poor management of those risks and the resu lting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal \nfinancial market activity depends importantly  on how the problems of the largest bank and \nnonbank financial instituti ons are addressed.   \n \n• Despite the best of intentions, the policies and ac tions directed at restor ing the health of the \nfinancial system have not been c onsistent or transparent. It is  understandable that the initial \nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because  the depth and breadth of the problems were \nnot expected and there were no plans in  place for addressing the problems.   \n \n• The solution must be a clear and fair plan so  that financial firms, investors and consumers \nknow what to expect when any financial institu tion runs into problems. Specifically, the plan \nmust provide a process for how policymakers will  address the deterioration of the financial \ncondition of all financial firms,  regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become \ninsolvent.   \n \n• A resolution process is part icularly important for the largest, most complex and \ninterconnected institutions because they have be en considered by many as “too big to fail,” at \nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution proc ess that can be used for any \nfinancial firm involved in the intermediation pr ocess or payments system, but the focus is on \nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too big to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the be st solution for the economy.   \n \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework \n \n• A free market system requires that business ow ners capture the profits from their successes \nand bear the costs of their failures. Firms that me et the market test will grow, while those that \ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowe d to go out of business if they fail. The \nconsequences of failure and the resolution fram ework must be clearly stated and transparent \nso that business owners have cl ear expectations about the cons equences of their actions.   \n \n• The resolution framework must prescribe a predefined set of ru les, guided by an agreed upon \nset of principles. This is particularly important  for financial institutions, big or small, because \ntheir success depends critically  on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable, \nongoing concern.  \n \n2 \n \n\n \n• There are two key principles that the resolution process should follow. \n \n• First, the resolution process should minimi ze the cost to the overall economy.   \n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant \nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems. \n- The process should minimize the cost of reso lving an insolvency to avoid a long-term \nfiscal burden on taxpayers.  \n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and \nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.  \n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, such as the government bearing some of the \nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.   \n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly \nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.   \n- To minimize the future cost to the econom y, the resolution process must not create \nadverse incentives that are inconsistent w ith economic efficiency.  Specifically, the \nresolution process must not allow a firm’s management, shareholders and creditors to \navoid the consequences of their mistakes b ecause it reduces market discipline, creates \nadverse incentives for firms to take too much  risk, and inefficientl y directs resources and \nfinancial capital to less-productive uses. \n- The process must be transparen t and clearly stated so that  everyone understands what to \nexpect and the consequences of their actio ns. Management must know beforehand what \nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant, \nnegative effect on the firm ’s financial condition. \n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution pr ocess should be based on solid research and \ninformation about what works and what doe s not work. Policymakers can learn a lot \nabout what will and will not be  successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial \ncrises, as well as at cris es in other countries.   \n \n• The second principle is the resolu tion process must be equitable in  that it is the same for all \nfinancial firms regardless of size or location, although it is possible that the outcome will \ndiffer.  -  The resolution process must provide cons istent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers,  regardless of the institution’s size, \ncomplexity or location.   \n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the differe nce between process \nand outcome.   \n- For example, if a bank is examined and f ound to be insolvent, the bank should go through \nthe resolution process and the owners shoul d lose their investment regardless of the \nbank’s size.  The outcome may be that a rela tively small bank is resolved by another \ninstitution purchasing its assets  and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is \ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank. \n- In both cases, the banks go through the same pr ocess of being declared insolvent and the \nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.   \n3 \n \n\n- Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risk s just to grow to a size large enough to \nreceive favorable treatment, and customers may choose to go with a large bank instead of \na small bank.  \nOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution  \n \n• There are several options for resolving a faile d firm, but it is important to first define \ninsolvency. \n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its co mmon equity capital is negative – that is, the \nfirm’s outstanding liabilities owed  to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets. \n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a posi tive amount of equity capital, is not viable \nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to  meet its current payment obligations, either \nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to  pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses \nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.   \n- It is important to note that these are defi nitions of insolvency and are not subjective \nconditions, which points out that the term “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It \ndoes not matter what size a firm is – if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.  \n• The question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?   \n \n• One option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to main tain ongoing operations \nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment obligations.   - In this case, nothing is actual ly resolved, and the insolvent firm is essentially bailed out \nso that it can continue normal operations.  \n- This option may be used for a large financial firm that is consider ed “too big to fail” \nbecause of concerns that it is  systemically important, in th e sense that other resolution \nmethods would have large, negati ve spillover effects on economy.   \n- Under this option, the term “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve” because of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and \nfinancial system. \n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; curren t shareholders do not \nlose their investment, alt hough the government may impose some restrictions on the \nfirm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses. \n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of th e first principle of minimizing costs.   \n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not immediately cause further problems, it sets th e stage for significant future problems. In a \nbailout, senior management, directors and curr ent shareholders stand to reap any gains \nthat may result, which weakens market discip line and creates the moral hazard that the \nfirm will take too much risk.   \n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and \nnot for smaller firms that are not expected to  cause spillover effect s if other resolution \nmethods are used. \n \n• Alternatively, bank regulators have for years us ed a variety of options to resolve insolvent \nbanks. These options include: \n4 \n \n\n- liquidation,  \n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s asse ts and assumption of its  liabilities by another \ninstitution,  \n- or operating the bank for a short period of  time through open-bank assistance or as a \nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of \nprivate investors. \n \n• When most people think of a firm as failing, th ey generally think the firm is shut down and \nliquidated.   \n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed as a receiver and it pays off insured depositors up to the deposit insurance limit. \n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid partial amounts based on expected recoveries. \n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets  by selling them or holding on to them and \nworking them out. The proceeds from the asse ts are used to first pay remaining amounts \nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecure d creditors, and if a nything is left over, \nto shareholders.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they may have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts. \n- While liquidation strongly enforces market discipline and does not promote moral hazard, it tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and \ntherefore is the least desirable choice.   \n- This option is disruptive for individuals and business custom ers because they tend to hold \nshort-term instruments, such as deposits a nd commercial paper, for making payments or \nas a temporary way of storing their f unds. Many business customers also have \ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when the bank is liquidated. \n \n• The resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumpti on (P&A) transaction, \nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another ba nk to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and \nassume its liabilities.   \n- In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution method because the FDIC may receive a prem ium from the acquiring bank. And even if \nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assu me the liabilities, it is often less costly \nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquida te the failed bank’s \nassets. \n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy. \n- Short-term creditors and count erparties have immediate acces s to all insured deposits and \nat least a large portion of uninsured obligati ons, while borrowers continue to have access \nto credit.   \n- In addition, because management and directors are replaced and shareholders lose their \ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not re duce market discipline or create adverse \nincentives for bank management and shareholders. \n   \n• While a P&A transaction is often the best optio n for most failed banks, it generally is not the \nbest option if one of the largest financial inst itutions fails because it creates even larger \ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.   \n5 \n \n\n- A major difficulty in the current financial crisis has been that some institutions are so \nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no \nmatter what option is used.   \n- Only another institution in the same size range  would have the capacity and resources to \npurchase the assets and assume the liabil ities of another large institution.   \n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been several examples of large institutions taking over other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if in stitutions can get “too \nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, th e resolution process should not result in even \nlarger institutions.  \n• The final option, which is the most feasible fo r a large, complex financial institution that \nfails, is to run it temporarily as a cons ervatorship or bri dge organization.   \n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy. \n- This option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to conduct the necessary due diligence. \n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible. \n- As will be discussed below, management, shar eholders and creditors would be forced to \nbear the full cost of their actions and positio ns they have taken to maintain market \ndiscipline and economic efficiency.   \n \n• One of the difficulties with all of these options  is that while there are time-tested, fast \nresolution processes in place for depository inst itutions, today’s largest financial institutions \nare conglomerate financial holdi ng companies with many financia l subsidiaries that are not \nbanks.   \n- The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option \nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bankruptcy process.   \n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete – sometimes years – which \nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it  can continue normal operations while in \nbankruptcy.   \n- It does not work for financial firms, however , because they have a variety of complex, \nshort-term liabilities and counterparty a rrangements that customers depend on for \nmaintaining daily operations.  A long, draw n-out bankruptcy pro ceeding would prevent \ncustomers and counterparties from having access to their funds, which would cause significant economic disruptions. \n- In addition, the cornerstone of  a financial institution’s fran chise value is trust in its \nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sure to quickly erode in a long, drawn-out bankruptcy proceeding.   \n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding comp anies quickly and in a way that minimizes \nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a \nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.   \n \n• Enacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the \nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and shoul d act immediately to \nresolve a large financial company should one fail. \n \n \n6 \n \n\n \nA Proposed Resolution Process \n \n• The resolution process discussed below is applicable  to any financial firm that is part of the \nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the \nfocus is on systemically important financial in stitutions that are f ound to be insolvent. \n \n• To prevent systemic disruptions to the econom y, a failed institution should be allowed to \ncontinue its operations through a bridge instituti on or conservatorship so that all essential \nservices and operations would go on as normal.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, it would need  additional capital to continue operating.   \n- To recapitalize the firm, the government c ould provide the capital in exchange for \npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.   \n \n• In general, the supervisory authorities would not  have the authority to declare the institution \ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management a nd shareholders bear the costs of their actions \nand investment decisions, the government’s investment would be conditional on: \n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure. \n- Existing shareholders providing the governme nt warrants to purchase all outstanding \nshares, with the amount exercised determined  by the net costs of resolving the firm. \n- While shareholders may be reluctant to agree to these conditions, in most cases, they would have little choice give n the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance. \n \n• The specific steps to be taken would depend on seve ral factors, such as the type of financial \norganization and the supervisor’s  existing legal authority.   \n- For example, if a holding company’s primar y asset is an insured bank and the bank and \nholding company become insolvent, the bank co uld be closed and the FDIC could set up \na bridge bank.   \n- In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervis ory authorities could \ntake actions to mitigate the imp act on the rest of the economy.  \n \n• The most difficult part of reso lving these large firms without a new resolution process is how \nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.   \n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing oblig ations would be addressed and dealt with \naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.   \n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would \nhave immediate access to matu ring funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on \nexpected recoveries, any collateral pr otection and likely market impact.   \n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulator y authorities to declare a nonbank financial \nfirm insolvent. \n \n• Regardless of how the firm is re solved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors \nwill be treated. \n7 \n \n\n- Short-term liabilities in partic ular would need to be addressed immediately because of \ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’  daily payment obligations and operations \nneeds.   \n- Quick decisions also need to be made on all counterparty arrangements because of the \nwidespread impact that uncerta inty about their status or default would have on their \ncounterparties.   \n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of  their decisions and market discipline is \nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in \nline behind more senior cred itors as the claims on the bank are resolved.   \n- However, the authorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, \nwhether the losses associated w ith this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in \nfinancial markets and serious funding problems th at would threaten th e viability of other \nfinancial firms.  \n \n• In a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short-\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prev ent a systemic disruption to the \neconomy.   \n- However, this guarantee should be considered as a “systemic” exception to the normal process.   \n- To limit the use of this exception to truly sy stemic situations, C ongress should enact an \napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991 \nFDIC Improvement Act.   \n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds \nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Tr easury, in consultation w ith the president.  \n- In addition, though the extension of government  guarantees and the re sulting reduction in \nmarket discipline should generally be avoided, extension of the same guarantees would need to be made to every other institution. Otherwise, failed instit utions would have a \ncompetitive advantage over sound institutions, which clearly violates the principle of \nequitable treatment.   \n \n• Another key part of the resoluti on is the bad assets need to be  taken off the balance sheet of \nthe failed institution at realistic market values.   \n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting in two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”   \n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the r eceiver could take the bad assets and work \nthem out.   \n- After writing off the bad assets, the gove rnment would provide the good bank with \nenough capital so that it can become a pr ofitable ongoing concern and attractive to \nprivate investors for even tual reprivatization.   \n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would firs t go toward paying off the costs of the \ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \n \n• The separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forwar d-looking process for recovery \nand the eventual reprivat ization of the good bank.   \n8 \n \n\n- When a bank has a large share of nonperforming  assets, they remain a burden when they \nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.   \n- For example, they still have to be funded even though they are not producing income, \nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s fi nancial condition, and they divert a lot of \nmanagement’s attention from more productiv e activities for the future growth and \nprofitability of the bank.   \n- In addition, the business objectiv es and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and \nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills for running an ongoing financial firm.   \n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand \noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is to get rid of customers and wind down the operations.      \n \n• As part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory author ities should consider breaking up \nor selling off operations and indepe ndent subsidiaries where possible. \n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market \ndiscipline problems.   \n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication th at it is too large and \ncomplex to manage well.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \n \n• A variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest fina ncial firms fail. These \nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However, \nthe resolution process being advocated he re has a record of success elsewhere.  \n \n• First, the proposed resolution pr ocess is exactly what the Swed es did to solve an equally \nsevere banking crisis that they had in the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to \n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed descri ption of the Swedish crisis and resolution \nprocess).   \n- The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was \ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.   \n- Sweden took decisive steps to identify lo sses in its major financial institutions.   \n- The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and \npublic authorities quickly t ook over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad \nassets to be managed within  a separate entity.    \n- Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its financial system, and although it \ntook several years to work down and sell off a ll of the bad assets, th ere was essentially no \nnet cost to the taxpayers.   \n- Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were \nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors \nand other unsecured creditors.   \n • Some people do not think that the Swedish situ ation is a valid comparison because it dealt \nwith only six banks.  In addition, some argue  that the Swedish system was much less \ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans, \n9 \n \n\nnot the complex financial assets, such as stru ctured securities and derivatives, that would \nhave to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail.  While these \nconcerns are valid, it shou ld be noted that:   \n- Although the United States has several thous and banks, only 19 banks have more than \n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is \nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.   \n- It is actually very difficult to work out pr oblems on real estate assets, and it is not \nnecessarily more difficult to work  out even complex securities.  \n \n• As an aside, an additional lesson that can be le arned from Sweden is th at a resolution process \nis much more likely to succeed if it has broa d political support and is structured to be \nindependent of the political process.   \n- The plan should be put largely under the control of independent supervisory agencies. \n- Political involvement should be confined la rgely to specifying the program’s goals and \nbasic rules.   \n- The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the \nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces  the need for political involvement. \n \n• A second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstruction Finance Corporation \n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems  in the United States in the 1930s.   \n- The RFC began by examining problem banks and writing down the bad assets to realistic economic values. \n- It then made any needed and appropriate  changes in bank management and provided \npublic equity capital as needed. \n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its \ncosts.  \n• A final example is the failure of Continenta l Illinois National Bank a nd its holding company \nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution \nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed pr ocess.  In addition, it is an \nexample of a resolution of  a large, complex, interconnected holding company. \n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial and industrial lender and the \nseventh- largest U.S. bank.  It had 57 offi ces in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a \nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent re lationships, and a separate \nfunction for making residential and commercial real estate loans.  It also provided specialized services to a variety of companies.   \n- The attached document, “Assistance for Con tinental Illinois,” provides details about the \nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company. \n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the \nholding company shareholders lo st their entire investment, and the bank was restored to \nsound condition and returned  to private ownership. \n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns about the systemic consequences of impos ing losses on uninsured depositors and other \nunsecured creditors.    \n10 \n \n\n• Another concern that has been ra ised about letting the largest fi nancial firms fail is that it \nnationalizes these institutions.  As  part of this concern, it is  also often pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \n- In the proposed process, no firm  would be nationalized.   \n- Nationalization is the proce ss of the government taking ove r a going concern with the \nintent of continued ownership.   \n- Though a bridge institution is the most likely ou tcome for a large financial firm that fails, \nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized  as quickly as possible, subject to the \ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.   \n- In addition, subject to regulatory agency overs ight, the bridge firm would be managed by \nprivate sector managers selected for th eir experience in operating well-run, large, \ncomplex organizations.    \n \n• Some opponents to the proposed process also claim it would be very difficult to take over \nthese firms and bring in new management becau se they are too complex to manage, as well \nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, a nd skills to fill the \nopen positions.   \n- The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with \nexperience running large, complex organizations.   \n- In addition, while the institution might be co mplex, a new management team is clearly \nbetter than leaving the institution under the c ontrol of the management team that caused it \nto fail in the first place.   \n- More generally, it is hard to believe that th ere is not enough talent, either from the United \nStates or other countries, to run these organizations. \n                      \n11 \n \n\nAssistance for Continental Illinois \n \nI. Problems at Continental Illinois \n \n• In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continen tal Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid \ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lendi ng, that was largely funded \nby purchased money. \n• It became the seventh-largest U.S. bank a nd largest commercial lender in the United \nStates. \n• Penn Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy \nmarkets led to declining asset quality a nd earnings at Continental from 1982 into \n1984 and forced Continental to rely heav ily on foreign money markets for funding. \n• News stories in May 1984 on Continenta l’s problems started a run by foreign \ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, th ey had withdrawn more than $6 billion. \n• The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago be gan lending through the discount window to \ncover the lost deposits, and Continenta l put together a $4.5 billion loan package \nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.  \n \nII.  Interim Financial Assistance \n \n• On May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Fede ral Reserve announced an interim \nassistance package for Continental, wh ich was based on the FDIC’s open bank \nassistance authority. \n• The FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at  Continental in order to keep a liquidity \ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks , prevent significant lo sses at the many banks \nthat had correspondent accounts at Continen tal and avoid other negative effects in \nU.S. financial markets. \n• A $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest-\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FD IC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining \n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks. \n• The Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liq uidity needs of Con tinental, and a group \nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to pr ovide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an \nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed. \n• The FDIC was unable to find any merger part ners for Continental during this interim \nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s a sset problems, substa ntial litigation and \nfunding issues, along with the limited numb er of merger partners under Illinois’ \ninterstate banking restrictions. \n     \nIII. Permanent Financial Assistance \n \n• In July 1984, a permanent assistance pl an was put in place for Continental. \n12 \n \n\n• Continental’s top management and board  of directors were removed.  John \nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding \ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice  chairman of Chase Manhattan, became \nCEO of the bank. \n• The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Contin ental’s discount window borrowings from \nthe Federal Reserve. \n• In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book \nvalue) of assets from Continental.  This consisted of poor quality loans that \nContinental had already written  down to $3 billion (these loans were further written \ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and C ontinental was forced to take a charge of \n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continenta l for $1.5 billion, which \nContinental could repay within three year s by giving the FDIC additional loans of \nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion. \n• To offset the $1 billion charge to Continen tal’s capital that was required by the loan \nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capita l into Continental. The FDIC’s capital \ninfusion consisted of $720 million of permanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior \nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9 \npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of \npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative pr eferred stock in the holding company. This \nassistance was provided through the holding co mpany rather than the bank because \ncovenants in the holding company’s debt in struments required debtholder approval to \nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it. \n• The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it for any losses, carrying \ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired. \n• The $2 billion in subordinated notes issu ed under the interim plan was repaid. \n• To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation \ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel,  Continental employees under incentive \ncontracts and hired specialists. \n     \nIV. Return to Private Ownership and the Cost of Resolving Continental Illinois \n \n• In a series of sales that took place be tween December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC \nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option. \n• The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their en tire investment once \nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as  compensation for loan liquidation losses.  \n• From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private \nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital \ninvestment, and it also received more than  $200 million in dividends on this stock. \n• Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from  Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion, \nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continenta l’s assets at the ti me of resolution. \n13 \n \n\n• Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n14 \n \n\nSwedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• Economic and financial market conditions lead ing up to the Swedish banking crisis were \nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis. \n- Deregulation of financial markets (eliminati on of quantitative controls on bank lending, \nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on cap ital flows) is similar to recent deregulation \n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial i nnovations (securitization, derivatives). \n- Large inflow of foreign capital and e xpansion of domestic  lending and debt. \n- Low/negative real interest rates. \n- Strong growth in consumption and real es tate investment and low savings rate. \n- Sharp increases in asset prices  (stocks and real estate). \n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real \ninterest rates, the impact on the economy  was similar to the current crisis.  \n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (t angible asset values fell about 30 percent). \n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankrupt cies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and \n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively). \n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from  being slightly negative at the end of the \n1980s to 8 percent in 1993. \n- Residential real estate investment froze.  \n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan – temporary government investment in banks \nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically feasible.  \n• Political support – th e program had broad political support, which was important for quick \ndecisive actions and providing the national leadership necessary for public support. \n• Political independence – a Bank Support Authorit y, separate from the financial supervisory \nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the \nprogram.  The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from political interference in ma king decisions, although the BSA worked closely with the \nsupervisory authority  and central bank. \n• Debt guarantees \n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other cr editors were fully protected from future \nlosses, including foreign creditors (account ed for about 40 percent of bank funding). \n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis  ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed \ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the \ncrisis). \n• Transparency  - The government was very open about the process. \n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and \nrealistic asset values, and asset values that  had declined were promptly written down. \n• Bank recapitalization  - A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject \nto various economic scenarios.  Banks were placed in one of three categories based on their \nviability in the worst-case scenario, which de termined the type of government support they \nwould receive. \n- Category 1 – Capital deteriorates but re mains above minimum requirements.   \n15 \n \n\nThe bank was expected to raise additional cap ital, with temporary government guarantees \navailable if necessary to help  maintain public confidence. \n- Category 2 – Capital falls below minimum require ments but is expected to rise above the \nminimum in a reasonable period of time. \nShareholders were expected  to contribute additional capital, with the government \ncontributing capital as necessary to meet operating requirements.  Government received \npreferred shares. \n- Category 3 – Capital becomes negative and ba nk is unlikely to become profitable. \nBank declared insolvent and gove rnment resolves the bank in the least-costly manner, \nincluding the possibility  of liquidation.   \n• Good bank, bad bank model – used for banks that received government support and for \ninsolvent banks.  Nonperforming loans were tran sferred to work-out companies at realistic \nmarket values.  The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound operations and managed by financial market professionals with clea r business objectives. \n• Shareholders were not protected (except for one bank in which the government was the \nmajority shareholder, as noted below).  \n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares. \n- The government also received vo ting power that would grow over time, so the government \nwould eventually become the majority shar eholder if the suppor t was large enough and \nmaintained for a long period of time. \n• Banks that received assistance were given c onditions to make operational improvements. \nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance. \n• Results \n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Categ ory 2) received govern ment capital (the \ngovernment was already the majority sharehol der and it also purcha sed the outstanding \nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and \neventually merged with Nordbanken; a nd Sparbanken received a government loan. \n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely \nintact – there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.  \n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent \nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke ev en, which is based on \ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale \nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proceeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross \nfiscal cost of the support program is estimat ed to have been about 4 percent of GDP.  \n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized a nd is now part of Nordea (the government \nowns about 20 percent), which operates in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. \n• Lessons learned \n- Political consensus on a s upport plan is crucial. \n- Once the plan is formed and implemented, it is  just as important for the process to be \nindependent of political interference and fully transparent to the public. \n- The government officials in charge of the pr ogram must take timely and decisive actions \nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political indepe ndence is important. \n- Assets must be given realistic valuations. \n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose thei r investment, and senior management and the \nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes.  Markets will \nnot be efficient unless those w ho may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs \n16 \n \n\n- The program’s success also requires that th e new management of the good and bad banks \nare financial industry professionals, are gi ven sound business obj ectives and clearly \nunderstand to whom they are responsible,  which is another reason why political \nindependence is important. \n \n                   \n \n                   \n17 \n \n\n18 \n REFERENCES \n \n Davison, Lee. “Continental Illi nois and ‘Too Big to Fail,’” History of the Eighties, Lessons for \nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of th e 1980s and Early 1990s , Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.

While there has been a lot of  debate about how to revive the economy and \nrestore financial stability, there is broad ag reement that the economy will not recover until \nthe financial system is stabilized a nd credit starts flowing more normally. \n \n• The recovery of the financial system depends  critically on the public  regaining trust and \nconfidence in financial institutions, particularly the largest financial in stitutions. The public’s \nconfidence in the largest institutions has been seriously shaken by the risks they have taken, \nthe poor management of those risks and the resu lting losses. Thus, the restoration of normal \nfinancial market activity depends importantly  on how the problems of the largest bank and \nnonbank financial instituti ons are addressed.   \n \n• Despite the best of intentions, the policies and ac tions directed at restor ing the health of the \nfinancial system have not been c onsistent or transparent. It is  understandable that the initial \nmeasures were ad hoc and inconsistent because  the depth and breadth of the problems were \nnot expected and there were no plans in  place for addressing the problems.   \n \n• The solution must be a clear and fair plan so  that financial firms, investors and consumers \nknow what to expect when any financial institu tion runs into problems. Specifically, the plan \nmust provide a process for how policymakers will  address the deterioration of the financial \ncondition of all financial firms,  regardless of their size, and resolve them if they become \ninsolvent.    \n• A resolution process is part icularly important for the largest, most complex and \ninterconnected institutions because they have be en considered by many as “too big to fail,” at \nleast since the early 1980s. This paper describes a resolution proc ess that can be used for any \nfinancial firm involved in the intermediation pr ocess or payments system, but the focus is on \nthe large, systemically important institutions. The premise of the paper is that no firm is too big to fail and that resolving a large failed firm is the be st solution for the economy.   \n \nPrinciples for a Resolution Framework \n \n• A free market system requires that business ow ners capture the profits from their successes \nand bear the costs of their failures. Firms that me et the market test will grow, while those that \ndo not will shrink and, ultimately, must be allowe d to go out of business if they fail. The \nconsequences of failure and the resolution fram ework must be clearly stated and transparent \nso that business owners have cl ear expectations about the cons equences of their actions.   \n \n• The resolution framework must pr escribe a predefined set of ru les, guided by an agreed upon \nset of principles. This is particularly important  for financial institutions, big or small, because \ntheir success depends critically  on the public’s trust that they are solvent and a viable, \nongoing concern.   \n\n3 \n  \n• There are two key principles that the resolution process should follow. \n \n• First, the resolution process should minimi ze the cost to the overall economy.   \n- When resolving an insolvent firm, it is important that it does not cause significant \nfinancial and economic disruptions or exacerbate current problems. \n- The process should minimize the cost of reso lving an insolvency to avoid a long-term \nfiscal burden on taxpayers.  \n- The relevant costs are not just the direct costs but, more importantly, the current and \nfuture impact on the economy and financial system.  \n- The direct costs of resolving a failed bank, su ch as the government bearing some of the \nfailed bank’s losses, is simple to add up.   \n- However, minimizing the future costs on the economy and financial system, particularly \nthe unintended consequences, is much more difficult.   \n- To minimize the future cost to the econom y, the resolution process must not create \nadverse incentives that are inconsistent with economic efficiency.  Specifically, the \nresolution process must not allow a firm’s management, shareholders and creditors to \navoid the consequences of their mistakes b ecause it reduces market discipline, creates \nadverse incentives for firms to take too much  risk, and inefficientl y directs resources and \nfinancial capital to less-productive uses. \n- The process must be transparen t and clearly stated so that  everyone understands what to \nexpect and the consequences of their actio ns. Management must know beforehand what \nwill happen if they gamble and take excessive risks that turn out to have a significant, \nnegative effect on the firm ’s financial condition. \n- Finally, to minimize costs, the resolution pr ocess should be based on solid research and \ninformation about what works and what doe s not work. Policymakers can learn a lot \nabout what will and will not be  successful by looking back at previous U.S. financial \ncrises, as well as at cris es in other countries.   \n \n• The second principle is the resolu tion process must be equitable in  that it is the same for all \nfinancial firms regardless of size or locati on, although it is possible that the outcome will \ndiffer.  -  The resolution process must provide cons istent treatment of a failing institution’s \nowners, managers, employees and customers,  regardless of the institution’s size, \ncomplexity or location.   \n- When talking about equity, it is important to recognize the differe nce between process \nand outcome.   \n- For example, if a bank is examined and f ound to be insolvent, the bank should go through \nthe resolution process and the owners shoul d lose their investment regardless of the \nbank’s size.  The outcome may be that a rela tively small bank is resolved by another \ninstitution purchasing its assets  and assuming its deposits, while a relatively large bank is \ntemporarily operated as a bridge bank. \n- In both cases, the banks go through the same pr ocess of being declared insolvent and the \nsame procedures for determining how it will be resolved.   \n\n4 \n - Otherwise, banks may take on excessive risk s just to grow to a size large enough to \nreceive favorable treatment, and customers ma y choose to go with a large bank instead of \na small bank.  \nOptions for Resolving a Failed Financial Institution  \n \n• There are several options for resolving a faile d firm, but it is important to first define \ninsolvency. \n- By definition, a firm is insolvent if its co mmon equity capital is negative – that is, the \nfirm’s outstanding liabilities owed  to creditors is greater than the total value of its assets. \n- However, a financial firm, even if it has a posi tive amount of equity capital, is not viable \nand will fail if its liquidity is insufficient to  meet its current payment obligations, either \nbecause it cannot sell its assets for enough to  pay off maturing liabilities, or it loses \nmarket confidence and cannot borrow enough.   \n- It is important to note that these are defi nitions of insolvency and are not subjective \nconditions, which points out that the term “too big to fail” really is a misstatement. It \ndoes not matter what size a firm is – if it is insolvent by these definitions, it has failed.  \n• The question becomes, what do we do when a firm fails?   \n \n• One option is for the government to allow an insolvent firm to main tain ongoing operations \nby providing funds to bring capital ratios up to required minimums or to meet payment \nobligations.   - In this case, nothing is actual ly resolved, and the insolvent firm is essentially bailed out \nso that it can continue normal operations.  \n- This option may be used for a large financial firm that is consider ed “too big to fail” \nbecause of concerns that it is  systemically important, in th e sense that other resolution \nmethods would have large, negati ve spillover effects on economy.   \n- Under this option, the term “too big to fail” should be restated as “too big to resolve” \nbecause of the near-term negative spillover effects and disruptions to the economy and \nfinancial system. \n- In a bailout, senior management and directors keep their jobs; curren t shareholders do not \nlose their investment, alt hough the government may impose some restrictions on the \nfirm’s activities and practices; and creditors do not suffer any losses. \n- A bailout is the worst option in terms of th e first principle of minimizing costs.   \n- While a bailout may temporarily stabilize current economic conditions or not \nimmediately cause further problems, it sets th e stage for significant future problems. In a \nbailout, senior management, directors and curr ent shareholders stand to reap any gains \nthat may result, which weakens market discip line and creates the moral hazard that the \nfirm will take too much risk.   \n- Bailouts are also inequitable because they are used only for the “too big to fail” firms and \nnot for smaller firms that are not expected to  cause spillover effect s if other resolution \nmethods are used. \n \n• Alternatively, bank regulators have for years us ed a variety of options to resolve insolvent \nbanks. These options include: \n\n5 \n - liquidation,  \n- arranging for the sale of a failed bank’s asse ts and assumption of its  liabilities by another \ninstitution,  \n- or operating the bank for a short period of  time through open-bank assistance or as a \nbridge bank or conservatorship until the bank can be sold to another bank or group of \nprivate investors. \n \n• When most people think of a firm as failing, th ey generally think the firm is shut down and \nliquidated.   \n- In a bank liquidation, the FDIC is appointed  as a receiver and it pays off insured \ndepositors up to the deposit insurance limit. \n- Uninsured depositors are generally paid pa rtial amounts based on expected recoveries. \n- The FDIC maximizes the value of the assets  by selling them or holding on to them and \nworking them out. The proceeds from the asse ts are used to first pay remaining amounts \nowed to uninsured depositors and other unsecure d creditors, and if a nything is left over, \nto shareholders.   \n- Because the firm is insolvent, the uninsured creditors will suffer some losses, and they \nmay have to wait for a long time to receive their final payouts. \n- While liquidation strongly enforces market discipline and does not promote moral hazard, \nit tends to be the most disruptive option for resolving a big or small financial firm, and \ntherefore is the least desirable choice.   \n- This option is disruptive for individuals and business custom ers because they tend to hold \nshort-term instruments, such as deposits a nd commercial paper, for making payments or \nas a temporary way of storing their f unds. Many business customers also have \ncounterparty arrangements, such as derivatives contracts, that would go into default when \nthe bank is liquidated. \n \n• The resolution method used most often is a purchase and assumpti on (P&A) transaction, \nwhere the FDIC as receiver finds another ba nk to purchase the insolvent bank’s assets and \nassume its liabilities.   - In terms of the direct costs to the government, this is typically the least-cost resolution \nmethod because the FDIC may receive a prem ium from the acquiring bank. And even if \nthe FDIC has to pay the acquiring bank to assu me the liabilities, it is often less costly \nthan paying off insured depositors and having to manage and liquida te the failed bank’s \nassets. \n- More importantly, though, it generally has the least negative impact on the economy. \n- Short-term creditors and count erparties have immediate acces s to all insured deposits and \nat least a large portion of uninsured obligati ons, while borrowers continue to have access \nto credit.   \n- In addition, because management and director s are replaced and shareholders lose their \ninvestment, a P&A transaction does not re duce market discipline or create adverse \nincentives for bank management and shareholders.    \n• While a P&A transaction is often the best optio n for most failed banks, it generally is not the \nbest option if one of the largest financial inst itutions fails because it creates even larger \ncompanies that pose even greater systemic risks to the economy.   \n\n6 \n - A major difficulty in the current financial cr isis has been that some institutions are so \nlarge and complex that resolving them when they fail is complicated and disruptive no \nmatter what option is used.   \n- Only another institution in the same size range  would have the capacity and resources to \npurchase the assets and assume the liabil ities of another large institution.   \n- Indeed, over the past year, there have been se veral examples of large institutions taking \nover other large, problem institutions. It only makes sense that if in stitutions can get “too \nbig to fail,” then all else held constant, th e resolution process shoul d not result in even \nlarger institutions.  \n• The final option, which is the most feasible fo r a large, complex financial institution that \nfails, is to run it temporarily as a cons ervatorship or bri dge organization.   \n- Clearly, a liquidation would be too disruptive to the economy. \n- This option also provides time for potential acquirers of the institution or its parts to \nconduct the necessary due diligence. \n- The institution would then reprivatized as soon as it is economically feasible. \n- As will be discussed below, management, shar eholders and creditors would be forced to \nbear the full cost of their actions and positio ns they have taken to maintain market \ndiscipline and economic efficiency.   \n \n• One of the difficulties with all of these options  is that while there are time-tested, fast \nresolution processes in place for depository inst itutions, today’s largest financial institutions \nare conglomerate financial holdi ng companies with many financia l subsidiaries that are not \nbanks.   - The bank subsidiaries could be placed into FDIC receivership, but the only other option \nunder current law for the holding company and other subsidiaries is a bank ruptcy process.   \n- Bankruptcy proceedings can take a long time to complete – sometimes years – which \nworks well for a nonfinancial firm because it  can continue normal operations while in \nbankruptcy.   \n- It does not work for financial firms, however , because they have a variety of complex, \nshort-term liabilities and counterparty a rrangements that customers depend on for \nmaintaining daily operations.  A long, draw n-out bankruptcy pro ceeding would prevent \ncustomers and counterparties from having access to their funds, which would cause \nsignificant economic disruptions. \n- In addition, the cornerstone of  a financial institution’s fran chise value is trust in its \nviability as an ongoing concern, and that trust is sure to quickly erode in a long, drawn-\nout bankruptcy proceeding.   \n- The difficulty in resolving failed holding comp anies quickly and in a way that minimizes \nthe disruption to the economy is why the Treasury secretary recently proposed a \nresolution process for systemically important financial holding companies.   \n \n• Enacting a resolution process for financial companies is clearly important, but the \nsupervisory authorities do not need to wait for it to happen and shoul d act immediately to \nresolve a large financial company should one fail. \n \n \n\n7 \n  \nA Proposed Resolution Process \n \n• The resolution process discussed below is applicable  to any financial firm that is part of the \nintermediation process or payments system, but in light of the current financial crisis, the \nfocus is on systemically important financial in stitutions that are f ound to be insolvent. \n \n• To prevent systemic disruptions to the econom y, a failed institution should be allowed to \ncontinue its operations through a bridge instituti on or conservatorship so  that all essential \nservices and operations would go on as normal.   - Because the firm is insolvent, it would need  additional capital to continue operating.   \n- To recapitalize the firm, the government c ould provide the capital in exchange for \npreferred shares, convertible to common stock upon sale.   \n \n• In general, the supervisory authorities would not  have the authority to declare the institution \ninsolvent. Thus, to ensure that management a nd shareholders bear the costs of their actions \nand investment decisions, the government ’s investment would be conditional on: \n- Replacement of the senior management and board of directors that led the firm to failure. \n- Existing shareholders providing the governme nt warrants to purchase all outstanding \nshares, with the amount exercised determined  by the net costs of resolving the firm. \n- While shareholders may be reluctant to agre e to these conditions, in most cases, they \nwould have little choice give n the immediate need for liquidity and capital assistance. \n \n• The specific steps to be taken would depend on seve ral factors, such as the type of financial \norganization and the supervisor’s  existing legal authority.   \n- For example, if a holding company’s primar y asset is an insured bank and the bank and \nholding company become insolvent, the bank co uld be closed and the FDIC could set up \na bridge bank.   \n- In this case, the holding company would also fail, and the supervis ory authorities could \ntake actions to mitigate the imp act on the rest of the economy.  \n \n• The most difficult part of reso lving these large firms without a new resolution process is how \nto make creditors bear the cost of their positions.   \n- Ideally, when a firm fails, all existing oblig ations would be addressed and dealt with \naccording to the covenants and contractual priorities set up for each type of debt.   \n- Insured creditors would have immediate access to their funds, while other creditors would \nhave immediate access to matu ring funds with the potential for haircuts, depending on \nexpected recoveries, any collateral pr otection and likely market impact.   \n- However, this is difficult because it would require negotiating with groups of creditors, \nunless there’s a process that allows regulator y authorities to decl are a nonbank financial \nfirm insolvent. \n \n• Regardless of how the firm is re solved, it is critical to make quick decisions on how creditors \nwill be treated. \n\n8 \n - Short-term liabilities in partic ular would need to be addressed immediately because of \ntheir importance in meeting the creditors’  daily payment obligations and operations \nneeds.   \n- Quick decisions also need to be made on a ll counterparty arrangements because of the \nwidespread impact that uncerta inty about their status or default would have on their \ncounterparties.   \n- So that unsecured creditors bear the cost of  their decisions and market discipline is \nmaintained, the resolution authorities should consider leaving these creditors standing in \nline behind more senior cred itors as the claims on the bank are resolved.   \n- However, the authorities would also need to  assess the market impact – specifically, \nwhether the losses associated w ith this outcome would lead to a loss of confidence in \nfinancial markets and serious funding problems th at would threaten th e viability of other \nfinancial firms.  \n \n• In a severe financial crisis, such as is occurring today, it may be necessary to honor short-\nterm liabilities and/or all counterparty arrangements to prev ent a systemic disruption to the \neconomy.   - However, this guarantee should be considered  as a “systemic” exception to the normal \nprocess.   \n- To limit the use of this exception to truly sy stemic situations, C ongress should enact an \napproval process similar to the systemic exception for banks as specified in the 1991 \nFDIC Improvement Act.   \n- This exception requires approval by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds \nof the FDIC Board and the secretary of the Tr easury, in consultation w ith the president.  \n- In addition, though the extension of government  guarantees and the re sulting reduction in \nmarket discipline generally should be avoide d, consideration may need to be given to \nextending the guarantees to other institutions so that failed institutions do not have a competitive advantage over sound institutions. \n \n• Another key part of the resoluti on is the bad assets need to be  taken off the balance sheet of \nthe failed institution at realistic market values.   \n- One option is to place the bad assets in a separate asset management company, resulting \nin two new entities often referred to as a “good bank” and “bad bank.”   \n- Alternatively, the FDIC or Treasury as the r eceiver could take the bad assets and work \nthem out.   \n- After writing off the bad assets, the gove rnment would provide the good bank with \nenough capital so that it can become a pr ofitable ongoing concern and attractive to \nprivate investors for even tual reprivatization.   \n- Any recoveries from the bad bank would firs t go toward paying off the costs of the \ngovernment, and any proceeds left over would be distributed according to the priority of \nremaining claimants. \n \n• The separation of the bad assets is critical for creating a forwar d-looking process for recovery \nand the eventual reprivat ization of the good bank.   \n- When a bank has a large share of nonperforming  assets, they remain a burden when they \nare left on the balance sheet, even if they are written down appropriately.   \n\n9 \n - For example, they still have to be funde d even though they are not producing income, \nthey create uncertainty about the bank’s fi nancial condition, and they divert a lot of \nmanagement’s attention from more productiv e activities for the future growth and \nprofitability of the bank.   \n- In addition, the business objectiv es and the skills necessary for managing bad assets and \nrecovering their maximum value is very different from the objectives and necessary skills for running an ongoing financial firm.   \n- In other words, the goal of the good bank is to attract new customers and expand \noperations, while the goal of the bad bank is  to get rid of customers and wind down the \noperations.      \n \n• As part of the reprivatization process, the supervisory author ities should consider breaking up \nor selling off operations and indepe ndent subsidiaries where possible. \n- The growth of firms into “too big to fail” institutions has created significant market \ndiscipline problems.   \n- In addition, if such a firm were to fail, it may also be an indication th at it is too large and \ncomplex to manage well.   \n \nHow Do We Know the Resolution Process Will Work? \n \n• A variety of concerns has been raised about letting the largest fina ncial firms fail. These \nconcerns are legitimate and it is clear that any solution will be difficult and costly. However, \nthe resolution process being advocated he re has a record of success elsewhere.  \n \n• First, the proposed resolution pr ocess is exactly what the Swed es did to solve an equally \nsevere banking crisis that they had in the early 1990s (see attachment “Swedish Response to \n1990s Banking Crisis” for a more detailed descri ption of the Swedish crisis and resolution \nprocess).   \n- The economic situation in Sweden was similar to today’s, and their financial system was \ndominated by six large banks that accounted for 90 percent of the industry’s assets.   \n- Sweden took decisive steps to identify lo sses in its major financial institutions.   \n- The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized, largely through private sources, and \npublic authorities quickly t ook over two large insolvent banks and spun off their bad \nassets to be managed within  a separate entity.    \n- Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its fi nancial system, and although it \ntook several years to work down and sell off a ll of the bad assets, th ere was essentially no \nnet cost to the taxpayers.   \n- Creditors, however, were fully protected because the supervisory authorities were \nconcerned about the systemic consequences of imposing losses on uninsured depositors \nand other unsecured creditors.   \n \n• Some people do not think that the Swedish situ ation is a valid comparison because it dealt \nwith only six banks.  In addition, some argue  that the Swedish system was much less \ncomplex, and that the government primarily had to work out commercial real estate loans, \nnot the complex financial assets, such as stru ctured securities and de rivatives, that would \n\n10 \n have to be worked out today if a large financial institution was allowed to fail.  While these \nconcerns are valid, it shou ld be noted that:   \n- Although the United States has several thous and banks, only 19 banks have more than \n$100 billion of assets, and that after supervisory authorities evaluate their condition, it is \nlikely that only a few would have to be resolved.   \n- It is actually very difficult to work out pr oblems on real estate assets, and it is not \nnecessarily more difficult to work  out even complex securities.  \n \n• As an aside, an additional lesson that can be le arned from Sweden is th at a resolution process \nis much more likely to succeed if it has broa d political support and is structured to be \nindependent of the political process.   - The plan should be put largely under the c ontrol of independent supervisory agencies. \n- Political involvement should be confined la rgely to specifying the program’s goals and \nbasic rules.   \n- The Swedes also found that a commitment to providing the supervisory authority the \nfunds necessary for resolutions reduces  the need for political involvement. \n \n• A second example is this is essentially the process the Reconstructi on Finance Corporation \n(RFC) used to deal with banking problems  in the United States in the 1930s.   \n- The RFC began by examining problem banks a nd writing down the bad assets to realistic \neconomic values. \n- It then made any needed and appropriate  changes in bank management and provided \npublic equity capital as needed. \n- Finally, it returned the banks to private ownership and essentially recovered all of its \ncosts.  \n• A final example is the failure of Continenta l Illinois National Bank a nd its holding company \nin 1984. This is a good comparison because it is an example of a holding company resolution \nusing preferred stock and warrants as described in the proposed pr ocess.  In addition, it is an \nexample of a resolution of  a large, complex, interconnected holding company. \n- Continental Illinois was the largest U.S. commercial a nd industrial lender and the \nseventh- largest U.S. bank.  It had 57 offi ces in 14 states and 29 foreign countries, a \nnetwork of 2,300 domestic and international correspondent re lationships, and a separate \nfunction for making residential and commercial  real estate loans.  It also provided \nspecialized services to a variety of companies.   \n- The attached document, “Assistance for Con tinental Illinois,” provides details about the \nprocess used to resolve the bank and holding company. \n- The result was that the bank and holding company management were replaced, the \nholding company shareholders lo st their entire investment, and the bank was restored to \nsound condition and returned  to private ownership. \n- As in Sweden, Continental Illinois’ creditors were fully protected because of concerns \nabout the systemic consequences of impos ing losses on uninsured depositors and other \nunsecured creditors.    \n\n11 \n • Another concern that has been ra ised about letting the largest fi nancial firms fail is that it \nnationalizes these institutions.  As  part of this concern, it is  also often pointed out that \ngovernment officials may not be effective ma nagers of private business concerns.   \n- In the proposed process, no firm  would be nationalized.   \n- Nationalization is the proce ss of the government taking ove r a going concern with the \nintent of continued ownership.   \n- Though a bridge institution is the most likely ou tcome for a large financial firm that fails, \nthe goal is for the firm to be reprivatized  as quickly as possible, subject to the \ngovernment not wasting taxpayer funds.   \n- In addition, subject to regulatory agency overs ight, the bridge firm would be managed by \nprivate sector managers selected for th eir experience in operating well-run, large, \ncomplex organizations.    \n \n• Some opponents to the proposed process also cl aim it would be very difficult to take over \nthese firms and bring in new management becau se they are too complex to manage, as well \nas there is not enough people with the required knowledge, experience, a nd skills to fill the \nopen positions.   - The Continental Illinois example shows it is possible bring in a management team with \nexperience running large, complex organizations.   \n- In addition, while the institution might be co mplex, a new management team is clearly \nbetter than leaving the institution under the c ontrol of the management team that caused it \nto fail in the first place.   \n- More generally, it is hard to believe that th ere is not enough talent, either from the United \nStates or other countries, to run these organizations. \n                      \n\n12 \n Assistance for Continental Illinois \n \nI. Problems at Continental Illinois \n \n• In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Continen tal Illinois pursued a strategy of rapid \ngrowth in commercial lending, particularly energy lendi ng, that was largely funded \nby purchased money. \n• It became the seventh-largest U.S. bank a nd largest commercial lender in the United \nStates. \n• Penn Square’s failure in 1982, LDC debt problems and the downturns in energy \nmarkets led to declining asset quality a nd earnings at Continental from 1982 into \n1984 and forced Continental to rely heav ily on foreign money markets for funding. \n• News stories in May 1984 on Continenta l’s problems started a run by foreign \ndepositors on Continental, and by May 19, th ey had withdrawn more than $6 billion. \n• The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago be gan lending through the discount window to \ncover the lost deposits, and Continenta l put together a $4.5 billion loan package \nfunded by 16 large U.S. banks, but these steps did not stop the deposit run.  \n \nII.  Interim Financial Assistance \n \n• On May 17, 1984, the FDIC, OCC and Fede ral Reserve announced an interim \nassistance package for Continental, wh ich was based on the FDIC’s open bank \nassistance authority. \n• The FDIC explicitly guaranteed all deposits at  Continental in order to keep a liquidity \ncrisis from spreading to other U.S. banks , prevent significant lo sses at the many banks \nthat had correspondent accounts at Continen tal and avoid other negative effects in \nU.S. financial markets. \n• A $2 billion capital infusion for Continental was arranged in the form of interest-\nbearing subordinated notes, with the FD IC providing $1.5 billion and the remaining \n$500 million provided by seven of the largest U.S. banks. \n• The Federal Reserve agreed to meet any liq uidity needs of Con tinental, and a group \nof 24 major U.S. banks also agreed to pr ovide more than $5.3 billion in funding on an \nunsecured basis until a permanent solution was developed. \n• The FDIC was unable to find any merger part ners for Continental during this interim \nperiod, presumably due to Continental’s a sset problems, substa ntial litigation and \nfunding issues, along with the limited numb er of merger partners under Illinois’ \ninterstate banking restrictions. \n     \nIII. Permanent Financial Assistance \n \n• In July 1984, a permanent assistance pl an was put in place for Continental. \n\n13 \n • Continental’s top management and board  of directors were removed.  John \nSwearingen, former chairman of Standard Oil of Indiana, became CEO of the holding \ncompany, and William Ogden, a former vice  chairman of Chase Manhattan, became \nCEO of the bank. \n• The FDIC assumed $3.5 billion of Contin ental’s discount window borrowings from \nthe Federal Reserve. \n• In exchange for assuming this debt, the FDIC received $3.5 billion (adjusted book \nvalue) of assets from Continental.  Th is consisted of poor quality loans that \nContinental had already written  down to $3 billion (these loans were further written \ndown to $2 billion in this transaction, and C ontinental was forced to take a charge of \n$1 billion against capital) and a note from Continenta l for $1.5 billion, which \nContinental could repay within three year s by giving the FDIC additional loans of \nContinental’s choice with a book value of $1.5 billion. \n• To offset the $1 billion charge to Continen tal’s capital that was required by the loan \nsale, the FDIC infused $1 billion in capita l into Continental. The FDIC’s capital \ninfusion consisted of $720 million of pe rmanent, convertible, nonvoting, junior \nperpetual preferred stock in Continental’s holding company (this amounted to a 79.9 \npercent ownership stake in Continental if converted) and another $280 million of \npermanent, adjustable-rate, cumulative pr eferred stock in the holding company. This \nassistance was provided through the holding co mpany rather than the bank because \ncovenants in the holding company’s debt in struments required debtholder approval to \nsell the bank or to inject capital directly into it. \n• The FDIC also received an option designed to compensate it fo r any losses, carrying \ncosts or collection costs on the loans it acquired. \n• The $2 billion in subordinated notes issu ed under the interim plan was repaid. \n• To economize on FDIC staff and to provide additional expertise, the loan liquidation \ninvolved a combination of FDIC personnel,  Continental employees under incentive \ncontracts and hired specialists.      \nIV. Return to Private Ownership and the Co st of Resolving Continental Illinois \n \n• In a series of sales that took place be tween December 1986 and June 1991, the FDIC \nsold all of its preferred stock and the stock acquired through its option. \n• The shareholders in Continental’s holding company lost their en tire investment once \nthe FDIC exercised the option it received as  compensation for loan liquidation losses.  \n• From the sale of stock, which completed the return of Continental to private \nownership, the FDIC had a net gain of $200 million over its initial $1 billion capital \ninvestment, and it also received more than  $200 million in dividends on this stock. \n• Overall, the loss on the FDIC’s books from  Continental’s failure was $1.1 billion, \nwhich is equal to 3.28 percent of Continenta l’s assets at the ti me of resolution. \n\n14 \n • Bank of America eventually bought Continental in August 1994.   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n\n15 \n Swedish Response to 1990s Banking Crisis \n \n• Economic and financial market conditions lead ing up to the Swedish banking crisis were \nvery similar to the conditions leading up to the current crisis. - Deregulation of financial markets (eliminati on of quantitative controls on bank lending, \nceilings on interest rates and restrictions on cap ital flows) is similar to recent deregulation \n(Gramm-Leach- Bliley) and financial i nnovations (securitization, derivatives). \n- Large inflow of foreign capital and e xpansion of domestic  lending and debt. \n- Low/negative real interest rates. \n- Strong growth in consumption and real es tate investment and low savings rate. \n- Sharp increases in asset prices  (stocks and real estate). \n• Although the economic downturn leading to the crisis was precipitated by rising real \ninterest rates, the impact on the economy  was similar to the current crisis.  \n- Stock and real estate prices fell sharply (t angible asset values fell about 30 percent). \n- Bankruptcies increased dramatically (bankrupt cies grew about 20 percent, 40 percent and \n70 percent in 1989, 1990 and 1991, respectively). \n- Consumption fell and the savings rate rose from  being slightly negative at the end of the \n1980s to 8 percent in 1993. \n- Residential real estate  investment froze.  \n• Goal of financial support and recovery plan – temporary government investment in banks \nwhere necessary, but banks were to be placed in private ownership as soon as economically \nfeasible.  \n• Political support – th e program had broad political support, which was important for quick \ndecisive actions and providing the nationa l leadership necessary for public support. \n• Political independence – a Bank Support Authorit y, separate from the financial supervisory \nauthority and central bank, was established under the Ministry of Finance to manage the \nprogram.  The Bank Support Authority (BSA) had open-ended funding and was free from \npolitical interference in ma king decisions, although the BS A worked closely with the \nsupervisory authority  and central bank. \n• Debt guarantees \n- All bank depositors, counterparties, and other cr editors were fully protected from future \nlosses, including foreign creditors (account ed for about 40 percent of bank funding). \n- Guarantees were eliminated when the crisis  ended in the mid-1990s, and a bank-financed \ndeposit insurance system was created (Sweden did not have deposit insurance prior to the \ncrisis). \n• Transparency  \n- \nThe government was very open about the process. \n- A valuation board composed of real estate experts was used to ensure consistent and \nrealistic asset values, and asset values that  had declined were promptly written down. \n• Bank recapitalization  \n- A bank’s future viability was estimated using a quantitative model of profitability subject \nto various economic scenarios.  Banks were plac ed in one of three categories based on their \nviability in the worst-case scenario, which de termined the type of government support they \nwould receive. \n- Category 1 – Capital deteriorates but re mains above minimum requirements.   \n\n16 \n The bank was expected to raise additional cap ital, with temporary government guarantees \navailable if necessary to help  maintain public confidence. \n- Category 2 – Capital falls below minimum require ments but is expected to rise above the \nminimum in a reasonable period of time. \nShareholders were expected  to contribute additional capital, with the government \ncontributing capital as necessary to meet ope rating requirements.  Government received \npreferred shares. \n- Category 3 – Capital becomes negative and ba nk is unlikely to become profitable. \nBank declared insolvent and gove rnment resolves the bank in the least-costly manner, \nincluding the possibility  of liquidation.   \n• Good bank, bad bank model – used for banks that received government support and for \ninsolvent banks.  Nonperforming loans were tran sferred to work-out companies at realistic \nmarket values.  The good bank is provided additional capital as necessary for sound operations and managed by financial market pr ofessionals with clea r business objectives. \n• Shareholders were not protected (except fo r one bank in which the government was the \nmajority shareholder, as noted below).  \n- Government’s preferred shares were offset by a corresponding reduction in private shares. \n- The government also received vo ting power that would grow over time, so the government \nwould eventually become the majority shar eholder if the suppor t was large enough and \nmaintained for a long period of time. \n• Banks that received assistance were given c onditions to make operational improvements. \nGovernment representatives were placed on the bank boards to ensure compliance. \n• Results \n- Among the six major banks, Nordbanken (Categ ory 2) received govern ment capital (the \ngovernment was already the majority sharehol der and it also purcha sed the outstanding \nprivately held shares); Gota (Category 3) failed, was taken over by the government and \neventually merged with Nordbanken; a nd Sparbanken received a government loan. \n- The banking crisis was largely over by 1996 and the banking system remained largely \nintact – there were no runs and few signs of a credit crunch.  \n- While there is no official estimate of the cost of the support program, the most recent \nestimate of the net fiscal cost is that the government broke ev en, which is based on \ngovernment outlays during the most acute phases of the crises and revenues from the sale \nof bad assets, preferred shares and other proc eeds over the past 15 years. The initial gross \nfiscal cost of the support program is estimat ed to have been about 4 percent of GDP.  \n- Ultimately, Nordbanken was largely privatized a nd is now part of Nordea (the government \nowns about 20 percent), which operates in  Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. \n• Lessons learned \n- Political consensus on a s upport plan is crucial. \n- Once the plan is formed and implemented, it is  just as important for the process to be \nindependent of political interference and fully tr ansparent to the public. \n- The government officials in charge of the pr ogram must take timely and decisive actions \nto resolve problem firms, which is one reason political indepe ndence is important. \n- Assets must be given realistic valuations. \n- Shareholders at failing banks must lose thei r investment, and senior management and the \nboard of directors must be replaced for both efficiency and equity purposes.  Markets will \nnot be efficient unless those w ho may benefit from taking risk actions also bear the costs \n\n17 \n when those actions lead to losses, and equita ble treatment requires that the same rules \napply to all firms regardless of size. \n- The program’s success also requires that th e new management of the good and bad banks \nare financial industry professionals, are gi ven sound business obj ectives and clearly \nunderstand to whom they are responsible,  which is another reason why political \nindependence is important. \n                    \n \n                   \n\n18 \n REFERENCES \n \n Davison, Lee. “Continental Illi nois and ‘Too Big to Fail,’” History of the Eighties, Lessons for \nthe Future, Vol. 1, An Examination of the Banking Crises of th e 1980s and Early 1990s , Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, 1997, Chapter 7, pp. 235-257.

Hoenig  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \nFinancial Stability Institute, Bank for International Settlements  \nHigh -Level Meeting on Recent Developments in Financial Markets and Supervisory Responses  \nLima, Peru  \nApril 2, 2009  \n \n\n2 \n I am honored to be asked to provide some opening comments for this  conference.   \n \nOver the past year, we  have all been heavily involved in  the global financial crisis . As \npolicymakers and re gulators, our mission during this turmoil is twofold. We are responding  to \nemerging events , but at the same time we are also challenged with making  the changes necessary \nto protect  the financial system from a similar crisis in the future.  \nSo, the  urgency on all sides is certainly warranted. The time it takes to resolve these \nissues only increases the cost and further delays the potential for a full global economic recovery. \nUnfortu nately , urgency often creates an environment where quick decis ions prevail over well -\nthought -out sol utions. T he focus in times such as these is often on proximate causes instead of \nunderlying problems.  The current  crisis , unfortunately,  has been no differe nt. \nThere were many events involved in this crisis , and as I react to them and consider what \nthey mean from a regulatory perspective , I would suggest three key areas  that need to change.  \nFirst, r egulation must be based on a clear set of simple, understandable and enforceable \nrules rather that a set of broad  principles open to interpretation.  \nSecond, t his has been the first real test of Basel II , and it has failed  to achieve its \nobjective . \nThird , we must produce a means for resolving  firms  that some would deem “too -big-to-\nfail.” These institutions do fail and we must allow  them to do so  in a way that controls damage to \nthe entire financial sector.  \n \nPrinciples -Based vs. Rules -Based Regulation  \nIn recent years, there have been increasing calls for the United States and many other \ncountries to shift toward  a risk -focused and principles -based approach to supervision and \n\n3 \n regulation.  Unlike a rules -based system, which might establish maximum loan -to-value ratios or \nlimit the amount an institution can lend, a principles -based system specifies desired outcomes \nand allows the regulated firms  extensive control over  how they  achieve those results .  \nAs a regulator responsible for ensuring stability, I can s um up the argument of principles \nversus rules v ery simply in my mind: P rinciples provide financial institutions with opportunities \nto debate ; rules provide supervisors with the best chance to properly  enforce  sound practices . \nThose who support a principles -based system say that with rapid growth in the financial \nmarkets, supervisors no longer have the resources to monitor compliance wit h every rule and \nregulation.  They say the principles -based approach  gives  institutions more flexibility in adapting \nto a rapidly ev olving financial environment, thereby making  a country’s financial markets more \nattractive, innovative and com petitive on a worldwide basis.  \nTo that I would respond that  a carefully crafted rules -based approach does not hamper \nfinancial innovation.  Good rulemaking incorporates public comment , thus giving institutions an \nopportunity to suggest less burdensome and more effective ways to achieve regulator y goals.  In a \nrules -based environment, superviso rs cannot  just mechanically impose the rules on regulated \nfirms, but must  rely on a good  dialog ue with the firms as an important part of the supervisory  \nprocess.  \nBecause principles must constantly be interpreted, a principles -based approach by its very \nnature fosters an environment of less clarity and reduced transparency  in the regulatory system . \nWith  issues  open to interpretation, supervisors also have less power to enforce  regulations when \nan institution  disagrees.  This problem is particularly serious  when  an economy is strong and  \nquestionable activities may appear  to be successful  in the environment of the time . The result  is \nlikely to be a gradual erosion of regulatory standards during prosper ous times and greater harm  \n\n4 \n to institutions and the  broader financial system  when th e economic cycle reverses direction . If \nthere is one thing that we have lea rned from the current crisis it is that we  must have a strong set \nof rules in place to limit any erosion in regulatory standards over the cycle.  \nMy final con cern with principles -based regulation  is that  for it to be effective, regulators \nand firms must have consistent goals  and incenti ves. There must be mutual trust. Although I \nthink we would all like for this ideal to be attainable, we know in reality that it  is extremely \ndifficult to achieve.  \n Given the events that led to our  current crisis, it strikes me that we must reemphasize \nlongstanding and  proven rules -based standards to limit excessive risk -taking.  There must be  a \nfirm framework for enforcing and achieving our supervisory objectives.  \n \nBasel II  \nMany of the same issues surrounding principles -based regulation versus a rules -based \nsystem also apply to Basel II.  The main  “principle ” underlying the Bas el II framework  is that \ncapital requirements should be closely aligned with the risk assumed by the financial institution.  \nBasel II relies on  institutions making detailed assessment s of the risks they have assume d \nso a more precise capital requirement can be assigned.  Base l II, in fact, allows banks to use credit \nratings and their own internal  risk models to measure these risks and calculate  their capital needs . \nIn this regard, Basel II would  replac e a system that was based on  broad “risk buckets ” \nand a set of “ rules ” that determined what should go in these risk buckets and what capital would \nneed to be held against these specific risk -asset measures.   \nWhether this shift to a more principles -based capital framework under Basel II is \nbeneficial will depend on a number of the points that I noted  previously.   \n\n5 \n These points include:   \n Will the flexibility provided to banks in using their own risk models  lead to better \noutcomes , or will the y create greater  supervisor y enforcement and compliance \nproblems?   \n Will it be more difficult to get banks to build up and maintain higher levels of \ncapital during more prosperous times?   \n Can supervisors ensure that all banks operating under the Basel II framework \nfollow a consistent approach  in measuring capital needs?  \nThe difficulties with using models to measure risks are well -known to all of us . They \nhave become  painfully  apparent in the current financial crisis . Consequently,  we must be \ncautious in how we set capital requirements and limit financial leverage.  Models and credit \nratings don’t anticipate shifting risks very well.  \nModels calibrated during periods of stress can overestimate  risk and reinforce  the \nprocyclical effects of capital regulation.   \nEven m ore disastrous  are c alibrations performed during good times that can cause models \nto underestimate the risks of turbulent  conditions and leave banks holding insuff icient capital . An \nexample is provided by the experience of Britain’s Northern Rock.  At the time of its collapse, \nNorthern Rock had calculated that it had  substantial surplus capital under Basel II and was close \nto receiving regulatory approval to dividend out the “extra” capital to its shareholders . \nModels can fail to measure adequately a bank’s exposure to macroeconomic shocks and \nwill not measure risks n ot previously experienced.  For example, many risk models  clearly failed \nto anticipate the downturn in housing prices that  we have seen over the last several years.  A more \nspecific  example is the counterparties to AIG’s credit default swaps , who  took steps to protect \n\n6 \n themselves from credit risk by including collateral requirements in their swap contracts.  \nHowever, the counterparties did not anticipate that AIG’s o verall  risk would exceed the amount \nof collateral it could provide. Consequently, t he counterparties’ models did not indicate that \ncapital was needed for this exposure  or that the institutions should  shift their business away from \nAIG. \nAnother important problem is that models make enforcement of capital adequacy more \ndifficult.  Examiners mu st try to understand and evaluate very complex mathematical models , and \nwhen these model s appear to understate  capital needs , examiner s will have a difficult  time \narguing the technical merits of their views and convincing  bank management  of a need to add \ncapital . In too many cases, because management’s ROE depends on reducing capital, the result \nwill be insufficient capital and excessive bank leverage.  \nBanks have strong competitive and financial incentives to increase leverage.  Leverage \nincreases profitabil ity during good times, but it necessarily increases risk.  We have seen the \nbroad systemic effects of excessive leverage in the current environment.  In many ways, t he Basle \nII model -based capital regime provide s banks with a rationale , a defense  and an oppo rtunity  for \ntaking excessive leverage.  \nOverleveraging has been a major problem during the current market meltdown – both \namong the institutions now operating under Basel II and among those that will soon come under \nthis framework.  \nTo limit such problems in  the future, we must maintain limits on financial leverage \nthrough strict rules that set a minimum capital -to-assets ratio.  This type of rule would be the \neasiest , most equitable  and clear -cut way to set capital requirements for all sizes of banks and for  \na broader range of firms throughout our financial markets.  \n\n7 \n A leverage standard would also be much harder to evade than capital standards based on \nan ins titution’s own estimates of risk exp osure.  I am particularly concerned that institutions that \nunderesti mate their risk exposures under the Basel II framework will invariably hold less capital \nthan they need and be the first to have serious problems during a crisis.  Consequently , as we \ndiscuss how we might strengthen the Basel II framework today, I believe w e should also give \nattention to how we can underpin this approach with a strict rule on the amount of leverage an \ninstitution can assume.  While leverage requirements are not a panacea for supervising financial \nfirms, it is clear that if you want  to direct your resourc es to where  you are most likely to have \nproblems, you can direct them to the more highly leveraged and weakened  firms. \n \nA Resolution Framework for Institutions Deemed “Too Big to Fail”  \nFinally , this meeting will be looking at how we should deal  with institutions that are \nsystemi cally important or what many  call “too big to fail.”  Although discussions about \nsupervisory framework and capital regulation are vitally important, the idea that some \ninstitutions can be too big to fail , and thereby recei ve special treatment, is the most immediate \nconcern and the area where the actions so far have been most troubling .  \nThere are very real and rapidly escalating costs that are being absorbed by the  U.S. \ntaxpayers.  There are also some very important question s that, in the name of “urgen t,” have been \npushed to the side rather than addressed in a systematic fashion.  In recent weeks, you have seen \noutrage in the United  States  over bonuses paid to some employees of AIG, which has received \nsubstantial government funding . We must think through carefully the consequences of well -\nintentioned  but rushed decisions.  Although the extreme costs of the bailout have received much \n\n8 \n of the attention, there are other  fundamental questions about competitive fairness, capitalism and \nfinancial market s that must be considered as well .  \nIn the interest of time, I will raise  only one  example right now . Currently, the stock prices \nof some of these “too big to fail ” financial companies are trading for a fraction  of their pre -crisis \nlevels, although  billions of government dollars in the form of capital, loans and guarantees are \nbeing pump ed into these firms  to avoid either capital or liquidity insolvency . If the government  \nstays the current course  and it works, the stock prices will rise.  For a shareholder buying in at \ncurrent levels, a return to even half of what the shares traded at a couple of years ago could \ngenerate very large return s. So, not only are taxpayers picking up the tab for making these firms \nviable, they are also taking on an inordinate amount of the  risk and leaving the rewards for \nprivate investors.  And I suspect that as the markets become more confident that the government \nwill continue its support for “too big to fail,” the price of such shares will indeed bring hands ome \nreturns.    \nWith issues like this in mind, I recently gave a speech on this topic , titled , “Too Big Has \nFailed.” I would like to take a few moments to reiterate some of the key points  concerning how \nwe might  address this issue.  \nOne comparison I drew was  between Japan and Sweden.  As you may recall, Japan took a \nvery gradual and delayed approach in the 1990s to addressing its banking problems and put off \ndealing with a critical shortage of capital in its banks.  In contrast, after a severe real estate \ncolla pse in the early 1990s, Sweden took decisive steps to identify losses in its major financial \ninstitutions . The viable Swedish banks were soon recapitalized,  largely through private sources, \nand public authorities quickly took over two large insolvent banks  and spun off their bad assets \nto be managed withi n a separate entity. Sweden was able to quickly restore confidence in its \n\n9 \n financial system at little cost to taxpayers, while Japan continued  to have a weakened banking \nsystem for much of the 1990s.  \nAnother  important example  is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), which was \nused to deal with banking problems in t he United States in the 1930s. The RFC proved to be \nhighly successful in using public funds to recapitalize banks with no net cost to taxpa yers. This \nsuccess was based on the RFC’s adherence to a sound set of principles, beginning with writing \ndown the bad assets at a bank to realistic economic values and making any needed and \nappropriate changes in bank management before injecting public equ ity into the bank.  \nA final example is the failure of Continental Illinois National Bank in 1984.  Although \nContinental Illinois was essentially deemed “too big to fail” and was handled through an open \nbank assistance program , it showed that U.S. banking aut horities could take over a very large \nbank, replace its management and wipe out stockholders, and then restore the bank to sound \ncondition and return it to private ownership.  \nThere are several lessons that we can draw from these past experiences.  \n First, th e losses in the financial system won’t go away – they will only fester and \nincrease while impe ding our chances for a recovery.  \n Second, we must take a consistent, timely and specific approach to major \ninstitutions and their problems if we are to reduce mark et uncertainty and bring in \nprivate investors and market funding.  \n Third, if institutions – no matter what their size – have lost market confidence and \ncan’t survive on their own, we must be willing to write down their losses, bring in \ncapable management, s ell off and reorganize misaligned activities and businesses, \nand begin the process of restoring them to private ownership.  \n\n10 \n The question that supervisors in all countries must ask themselves is:  How can we best \nresolve problems at financial institutions tha t are deemed to be “too big to fail” ? \nOne guide to how we could proceed in the United States is the process we use for failing \nbanks.  This approach – albeit far from perfect in dealing with “too big to fail ” banks – has been \ndeveloped over time in response  to previous crises and deals with many of the issues that need to \nbe resolved in today’s environment.  \nOur bank resolution process focuses on timely action to protect depositors and limit \nspillover effects to the economy and the rest of the financial syste m. For instance, insured \ndepositors at failed banks typically receive immediate access to their funds, while uninsured \ndepositors often receive quick, partial payouts based on expected recoveries or , in systemic \ncircumstances , may be fully protected.  \nAlso,  we have a variety of means for resolving failed banks and ensuring a continuity of \nessential services, including selling all or part of a failed bank to a bank in sound condition or \noperating the bank under regulatory oversight through a bridge bank, cons ervatorship  or open \nbank assistance.  These options focus on bringing in capable management, while putting the \nshareholders at failed banks f irst in line to absorb losses. The FDIC, as receiver for failed banks, \nmust pursue the least costly option – except in systemic circumstances – in order to protect the \ndeposit insurance fund and taxpayers.  \nI support constructing a similar resolution program that we could apply consistently to all \n“too big to fail” institutions, including banks, bank and financial holdin g companies, and \nnonbank financial institutions.  \nWithout going into details, I think a resolution plan for “too  big to fail” institutions \nshould be based on several princip les. \n\n11 \n First, it must be equitable and consistent when compared to how other failing financial \ninstitutions and their customers are treated.  Giving any type of institution special treatment will \nundermine confidence in the fairness of the financial system, increase moral hazard problems \nand provide incentives for taking greater risk.  \nSecon d, a plan must ensure timely action to protect customers and provide for a \ncontinuity of essential financial services, much like many countries have done in giving \ndepositors at failed banks immediate access to all or a major portion of their funds.  I woul d also \nargue for establishing a clear priority for handling claims, with shareholders and large unsecured \ncreditors having to bear the full risk of the positions they have taken.  In addition , to prevent \ndelays and political interference, I believe it is im portant to have a source of public funds that \ncan be tapped for resolutions and for this resolution authority to be put largely under the control \nof independent supervisory agencies.  \nWhile some have criticized this type of approach on the grounds that we would be \n“nationalizing” our financial system and that regulators are ill -equipped to take over and operate  \na large institution, this is not what I believe or advocat e. \nResolving problems at failing institutions is something that public authorities have done \nmany times  in the past . While it may take more time to work out the problems at larger \ninstitutions and return them to private ownership, this is still a temporary step that would be \ntaken with a limited number of institutions.  Moreover, the experience of banking agencies in \ndealing with significant failures indicates that regulators are capable of bringing in qualified \nmanagement and finding specialized expertise when needed.  \nIf we don’t take decisive steps to resolve major banking problems, I believe w e will face \na much more serious set of issues.  In fact, leaving failing institutions to continue their operations \n\n12 \n with a failed management team in place is certain to prove  more costly in the long run and less \nlikely to restore public confidence and get us  back on the path to recovery.  \nFirms that rely on significant infusions of public funds have failed . We need to stop \npropping them up and start taking them apart in an orderly manner.  \n \nConclusion  \nBefore I conclude , I would like to make one final comment. There is no doubt that the \nmonths to come will be filled with talk about sweeping regulatory changes. The actions of the \nlast several months, rather than solving the problem, seem to have added only more questions t o \nthe debate. I hope, in this instance, instead of being led down a path of “urgent” action , we \ncareful ly consider solutions. In the United States , there is talk about the need for a financial \nstability regulator and who should fill that role. I believe th at the Federal Reserve, by design, has \nthat responsibility  and must start filling that role. Instead or rewriting the rule book, I think we \nneed to first enforce what is already there and do it in a fair and evenhanded manner that is not \ninfluenced by circ umstances we decide are “special” because of the nature of the problem or the \nsize of the firm involved.  \nThe current financial crisis is providing a very comprehensive test of our financial \nsystems a nd supervisory frameworks. W e are all  clearly interested in identifying what went \nwrong, what can we do to work our way out of today’s problems, and wha t we should do going \nforward . I am certainly looking forward to this meeting and hearing everyone’s views on the \nchallenges we face."

Hoenig \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n    \n     \nOmaha, Neb. \nMarch 6, 2009 \n \n\n \n \n2 \n Two years ago, we started seeing a problem in  a specialized area of financial markets \nthat many people had never heard of, known as th e subprime mortgage market.  At that time, \nmost policymakers thought the problems would be  self-contained and have limited impact on \nthe broader economy.  Today, we know differentl y. We are in the midst of a very serious \nfinancial crisis, and our econom y is under significant stress. \nOver the past year, the Federal government and financial policy makers have enacted \nnumerous programs and committed trillions of dolla rs of public funds to address the crisis.  \nAnd still the problems remain.  We have yet to  restore confidence and transparency to the \nfinancial markets, leaving le nders and investors wary of  making new commitments.   \nThe outcome so far, while disappoi nting, is perhaps not surprising. \nWe have been slow to face up to the funda mental problems in our financial system \nand reluctant to take decisive action with re spect to failing institutions.  We are slowly \nbeginning to deal with the overh ang of problem assets and management weaknesses in some \nof our largest firms that this cr isis is revealing.  We have been  quick to provide liquidity and \npublic capital, but we have not defined a consistent plan and not addressed basic \nshortcomings and, in some cases, the insolvent position of these institutions.  \nWe understandably would prefer not to “nat ionalize” these businesses, but in reacting \nas we are, we nevertheless are drifting into  a situation where in stitutions are being \nnationalized piecemeal with no resolution of the crisis. \nWith conditions deteriorating around us, I will offer my views on how we might yet \ndeal with the current state of a ffairs.  I’ll start with a brief overview of the policy actions we \nhave been pursuing, but I will also provide pers pective on the actions we have taken and the \noutcomes we have experienced in previous fi nancial crises.  Finall y, I will suggest what \n\n \n \n3 \n lessons we might take from these previous cr ises and apply to working our way out of the \ncurrent crisis. \nIn suggesting alternative solutions, I acknow ledge it is no simple matter to solve. \nPeople say “it can’t be done” when speaking of allowing large institutions to fail. But I don’t \nthink that those who managed the Reconstructi on Finance Corporation, the Resolution Trust \nCorporation, the Swedish financial crisis or a ny other financial crisis were handed a blueprint \nthat carried a guarantee of success.  I don’t accept that we have lo st our ability to solve a new \nproblem, especially when it looks like a familiar problem. \n \nCurrent Policy Actions and Problems \nMuch has been written about how we got in to our current situa tion, most notably the \nbreakdowns in our mortgage finance system, we ak or neglected risk management practices, \nand highly leveraged and interconnected firms and financial markets.  Because this has been \nwell-documented, today I will focus on the policy responses we have tried so far and where \nthey appear to be falling short.  \nA wide range of policy steps has been ta ken to support financial institutions and \nimprove the flow of credit to businesses and hous eholds.  In the interest of time, I will go \nover the list quickly. \nAs a means of providing liquidity to the financial system and the economy, the \nFederal Reserve has reduced the targeted federa l funds rate in a series of steps from 5.25 \npercent at mid-year 2007 to the present 0 to 25 basis-point range.  In addition, the Federal \nReserve has instituted a wide range of ne w lending programs and, through its emergency \nlending powers, has extended this lending beyond depository institutions. \n\n \n \n4 \n The Treasury Department, the Federal Rese rve and other regulators have also \narranged bailouts and mergers for large strugg ling or insolvent institutions, including Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, WaM u, Wachovia, AIG, Countrywide, and Merrill \nLynch.  But other firms, such as Lehman  Brothers, have been allowed to fail. \nThe Treasury has invested public funds, buying preferred stock in more than 400 \nfinancial institutions through the TARP program.  TARP money has also been used to fund \ngovernment guarantees of more than $400 billi on of securities held by major financial \ninstitutions, such as CitiGroup and Bank of Am erica.  In addition, the Federal Reserve and \nthe Treasury Department have committed more  than $170 billion to bail out the troubled \ninsurance company AIG.   \nOther actions have included increased deposit insurance limits and guarantees for \nbank debt instruments and m oney market mutual funds. \nThe most recent step is the Treasury financ ial stability plan, which provides for a new \nround of TARP spending and controls, assistance  for struggling homeowners, and a plan for \na government/private sector partnership to buy up bad assets held by financial institutions \nand others. \nThe sequence of these actions, unfortunate ly, has added to market uncertainty. \nInvestors are understandably watching to see which institutions will receive public money and survive as wards of the state. \nAny financial crisis leaves a stream  of losses embedded among the various \nparticipants, and these losses must ultimately be borne by someone.  To start the resolution \nprocess, management responsible for the problems  must be replaced and the losses identified \nand taken. Until these kinds of actions are taken,  there is little chance to restore market \n\n \n \n5 \n confidence and get credit  markets flowing.  It is not a que stion of avoiding these losses, but \none of how soon we will take them and get on to the process of recovery.  Economist Allan \nMeltzer may have expressed this point best when  he said that “capitalism without failure is \nlike religion without sin.”   \n \nWhat Might We Learn from Previous Financial Crises? \nMany of the policy actions I just describe d provide support to the largest financial \ninstitutions, those that are fre quently referred to as “too big to fail.” A rationale for such \nactions is that the failure of a large institution would have a systemic impact on the economy.  It is emphasized that markets have become mo re complex, and institutions – both bank and \nnonbank entities – are now larger and connected  more closely through a complicated set of \nrelationships.  Often, they point  to the negative impact on the economy caused by last year’s \nfailure of Lehman Brothers.   \nHistory, however, may show us another experience.  When examining previous \nfinancial crises, in other countries as well as in  the United States, large institutions have been \nallowed to fail. Banking authorities have  been successful in placing new and more \nresponsible managers and directors in charge and then reprivatizing them.  There is also \nevidence suggesting that countries that have tried to avoid taki ng such steps have been much \nslower to recover, and the ultimate cost to taxpayers has been larger.  \nThere are several examples that illustrate these points and show what has worked in \nprevious crises and what hasn’t.  A comparis on that many are starting to draw now is with \nwhat happened in Japan and Sweden. \n\n \n \n6 \n Japan took a very gradual and delayed appro ach in addressing the problems in its \nbanks.  A series of limited steps spread out over a number of years were taken to slowly \nremove bad assets from the banks, and Japan put off efforts to address an even more \nfundamental problem – a critical shortage of capital in these banks.  As a result, the banks \nwere left in the position of ha ving to focus on past problems with  little resources available to \nhelp finance any economic recovery. \nIn contrast, Sweden took decisive steps to  identify losses in its major financial \ninstitutions and insisted that solvent institut ions restore capital and clean up their balance \nsheets.  The Swedish government did provide lo ans to solvent institutio ns, but only if they \nalso raised private capital.  \nSweden dealt firmly with insolvent institu tions, including operating two of the largest \nbanks under governmental oversight with the goal of bringing in priv ate capital within a \nreasonable amount of time.  To deal with the ba d assets in these banks, Sweden created well-\ncapitalized asset management corporations or what we might call “bad banks.”  This step \nallowed the problem assets to be dealt with  separately and systematically, while other \nbanking operations continued under a tr ansparent and focused framework. \nThe end result of this approach was to restore confidence in the Swedish banking \nsystem in a timely manner and limit the amount of taxpayer losses.  Sweden, which \nexperienced a real estate decline more severe than that in the United States, was able to \nresolve its banking problems at a long term ne t cost of less than 2 percent of GDP.  \nWe can also learn a great deal from how the United States has dealt with previous \ncrises.  There has been a lot written attempting to draw para llels with the Great Depression. \n\n \n \n7 \n The main way that we dealt with str uggling banks at that time was through the \nReconstruction Finance Corporation. \nWithout going into great detail about the RF C, I will note the four principles that \nJesse Jones, the head of the RFC, employed in  restructuring banks.  The first step was to \nwrite down a bank’s bad assets to  realistic economic values.  Next, the RFC would judge the \ncharacter and capacity of bank ma nagement and make any needed and appropriate changes.  \nThe third step was to inject equity in the form  of preferred stock, but this step did not occur \nuntil realistic asset values and capable management were in place.  The final step was receiving the dividends and even tually recovering the par value of the stock as a bank \nreturned to profitability and full private ownership. \nAt one point in 1933, the RFC held capital in more than 40 percent of all banks, \nrepresenting one-third of total bank capital acco rding to some estimates, but because of the \nfour principles of Jesse Jones, this was all car ried out without any net cost to the government \nor to taxpayers.  \nIf we compare the TARP program to the RFC, TARP began without a clear set of \nprinciples and has proceeded with what seems to be an ad hoc and less-than-transparent \napproach in the case of banks judged “too big to fail.” In both the RFC and Swedish \nexperiences, triage was first used to set priori ties and determine what in stitutions should be \naddressed immediately. TARP treated the larges t institutions as one. As we move forward \nfrom here, therefore, we would be wise to have  a systematic set of principles and a detailed \nplan to guide us. \nAnother example we need to be aware of re lates to the thrift problems of the 1980s.  \nBecause the thrift insurance fund was inadequate to avoid the losses embedded in thrift \n\n \n \n8 \n balance sheets, an attempt was made to cover ove r the losses with net worth certificates and \nexpanded powers that were supposed to allow thrifts to grow out of their problems.  A \nnotable fraction of the thrift industry was insolvent, but cont inued to operate as so-called \n“zombie” or “living dead” thrifts.  As you may recall, this attempt to postpone closing insolvent thrifts did not end well,  but instead added greatly to the eventual losses and led to \ngreater real estate problems. \nA final example -- our approach to larg e bank problems in the 1980s and early 1990s \n-- shows that we have taken some steps to deal with banking or ganizations that are \nconsidered “too big to fail” or ve ry important on a regional level. \nThe most prominent example is Continental Illinois’ failure in 1984.  Continental was \nthe seventh-largest bank in th e country, the largest domestic  commercial and industrial \nlender, and the bank that popularized the phr ase “too big to fail.”  Questions about \nContinental’s soundness led to  a run by large foreign depositors in May of 1984. \nBut looking back, Continental actually was allowed to fa il.  Although the FDIC put \ntogether an open bank assistance plan and inject ed capital in the form of preferred stock, it \nalso brought in new management at the top le vel, and shareholders, who were the bank’s \nowners, lost their entire investment.  The FDIC  also separated the problem assets from the \nbank, which left a clean bank to be restructured  and eventually sold.  To liquidate the bad \nassets, the FDIC hired specialists to oversee the different categories of loans and entered into \na service agreement with Continental that pr ovided incentive compensation for its staff to \nhelp with the liquidation process.   \nA lesson to be drawn from Continental is that  even large banks can be dealt with in a \nmanner that imposes market discipline on ma nagement and stockholders, while controlling \n\n \n \n9 \n taxpayer losses.  The FDIC’s asset dispositi on model in Continental, which used incentive \nfees and contracts with outside specialists, al so proved to be an effective and workable \nmodel.  This model was employed again in th e failure of Bank of New England in 1991, the \nfailures of nearly all of the la rge banking organizations in Texa s in the 1980s, and also for the \nResolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to liquidate failed thrifts. \n \nResolving the Current Crisis  \nTurning to the current crisis , there are several lessons we can draw from these past \nexperiences.   \n• First, the losses in the financial syst em won’t go away – they will only fester \nand increase while impeding our chances for a recovery.   \n• Second, we must take a consistent, ti mely, and specific approach to major \ninstitutions and their problems if we  are to reduce market uncertainty and \nbring in private investors and market funding.   \n• Third, if institutions -- no matter what their size -- have lost market confidence \nand can’t survive on their own, we must be  willing to write down their losses, \nbring in capable management, sell off and reorganize misaligned activities and \nbusinesses, and begin the process of re storing them to private ownership. \nHow can we do this today in an era where we have to deal with systemic issues rising \nnot only from very large banks, but also from  many other segments of the marketplace?  I \nwould be the first to acknowledge  that some things have changed in our financial markets, \nbut financial crises continue to occur for th e same reasons as always – over-optimism, \n\n \n \n10 \n excessive debt and leverage ratios, and mis guided incentives and perspectives – and our \nsolutions must continue to address these basic problems. \nThe process we use for failing banks -- albeit  far from perfect in dealing with “too big \nto fail” banks -- provides some first insight into the principles  we should establish in dealing \nwith financial institutions of any type. \nOur bank resolution framework focuses on tim ely action to protect depositors and \nother claimants, while limiting spillover effects to the economy.  Insured depositors at failed banks typically gain full and immediate access to their funds, while uninsured depositors \noften receive quick, pa rtial payouts based on expected recoveries. \nTo provide for a continuation of essentia l banking services, the FDIC may choose \nfrom a variety of options, including purchase  and assumption transactions, deposit transfers \nor payouts, bridge banks, cons ervatorships, and open bank assi stance.  These options focus \non transferring important banking functions over to sound banking organizations with \ncapable management, while putting shareholders at failed banks first in line to absorb losses. \nOther important features in resolving failing banks include an esta blished priority for \nhandling claimants, prompt corrective action, an d least-cost resolution provisions to protect \nthe deposit insurance fund and, ultimately, taxpaye rs and to also bri ng as much market \ndiscipline to the pr ocess as possible. \nI would argue for constructing a defined resolution program for “too big to fail” \nbanks and bank holding companies, and nonbank fi nancial institutions. It is especially \nnecessary in cases where the normal bankruptcy process may be too slow or disruptive to \nfinancial market activities and relationships.  The program and resolution process should be \n\n \n \n11 \n implemented on a consistent, transparent and eq uitable basis whether we are resolving small \nbanks, large banks or other co mplex financial entities.   \nHow should we structure this resolution pro cess?  While a number of details would \nneed to be worked out, let me provide a broad outline of how it might be done. \nFirst, public authorities w ould be directed to declar e any financial institution \ninsolvent whenever its capital level falls t oo low to support its ongoing operations and the \nclaims against it, or whenever the market lose s confidence in the firm and refuses to provide \nfunding and capital.  This directiv e should be clearly stated and c onsistently adhered to for all \nfinancial institutions that are part of the in termediation process or payments system.  We \nmust also recognize up front th at the FDIC’s resources and other financial industry support \nfunds may not always be sufficient for this task and that Treasury money may also be \nneeded. \nNext, public authorities should use receive rship, conservatorship or “bridge bank” \npowers to take over the failing instituti on and continue its operations under new \nmanagement.  Following what we have done with banks, a receiver would then take out all or \na portion of the bad assets and either sell th e remaining operations to one or more sound \nfinancial institutions or arrange for the opera tions to continue on a bridge basis under new \nmanagement and professional oversight.  In th e case of larger institutions with complex \noperations, such bridge operations would need to  continue until a plan can be carried out for \ncleaning up and restructuring the fi rm and then reprivatizing it. \nShareholders would be forced to bear the fu ll risk of the positions they have taken and \nsuffer the resulting losses.  The newly restructur ed institution would c ontinue the essential \nservices and operations of the failing firm.   \n\n \n \n12 \n All existing obligations woul d be addressed and dealt with according to whatever \npriority is set up for handling claims.  Th is could go so far as providing 100 percent \nguarantees to all liabilities, or , alternatively, it could include  resolving short-term claims \nexpeditiously and, in the case of uninsured cl aims, giving access to maturing funds with the \npotential for haircuts depending on expected recoveries, any co llateral protection and likely \nmarket impact. \nThere is legitimate concern for addressing these issues when institutions have \nsignificant foreign operations. Howe ver, if all liabilities are guar anteed, for example, and the \ninstitution is in receivership, such inte rnational complexities could be addressed \nsatisfactorily.  \nOne other point in resolving “too big to fa il” institutions is that public authorities \nshould take care not to worsen our exposure to such institutions  going forward.  In fact, for \nfailed institutions that have proven to be too big or too complex to manage well, steps must \nbe taken to break up their operati ons and sell them off in more manageable pieces.  We must \nalso look for other ways to limit the creation a nd growth of firms that  might be considered \n“too big to fail.” \nIn this regard, our recent e xperience with ad hoc solutions  to large failing firms has \nled to even more concentrated financial market s as only the largest ins titutions are likely to \nhave the available resources fo r the type of hasty takeovers that have occurred.  Another \ndrawback is that these organi zations do not have the time fo r necessary “due diligence” \nassessments and, as we have seen, may enc ounter serious acquisition problems.  Under a \nmore orderly resolution process, public authorities would have th e time to be more selective \n\n \n \n13 \n and bring in a wider group of bidders, and they would be able  to offer all or portions of \ninstitutions that have been  restored to sound conditions. \n \nConcluding Thoughts   \nWhile hardly painless and with much comple xity itself, this approach to addressing \n“too big to fail” strikes me as constructive a nd as having a proven track record.  Moreover, \nthe current path is beset by ad hoc decisi on making and the potential for much political \ninterference, including efforts to force probl em institutions to le nd if they accept public \nfunds; operate under other imposed controls; and limit management pay, bonuses and severance.   \nIf an institution’s management has failed the test of the marketplace, these managers \nshould be replaced.  They should not be given public funds and then micro-managed, as we \nare now doing under TARP, with a set of political strings attached.  \nMany are now beginning to criticize the idea of public authoritie s taking over large \ninstitutions on the grounds that we would be “n ationalizing” our financ ial system.  I believe \nthat this is a misnomer, as we are taking a temporary step that is  aimed at cleaning up a \nlimited number of failed institutions and return ing them to private ownership as soon as \npossible.  This is something that the banking agencies have done many times before with smaller institutions and, in selected cases, w ith very large institutions.  In many ways, it is \nalso similar to what is typical ly done in a bankruptcy court, but with an emphasis on ensuring \na continuity of services.  In c ontrast, what we have been doing  so far is every bit a process \nthat results in a protracted nationalizati on of “too big to fail” institutions.    \n\n \n \n14 \n The issue that we should be most concer ned about is what approach will produce \nconsistent and equitable outcomes and will get us back on the path to recovery in the quickest \nmanner and at reasonable cost.  While it may take us some time to clean up and reprivatize a large institution in today’s envi ronment -- and I do not intend to  underestimate the difficulties \nthat would be encountered -- the alternative of leaving an institu tion to continue its \noperations with a failed management team in pla ce is certain to be more costly and far less \nlikely to produce a desirable outcome. \nIn a similar fashion, some are now claimi ng that public authorit ies do not have the \nexpertise and capacity to take ove r and run a “too big to fail” in stitution.  They contend that \nsuch takeovers would destroy a firm’s inherent value, give talented employees a reason to \nleave, cause further financial panic and require many years for the restru cturing process.  We \nshould ask, though, why would anyone assume we are better off leaving an institution under \nthe control of failing managers, dealing with th e large volume of “toxic” assets they created \nand coping with a raft of politically imposed  controls that would be placed on their \noperations? \nIn contrast, a firm resolution process could be placed unde r the oversight of \nindependent regulatory agencies whenever pos sible and ideally would be funded through a \ncombination of Treasury and financial industry funds. \nFurthermore, the experience of the banking agencies in dealing with significant \nfailures indicates that financial regulators ar e capable of bringing in qualified management \nand specialized expertise to restore failing in stitutions to sound health.  This rebuilding \nprocess thus provides a means of restoring value to an institution, while creating the type of \nstable environment necessary to maintain and attract talented employees.  Regulatory \n\n \n \n15 \n agencies also have a proven track record in  handling large volumes of problem assets – a \nrecord that helps to ensure that resolutions are handled in a way that best protects public \nfunds. \nFinally, I would argue that creating a framework that ca n handle the failure of \ninstitutions of any size will restore an important  element of market discipline to our financial \nsystem, limit moral hazard concerns, and assure the fairness of treatment from the smallest to \nthe largest organizations that that is  the hallmark of our economic system."

        "content": "The U.S. Economic Outlook: \nThe Aftermath of Leverage \n \n           \nThomas M. Hoenig \nPresident \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n             \nThe Central Exchange \nKansas City, Missouri \nJanuary 7, 2009 \n \n\n \n 2\nI am pleased to once again be at the Cent ral Exchange to share my outlook for the \neconomy.  It doesn’t seem possible that it ha s been a year since I last spoke here and \nsuggested that though the econom y was going to slow, there wa s still the po ssibility of \navoiding a recession.  I thought we might a void the recession if the housing market \nstabilized and the financial sector  avoided further shocks.     \nThe sad truth is that over the past year, the economy has been affected by several \nshocks – the further decline in housing, the tu rmoil in financial markets, and a sharp drop \nin consumer and business confidence. With th e benefit of hindsight, we should not be all \nthat surprised by the onset of these shocks. They are a conse quence of excessive leverage \naccumulated over a decade, about which many of us expressed concerns.   \nThe remedy to what we now face will requi re a rebalancing of domestic savings \nand investment within the U.S. economy. Th is rebalancing process and the length and \ndepth of the recession itself will be determ ined importantly by how quickly financial \nfirms, businesses and the consumer rebuild their diminished wealth and regain their \nconfidence.  It will be influenced also by the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented actions \nand funding programs and forthcomi ng fiscal initiatives.    \nThese are challenging times to say the leas t, and for the next few minutes, I want \nto share with you my perspective on them.  I will start with some background on what led \nto this recession and then describe for you my outlook for 2009.  I also will provide what \ninformation I can on the policy actions being ta ken to influence this outlook.  And let me \nsay at the outset that though I agree we must do all we r easonably can to revive the \neconomy, I caution, based on my years of experien ce, that in our haste to mitigate this \nrecession’s effects, we not attempt shortcuts that  put at risk future stability and growth.   \n\n \n 3\nThe U.S. Economy is in Recession \n The U.S. recession, we are told by the NB ER, officially began more than a year \nago in December 2007.  In the third quarter of 2008, real GDP growth was -0.5 percent, \nand recent data suggests that the economy contra cted at a much sharpe r rate in the fourth \nquarter.  Labor markets have weakened considerably throughout the year.  The unemployment rate has risen from 4.9 pe rcent in January 200 8 to 6.7 percent in \nNovember, and total employment has fallen by 1.8 million jobs.  And, as evidenced by \nthe November employment report and recent layoff announcements, the deterioration in labor markets has intensified.  Worse yet, economic growth has slowed sh arply in the rest of the world.  Several \nEuropean countries along with Japan appear to be in recession.  As gr owth in the rest of \nthe world slows, so does demand for U.S. expor ts, which was the one bright spot in the \nU.S. economy in 2008. \nFinally, as is usually the case with recession, inflation has moderated considerably \nin recent months.  After surging in the ear lier half of 2008, the head line price indexes fell \nsharply in October and November due to the steep fall in energy pr ices. Core inflation \nalso moderated following weak consumer demand and declining production costs from \nlower energy and commodity prices.  But wh ile inflation is receding for the moment, I \nmust remind you that monetary policy is extremely accommodative, and if it remains so too long, as history suggests it may, inflation pressures could re-emerge as the economy \nrecovers.  \n \n\n \n 4\nFinancial Leverage \n It seems so clear now, doesn’t it, th at the key factor underlying the current \neconomic downturn has been the behavior of financial institutions  and consumers, who \nincreased their borrowing to unprecedented a nd ultimately unsustainable levels in the \nexcitement of the “boom” in housing.  As the r eality of this leverage finally emerged, its \neffects started to show most notably in A ugust 2007.  An asset-pricing crisis eventually \nwidened into a confidence crisis th at spread throughout the economy.   \nBetween 2001 and 2007, in an environment of low and then slowly rising interest \nrates and easy credit availability, financial institutions dramatica lly increased their \npackaging and selling of mortgages in respons e to increased demand for these securitized \nassets.  During this period of rapidly rising real estate prices , these assets were judged to \nbe safe, profitable investments.   \nIn addition, we saw a surge in debt. Fi nancial firms increased the level of \ndomestic financial debt from $8.5 trillion to $16 trillion, or by 90 percen t.  Mortgage debt \nincreased from $4.9 trillion to $10.5 trillion, a 114 percent in crease.  And total public \ndebt outstanding increased from  $3.4 trillion to $5.2 trillion.   The building of assets \nthrough the use of debt was the way to easy wealth, so it seemed.   \nWhen the rise in real estate prices stalled in late 2006, investors became \nincreasingly concerned about th e value of these securitized, le veraged assets.  In August \n2007, the financial crisis emerged, full force, as short-term lending began to seize up.   \nThe firms most strongly affected by these events were, of cour se, those that “took \nadvantage” of one of the most aggressive leveraging periods in fi nancial history.  The \ndebt-to-capital ratios for the largest 10 ba nk holding companies in aggregate increased \n\n \n 5\nover the past ten years from about 14 to 1 to over 21 to 1.  The debt-t o-capital ratios for \nthe investment banks were even higher at over 30 to 1.   \nThe crisis that emerged as the implications  of this leverage became more apparent \nresembled an old-style bank run.  As problem s developed and confidence waned many of \nthese institutions found themselves without funding.  They were unable to sell their \nsecurities in the market give n the concerns about the value of the underlying assets.  \nThese events caused a broad base of participan ts to pull out of the markets to the point \nwhere they no longer function properly.   \nThe resolution of the crisis will occur when the deleveraging process hits bottom \nand financial institutions are able to resume thei r role as intermediaries.  This I suspect is \ndependent on at least two factors.   \nFirst, a stable market price needs to be es tablished for the currently illiquid assets \nsitting on the balance sheets of financial institu tions.  Until these assets can be adequately \nvalued and losses absorbed and future losses staunched, financial firms are going to have \na difficult time raising capital and extending new loans.   \nSecond, this will take time and will not be painless or simple to accomplish.  It \nwill require actions by both the monetary and fiscal authorities that are well thought out, \nwell-defined, fully disclosed, and firmly and consistently executed across all financial \nfirms.  We have learned from events over th is past year that this is no easy task. \n \n   \n\n \n 6\nConsumer Leverage \n A related event having substa ntial negative repercussions for the U.S. economy is \nthe fallout from the leveraging of U.S. consumers.  Between 2001 and 2007, household debt increased from 97 percent of disposab le personal income to 133 percent.  This \nmassive increase in borrowing was reflect ed most vividly through the increase of \nmortgage debt.  The mortgage refinancing boom allowed homeowners to extract large \nquantities of equity from their homes at a time when house prices were appreciating \nrapidly. The overall result was that consumer s spent at a rate roughly equal to their \nincomes, savings rates plunged to zero and borrowing soared.   \nMuch of this borrowing was funded by foreigners.  Between 2001 and 2007, the \ncurrent account deficit increased by 56 percent as our demand for imports greatly exceeded exports.  Foreign holdings of total U.S. Treasury debt increased sharply from \n30 percent to 46 percent.  Thus, while the Un ited States spent, the rest of the world \nsupported our habit.  Now we’re in wit hdrawal, and, yes, it is painful.   \nIn the past two years, household wealth has fallen sharply with declines in house \nprices and equity values.  For example, homeowners’ equity share of household real \nestate has dropped from 55 percent to 45 pe rcent, the lowest value on record.  To \nrebalance and rebuild wealth, consumers are now increasing savings and decreasing \nspending.  As I said, this is a difficult process, and without offsetting adjustments in other \nsectors of the economy, the effect of this reba lancing is slower growth in real GDP.   \n \n  \n\n \n 7\nThe Aftermath of Leverage  \nIn the first half of 2008, the necessary st ructural adjustment began gradually.  \nReal GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent while consumption grew at the slower \nrate of 1.0 percent.  Over the last several years export growth was strong and the real net \nexport deficit decreased.  For a while at least it seemed we mi ght come through the \nadjustment relatively well.  I cer tainly thought it was possible.   \nBut, then, mortgage foreclosure problems  worsened.  In early 2008, Bear Stearns \ncollapsed, followed later by a series of liquidi ty and solvency crises involving the GSEs, \nLehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and AIG.  Fo r investors, there was confusion regarding \nhow each was handled and how future problem s might finally be resolved. The TARP \nwas introduced and changed several times  as it was being implemented.     \nThese events added to uncertainty acro ss the economy, and the financial turmoil \nworsened.  In September and October, credit conditions tightened further, and businesses’ \nand consumers’ confidence seemed to collap se.  Indeed, although th e early attempts to \nstaunch the recession were well -intentioned, it will be a subj ect of debate for some time \non whether the rush to action might have cont ributed to the worsen ing of conditions.   \nIn the meantime, these developments c ontributed to the sh arp decline of 3.8 \npercent in consumption in the third quarter.  And for the first time ever, the level of \nhousehold debt declined.  Based on recent i ndicators, this decline in consumption \ncontinued into the fourth quarter and has served to deepen the recession.   \n \n  \n\n \n 8\nThe Outlook  \n The process of absorbing financial lo ss, increasing savings  and decreasing \nconsumption, the pain of deleveraging, sets  the context for the economic outlook. The \nhard fact is that the sharp deterioration of banking and credit conditions, the deepening \nslump in consumer and business confiden ce, and the ongoing housing correction must \nwork its way through the economy.  While we  must do what we can to mitigate the \neffects of this deleveraging process, to attemp t to avoid its effects entirely is to repeat \npast mistakes and may sow the seeds for the next crisis.   \n Accordingly, my outlook calls for the ec onomy to contract further through much \nof 2009 until later in the year when the effects of policy actions begin to stimulate GDP \ngrowth.  \nStarting with consumption, we will most lik ely see a contraction at least into the \nsecond quarter.  Improvements in both consumption and savings will be hampered by \ndeclines in disposable incomes as firms c ontinue to cut costs th rough layoffs, reductions \nof hours and pay cuts.  This will be particularly hard felt by households this month when the seasonal jobs during the holiday  shopping season come to an end.   \nThe outlook for business spending is also weak.  Conditions in the manufacturing \nsector have worsened, and with this, the dec line in corporate profits  makes it unlikely that \nfirms will expand equipment spending until they see a rebound in consumer demand.  Spending on structures is expect ed to contract markedly due to tight credit conditions and \nwaning demand for commercial building space.    Of course, the outlook for residential inve stment remains weak as well.  Housing \nstarts have fallen by 60 percent from peak levels in 2006, and the inventory of existing \n\n \n 9\nsingle-family homes remains unusually high at an 11.5-month supply. The increase in \nforeclosure rates in the near term is like ly to contribute to additional housing price \ndeclines.  Even the one recent source of strength for the economy, net exports, is expected to slow in 2009.  After a robust expansion of U.S. exports in the first half of 2008, a rapid \nappreciation of the dollar combined with weakening wo rld demand likely halted the \nexpansion of exports in the second half of the year.  The recent decline in the dollar \nshould reverse this somewhat, but world de mand is likely to be weak over the next \nseveral quarters.    Government spending at the state and local  level is expected to slow as budgets \nare cut in response to a dec line in tax revenues during th is downturn.  Government \nspending at the national level will provide a boost to the economy, depending on the size \nand content of the forthcom ing stimulus package.   \n Putting all of the pieces of the outlook toge ther, the picture for the last quarter of \n2008 and at least the first half of this year is grim.  The magnitude of the downturn is \nlikely to surpass that of the 1990 and 2001 recessions.    While this immediate outlook is unsettli ng, over the longer horizon there is reason \nto expect that we can move through these difficulties and be a stronger economy when \nwe emerge from recession.  If we pursue sy stematic policies with the right balance of \nmonetary and fiscal stimul us, the early signs of economic recovery could show \nthemselves as early as the third quarter of  2009.  It would be foolish to attempt to \npinpoint the exact spark for the recovery, but  there are important factors that should \ncontribute to this result.   \n\n \n 10\nFirst, the recent sharp decline in oil a nd gasoline prices does  increase consumer \ndisposable income by billions of dollars, improve their financial position and serve to restore confidence.  Second, while the housi ng market will continue to struggle, low \nmortgage rates and some decline in invent ory will serve to st abilize home prices and \nmoderate housing’s extended drag on the economy.  Third, a gradual improvement in \nfinancial conditions will increase the s upply of credit and encourage demand.  And \nfinally, expansive monetary and fiscal policy will stimulate the economy and serve to offset some of thos e factors pulling it down. \n Inflation will remain moderate over 2009 and much of 2010.  Lower energy and commodity prices along with moderate impr ovement in demand for goods and services \nwill keep price pressures temporarily c ontained.  How prices behave beyond the \nimmediate horizon depends most critically on how the Federal Reserve conducts policy and manages its expanding balance sheet in  a strengthening economy.  This is no doubt \nthe central bank’s most di fficult longer-run challenge. \n \nMonetary Policy \n As I already have suggested, the FO MC has responded to the financial and \neconomic crisis by steadily cutting the federal funds target rate from 5¼ percent in September 2007 to its current range between 0 and ¼ percent.    \nIn addition, to provide continued support for the functioning of financial markets \nand to stimulate the economy, the Board of Governors, under provisions of the Federal \nReserve Act, has authorized the creation of several new liquidity facilities and the FOMC \nhas authorized the purchase of large quantities of additional assets for the Reserve Banks \n\n \n 11\nto hold.  The Federal Reserve has stated that with near-term inflation pressures \ndiminished, it is prepared to provide expanded liquidity to th e markets as needed.  Plans \ninclude implementing a loan program to facil itate the extension of  credit to consumers \nand small businesses. \nThese actions are unprecedented and are a powerful stimulus to the economy for \n2009, but they come with their own set of risks.   First, they are not designed to fix the \nproblems within the financia l industry but to go around the problem.  They were taken \nbecause the intermediation process is broken, and financial institutions are thought to be \nin such a state that they are unable to expand their lending sufficiently to drive the \neconomic recovery forward.   \nAs a result, the Federal Reserve is not only providing liquidity to the financial \nindustry, it is also taking on the financial industry’s role as intermediary to business \nfirms.  This is a dramatic expansion of th e central bank’s role in  the economy.  It is \nreflected most vividly in the combined bala nce sheet of the 12 Re serve Banks, which has \nincreased from $900 billion in mostly Treas ury securities in the fall of 2007 to $2.3 \ntrillion in other assets today, and this will increase still further in the months ahead.   \nThe Federal Reserve must now manage its balance sheet in a manner that not only \nplaces liquidity into the economy but also in  a manner that does not undermine the long-\nterm functioning of markets.  It must design an exit strategy that at the appropriate time \nboth removes excess liquidity from the ec onomy and allows it to withdraw as a \nsignificant intermediary.  Failure to have su ch a strategy risks undermining an efficient \nfinancial market system.   \n\n \n 12\nSome of these facilities w ill automatically dissipate as the market’s intermediation \nprocess returns to a more normal state.  Bu t the Federal Reserve also will have to \nundertake specific, timely actions if we ar e to remove the acco mmodative policy in an \neffective manner.  The importance of doing th is correctly cannot be overemphasized.  As \nI have suggested, we have sometimes been slow to remove our accommodative policy, and in doing so, we have invited the ne xt round of inflation, excess and crisis. \n \nFiscal Policy \nFinally, a critical element affecting the recovery in 2009 will be the introduction \nof additional fiscal stimulus into the economy.  To this poi nt, the current administration \nand Congress have taken actions to recapitalize banks, and the FDIC has greatly expanded its guarantees of bank liabilities.  Bu t these actions might be viewed best as \nholding actions, designed to keep the economy fro m deteriorating furthe r and faster while \nother solutions are developed.  The incoming administration’s stimulus package appears \nto involve expenditures for both s hort-term and longer-term projects. \n The cost of the proposed actions is expected to exceed $700 billion and will \nalmost certainly boost the economy in a time of  recession.  In the longer run, as we know, \nthis too brings risks that cannot be ignored.  It will a dd to our burden of managing a \nrapidly expanding national debt at the same time that we will be confronted with the \nlooming obligations from rising Social Securi ty, Medicare and defens e expenditures.  But \nfor the moment, putting our economy back on it s feet is the priority, and with the \nmonetary and fiscal actions that are underway, we should see improvement as we enter \nthe second half of 2009.   \n\n \n 13\n \nConcluding Comments \n In the end, the greatest challenge that I see for the U.S. ec onomy is not just the \nrecession we are now suffering through but how we choose to address it.  There are no \nshortcuts to stability, no painless methods to adjusting our saving-spending mix and \nreturning to prosperity.  We want to succe ssfully get through this difficult deleveraging \nprocess, rebuild our national savings and wea lth, and we want to do it in a fashion that \ndoes not sow the seeds of the next crisis.  As we provide needed liquidity to the financial \nsystem to contain the crisis, we must be careful to build public confidence by assuring \nthat our actions across financial firms are consistent, open, and understandable to the \nmarket and the public.  We also must be pa tient and consider the long run.  We must \nprovide for an environment of stable prices and manageable debt levels so necessary for \nsustainable growth in our national income.  If  we fail to meet this mandate, we will only \nrepeat the cycle of inflation, excess and crisis."
