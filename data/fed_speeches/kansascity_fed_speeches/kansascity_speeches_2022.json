The consideration of differences across \nindividuals, industries, and geographies within an economy is particularly relevant for  \npolicymakers today as central banks a round  the world confront high inflation and tighten policy.   \nAs the depth of research at th is conference suggest s, the study of heterogeneity and \nmacroeconomics is a rich and active field.  Models incorporating heterogeneity are necessarily  \ncomplex, but as this conference has highlighted , progress  has been made in recent years.  That \nsaid, and perhaps as a consequence  of the complexity of the models, the importance of \nheterogeneity can often appear to be overlooked in macroeconomics . In my experience as a \ncentral banker , regardless of the state of the academic literature, it has long played an important \nrole in policym aking and continues to do so today.    \nFrom the perspective of the United States , one could argue that the structure of the \nFederal Reserve System itself is recognition  of the importance of heterogeneity.  In establishing \n12 distinct regional  banks, the Federal Reserve Act recognized  that it was important to monitor a \ndiversity of conditions across the nation  and to ensure that a range of communities were \nconnected to the central bank . Monetary policy can affect industries and populations  differently, \nand for a country like the United States, which has a history of skepticism surrounding \ncentralized authority, it is critical for diverse regions of the country to have a voice in the making \nof policy.  \nThe benefits of a central bank that is engaged  with diverse stakeholders are also evident \nin the Federal Reserve’s  focus on local and targeted outreach and engagement  with communities \nacross the country . For example, at the Kansas City  Fed we hold regular symposiums, \nroundtables, and advisory g roup meetings with representatives from diverse industries, \ngeographies , and cultural and economic backgrounds.  Perhaps most well -known  have been our \nFed Listens events where the Federal Reserve welcomes voices from a wide range of \norganizations  — unions, small business  owners , residents of low - and moderate -income \ncommunities, Native American leaders,  and others  — to hear how monetary policy affects them \nand their  local  communities. In addition, each Reserve Bank is governed by a Bo ard of Directors \nthat is representative of the range of community, business,  and labor interests in their region. It is \nat this regional  level where the central bank build s trust and enhances communicati on in ways \n\n \n2 \n  \nthat resonate across a range of audiences. In this regard, heterogeneity is central to the way the \nFederal Reserve operates.  \nI will focus  today  on two additional aspects of heterogeneity and monetary policy. First, \nhow it affects the conduct of monetary po licy, as distributional differences obscured by \naggregate measures can be important for how we interpret the data and inform  policy decisions. \nAnd second, how the conduct of monetary policy can affect heterogeneity, as monetary policy \ncan have distribution al consequences by affecting different segments of the population with \nvarying intensity.   \n \nThe Importance of Looking Within  Aggregates  \nStarting with the importance of heterogeneity in the conduct of monetary policy, let me \noffer  a very real and current ex ample  from the United States’ experience . During the pandemic, \nthe United States adopted an extraordinary fiscal stimulus, roughly $6 trillion, a large proportion \nof which consisted of direct transfers to households and businesses. Relative to previous \nprograms, the pandemic stimulus was distributed widely across the economy and , consequently , \nled to a sharp improvement in household balance sheets, with households estimated to have \naccumulated roughly $2. 3 trillion in excess saving s relative to pre -pandemic levels.1 \nAs the Fed tightens monetary policy with the aim of closing the imbalance between \ndemand and supply that has pushed up inflation, the dynamics of th ese excess savings and the \ndistribution of th ese saving s will be key fac tors shaping the outlook for output, inflation,  and \ninterest rates.  Higher saving s provide an important buffer to households that can ease the \nadjustment to economic disruptions.  However, high sav ings could also provide a further impetus \nto consumption as the central bank attempts  to slow the pace of demand growth . Higher saving s \ncould lessen a precautionary pullback in consumption , and it could well take a higher interest \nrate for some time to convince households to hold onto their saving s rather than spen d them  \ndown and add to inflationary pressure.   \nHow saving s affects the outlook is going to be importantly affected by the distribution of \nthese excess saving s across households.  Heterogeneity is going to matter.  If the se saving s are \nconcentrated in the upper brackets of the wealth distribution, a group that tends to spend a \n \n1 Aditya Aladangady, David Cho, Laura Feiveson and Eugenio Pinto. “ Excess Savings during the COVID -19 \nPandemic .” FEDS Notes . Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Oct. 21, 2022.  \n\n \n3 \n  \nsmaller share of their wealth and income, higher saving s might provide little additional \nmomentum to consumption.  However, if saving s are spread more evenly acros s the population, \nincluding households with a higher propensity to spend out of wealth, then the effect on the \npersistence of consumption is likely to be larger.   \nCurrently, available data suggests that saving s remain elevated across the wealth \ndistributio n. However, recent evidence also suggests that lower -income households are running \ndown their buffers quickly.  This is to say that monitoring the distribution of saving s is likely to \nbe important as we think about the course of the economy and the path of policy.  \nWhile high savings  are likely to provide momentum to consumption and require higher \ninterest rates , the fact that households are wealthier, less financially constrained,  and better \ninsured  is a positive development . Even so , bringing down inflation will require incentivizing  \nsaving s over consumption . The short -run pain from monetary contraction is lowest when demand \nmoderation  is progressive across the income distribution. Moderat ing demand growth  by \nencouraging high -income households to sa ve more with higher interest rates  would certainly be \npreferable  to crashing the consumption of lower -income households.  \nAcknowledging heterogeneity can also improve our understanding of the  forces \ncontributing to elevated inflation . Overall wage growth re mains strong, reflecting what by many \nmeasures has been a historically tight labor market.  With inflation recently rotating from goods \nto services prices, as supply chain disruptions ease and the labor market remains tight, \nunderstanding wage growth is lik ely to be important for understanding the overall path of \ninflation.   \nNominal wage growth for the median worker is tracking at 6 percent according to the \nAtlanta Fed’s Wage Tracker, but this aggregate number masks an importan t difference between \njob stayers and job movers. The median worker who switches jobs sees 7. 3 percent wage growth, \nwhich is substantially higher than those who stay put at their current job. Furthermore, the rate at \nwhich people switch jobs has increased si gnificantly, especially for prime -age workers, whose \naverage tenure at their current job fell by about three  months from 2020 to 2022. With labor \nmarkets historically tight, a calmer labor market with fewer quits and less churn could lower job \nswitching an d reduce inflationary pressures by lowering nominal wage growth.  \nAdditionally, the first half of 2022 saw a substantial reduction in average labor \nproductivity. If weaker labor markets force people to stay put longer, then they may become \n\n \n4 \n  \nmore proficient , and labor productivity growth may provide some inflationary relief in the near \nterm. In addition, many of my District contacts report problems with low worker engagement, \nwhich is a drag on productivity. If workers who no longer see their current job as replaceable  \nbecome more engaged, they may also become more productive.  \n \nThe Distributional Effects of Monetary Policy  \nTurning to the differential effects of monetary policy on heterogeneous groups , we \nshould understand that  our policies affect different gro ups in different ways.  Central bankers  are \nlargely constrained to using blunt tools, limiting the ability to fine -tune monetary policy . Still, \nthere are potential distributional consequences of central bank policies .  \nFor example, in the United States, e ven after some recent declines, house prices in the \nremain 25 percent above their pre -pandemic trend. This is partly , though certainly not wholly,  \ndue to the magnitude and duration of quantitative easing implemented by the Fed from 2020  \nthrough 20 22, especially the purchase of $1.4 trillion in mortgage -backed securities. Though the \ngoal of these  purchases was not to explicitly support house prices, it likely  had such an effect . \nHow are the benefits of supporting house prices distributed? People who  already own houses, \nwho tend to be wealthier and older, certainly gain. However, their gain may be at the expense of \nothers  who cannot get their foot in the door when prices are extremely high, even if rates are also \nlow. Loan-to-income and loan-to-value limits on mortgages are more likely to bind for people \nwithout large down payments , such as  young people at the beginning of their careers , and others  \nwith relatively low incomes.  \nTo close , heterogeneity matters for monetary policy , both in h ow we interpret the data \nand think about the outlook , as well as in the effect that our policy actions have on  the economy . \nAcknowledg ing that policy can affect diverse groups  differently is an important piece of building \nand maintaining central bank credi bility.  While it is tempting to simplify our analysis through  \naggregate measures, we should always be aware of the importance of individuals in setting the \ncourse for the economy and in bearing the consequences of policy  decisions."

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nNovember 10, 2022\nDelivered at “Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape,” a conference hosted by the\nFederal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas\nHouston, Texas\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System,\nits governors, officers, or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for attending the seventh annual Energy Conference, hosted by the Kansas\nCity and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks.\nEnergy is often in the spotlight given its central role in the economy, but the events of\nthis past year have only further reinforced the importance of energy to our region, the economy,\nand the backdrop for conducting monetary policy. Today I will offer an outlook for the U.S.\neconomy and my views on monetary policy. I’ll set the stage for those perspectives by looking\nfirst at the impact of developments in energy markets.\nEnergy Prices on the Rise\nEnergy prices have been on a wild ride this year. Brent crude oil ran up above $120 a\nbarrel mid-year before falling back to $95 a barrel. Even at the lower level, it is more than 10\npercent higher than the price a year ago and far above the roughly $60 a barrel average price that\nheld over the five years prior to the pandemic. The moves in natural gas prices have been even\nmore dramatic, with domestic natural gas prices doubling through the middle of this year, before\nretreating to a level below where they were last October (and even briefly falling below zero at\none trading hub in recent weeks). However, like oil, natural gas prices remain far above prepandemic averages.\nSimilar to higher prices in the broader economy, the increase in energy prices primarily\nreflects a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. Resurgent demand following the\nfading of pandemic lockdowns has run into a constrained supply side. Somewhat surprisingly,\nthe oil and gas extraction and petroleum products industries have shown the least recovery of any\nsector in the U.S. economy, both producing at about 60 percent of pre-pandemic levels. This is\neven worse than the supply-chain addled motor vehicle dealer sector, where output is running at\nabout 70 percent of pre-pandemic levels. The imbalance between supply and demand in the oil\nand gas sectors has unsurprisingly pushed up prices.\nOf course, the increase in prices is not solely due to lagging production in the United\nStates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended the entire global system of energy trade, not\njust for oil, but for almost every form of energy. Russia accounts for more than 10 percent of\nglobal oil exports, close to 20 percent of global natural gas exports, and about 15 percent of\nglobal coal exports—with Europe being its primary market. This heavy reliance pushed\nEuropean natural gas prices to historic highs, and the economic consequences of the energy\n1\n\n\fsupply shock are likely be sizeable for European economies. In addition to the disruption of\ntrade, sanctions are likely to dent global production. The International Energy Agency estimates\na potential loss of 2 percent of world oil supply as sanctions hit Russian production.\nHowever, it is important to note that energy prices were on an upward trend before\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine. For example, the anemic response of the U.S. oil and gas sector to\nhigher prices reflects years of relatively low investment due partly to a shift in investment\ntowards other sources of energy, as well as increased capital discipline following the industry’s\npoor returns during previous boom-bust cycles.\nEnergy Prices and Outlook\nHow will developments in energy markets affect the outlook for growth and inflation?\nRetail gasoline prices reached all-time highs earlier this year, and although prices at the pump\nhave come down, gas prices continue to boost year-over-year inflation. In addition, the price of\ngasoline is perhaps the most salient price in the economy, and fluctuations in gas prices can play\nan outsized role in shaping consumers’ inflation expectations. Currently, longer-term inflation\nexpectations appear to be anchored, but if expectations were to shift, inflation could become\nmore persistent and difficult to control. Highlighting this risk, research by my staff shows that an\nincrease in salient prices, such as gasoline, can have an amplified effect on near-term inflation\nexpectations in an already high-inflation environment.1 Energy prices can also affect inflation as\nan input cost to other industries, like airfares and transportation costs.\nWhat about the implications of higher energy prices for U.S. growth? Higher oil prices\nforce households to spend a larger share of their income on gasoline, lowering their spending on\nother goods and services. Although it is a drag for everyone, it is a larger headwind for lowerincome households that spend a higher share of income on energy. Overall, the negative effect of\nhigher energy prices on consumption can be partly offset by a positive effect on capital\ninvestment in the energy sector. For example, U.S. oil investment boosted total business\ninvestment growth by about 1 percentage point from 2010 to 2014, when growth-oriented oil\ncompanies kept increasing their capacity as oil prices surged. In this cycle, the response of\n\nNida Cakir Melek, Francis M. Dillion, and A. Lee Smith. “Can Higher Gasoline Prices Set Off an Inflationary\nSpiral?” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Economic Review. Forthcoming.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fenergy investment to higher prices has been lackluster, offering less of an offset to the negative\nconsumption effects.\nThe more severe impact of the energy shock on Europe, particularly the disruption of\nnatural gas shipments, will likely also have spillover effects for the U.S. economy. Natural gas is\nan important energy source in Europe, and the effects of a shortage could be particularly notable\nfor Germany’s gas-intensive chemicals, paper, and metals production sectors. Complex global\nsupply chains can propagate and amplify such disruptions, a lesson learned during the pandemic.\nThe Outlook for Inflation and the Economy\nThis energy shock hits during a time of already heightened economic uncertainty.\nAlthough growth has slowed notably this year, the labor market remains tight, and inflation has\nbeen high and persistent. Prices, as measured by the CPI, increased 7.7 percent over the 12\nmonths ending in October, down from, but still uncomfortably close to, the 9 percent 40-year\nhigh recorded in June. While lower energy prices have pulled down overall inflation in recent\nmonths, inflation (excluding energy prices) ran at 6.3 percent in October and has been stuck\nstubbornly at about that level throughout 2022.\nA notable development in recent months has been the rotation of price pressures from\ngoods to services. Goods inflation led the increase in inflation in 2021 and through the beginning\nof this year, as consumers stuck at home upgraded their living spaces and pushed demand for\ndurable goods up against an impaired supply side, snarled by production disruptions and\nlogistical jams. More recently, the combination of easing in supply chain disruptions, slowing\nglobal growth, and higher interest rates have contributed to a deceleration in core goods prices.\nIn contrast, services prices have firmed, with monthly increases that continue to be\namong the largest in decades. In addition, the rise in services prices has been broad-based.\nWhereas goods demand has slowed, and the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index has signaled\ncontraction for the first time since 2020, services activity in the District continues to expand,\ncontributing to a tight labor market\nOne compounding factor in the tightness of labor markets and the rise in prices has been\nthe recent poor performance of labor productivity. Output per hour declined at the fastest pace on\nrecord in the first half of the year. While many factors could be behind this decline, including\nchanges in the composition of employment, at this point it is uncertain how persistent this\n3\n\n\fdisappointing productivity growth will be. We asked our District survey contacts about what\nfactors might be behind the declines in labor productivity. The results point to labor mismatch as\nan important factor, with about a third of our contacts reporting a less-qualified workforce\ncompared to pre-pandemic. In addition, the majority of firms reported increased spending and\nresources devoted to employee training.\nThere have been some early indicators that the labor market might be cooling, with\nreported vacancies trending down even as month-to-month changes remain volatile. The rate at\nwhich workers are quitting jobs is also declining, suggesting that workers are becoming a bit less\nconfident that if they leave a job, they’ll easily find a new one. Wage pressures will eventually\nrespond to a cooling labor market, but with a lag. Analysis from my staff suggests that wage\ngrowth crests and starts to fall about a year after the Kansas City Labor Market Conditions\nIndicators (LMCI) activity indicator peaks. Even with the indicator turning down in October, we\nmay still have some time before we see a sustained cooling of wage growth.\nProlonged high inflation could eventually lead to a shift in inflation expectations, a\ndevelopment that would make inflation more persistent and even harder to address, a lesson\nlearned at some cost during the Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s. However, most indicators\nsuggest that even as near-term inflation expectations have risen sharply, expectations are for\ninflation to return to near the Fed’s 2 percent objective in the medium term. Notably, while every\nparticipant in the most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters marked up their expectations\nfor 2022 inflation (and some substantially so), their forecasts of longer-term inflation\nexpectations have scarcely budged.\nWith inflation still elevated and likely to be persistent, monetary policy clearly has more\nwork to do. Earlier hopes that improving supply chains and easing production disruptions would\nsignificantly reduce inflation are fading. As price pressures have rotated from goods to services,\nthe impetus for inflation has moved from tight product markets to tight labor markets. The lower\nresponsiveness of services consumption (and prices) to interest rate increases highlights the\nchallenging dynamics the Federal Reserve faces as it acts to restore price stability.\nOutlook for Monetary Policy\nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve has aggressively tightened monetary policy. The\npolicy rate has increased 375 basis points, the fastest pace since the Fed began to explicitly target\n4\n\n\finterest rates. After more than doubling the size of its balance sheet during the pandemic, the Fed\nis now allowing up to $95 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature every\nmonth, shrinking its asset holdings and putting further upward pressure on interest rates. More\nbroadly, tighter monetary policy has fed through to tighter financial conditions. And tighter\nfinancial conditions are showing through to the real economy as demand eases, especially in\ninterest rate sensitive sectors, such as housing and durable goods.\nStill, imbalances in the economy and the labor market persist, and inflation pressures\nhave yet to let up, suggesting monetary policy and financial conditions must continue to tighten.\nWith the direction of policy clear, the key questions are how far and how quickly will interest\nrates have to rise?\nWhile it is tempting to speculate on how high rates might need to go, the degree of\ntightening necessary will only be determined by observing the dynamics of the economy and\ninflation and cannot be predetermined by theory or pre-pandemic benchmarks. For example, the\nsensitivity of the economy to interest rates can shift for any number of reasons, and judging\nsufficiently restrictive policy could well mean seeing the economy and inflation begin to respond\nin convincing ways. Some have argued that a minimum standard for a restrictive policy is a\npositive inflation-adjusted, or real, rate of interest. Currently, survey evidence indicates that\nconsumers expect inflation to run at about 5 percent over the next year, above the current 3¾ to 4\npercent target range for the policy interest rate, suggesting that the real interest rate remains\nnegative. This measure would point to considerably higher rates than current levels.\nOne factor complicating the determination of how high rates will have to go is the large\nstock of liquid savings on household balance sheets. During the pandemic, fiscal policy\ntransferred a tremendous amount of balance sheet capacity from the government to households\nand business. The government’s borrowing was the private sector’s saving. How households\ntreat this accumulation of saving will be important for shaping the outlook for output, inflation,\nand interest rates. It could very well require a higher interest rate for some time to convince\nhouseholds to hold onto this saving rather than to spend it down and add to the inflationary\nimpulse.\nWith inflation and a tight economy suggesting further increases in interest rates are\nnecessary, at what pace should rates be increased? With a firm commitment to return inflation to\ntarget, the pace of hikes is less important than the strength and communication of this\n5\n\n\fcommitment. I continue to see several advantages for a steady and deliberate approach to raising\nthe policy rate.\nA more measured approached to rate increases may be particularly useful as\npolicymakers judge the economy’s response to higher rates. Already, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee’s policy actions have led to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. The yield on\nthe 10-year Treasury bond has increased 260 basis points since January, the fastest increase in\nalmost 40 years. Mortgage rates have more than doubled. The dollar has appreciated 10 percent\nagainst a wide range of currencies, and stock market indices have declined by about 20 precent.\nThese are big moves in financial markets, seen previously in only the most extraordinary times.\nThe speed at which rates have increased has likely contributed to the marked increase in\npolicy rate uncertainty, if only by widening the range of possible action. Uncertainty around the\npolicy rate is currently very high, in part reflecting an unsettled outlook, but also importantly,\nuncertainty over the central bank’s reaction function. I expect some of the increase in uncertainty\ncan be attributed to an aggressive front-loading strategy of policy tightening. As the tightening\ncycle continues, now is a particularly important time to avoid unduly contributing to financial\nmarket volatility, especially as volatility stresses market liquidity with the potential to complicate\nbalance sheet run-off plans.\nRestoring price stability is essential to the nation’s long-run economic growth prospects.\nWithout question, monetary policy must respond decisively to high inflation to avoid embedding\nexpectations of future inflation. In my view, a steadfast commitment to returning inflation to the\nCommittee’s target is important. So is the pace of rate increases. Navigating the path ahead in\nthis time of uncertainty and volatility will require attention to both.\n\n6\n\n\f"

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nNovember 10, 2022 \nDelivered at “Energy and the Economy: The New Energy Landscape,” a conference hosted by the \nFederal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \nHouston, Texas  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors,  officers, or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you for attending  the seventh  annual Energy Conference, hosted by the Kansas \nCity and Dallas Federal Reserve Banks.   \nEnergy  is often in the spotlight given its central role in the economy, but the events of \nthis past year have only further reinforced the importance of energy to our region, the economy, \nand the backdrop  for conducting monetary policy. Today I will offer an outl ook for the U.S. \neconomy and my views on monetary policy. I’ll set the stage for those perspectives by looking \nfirst at the impact of developments in energy markets .   \n Energy Prices on the Rise \nEnergy prices have been on a wild ride this  year. Brent crude oil ran up above $120 a \nbarrel mid -year before falling back to $95  a barrel . Even at the lower level, it is more than 10 \npercent higher than the price a year ago  and far above  the roughly $60 a barrel average price that \nheld over the five years prior to the  pandemic. The moves in natural gas prices have been even \nmore dramatic , with domestic natural gas prices doubling through the middle of this year, before \nretreating to a lev el below where they were last October (and even briefly falling below zero at \none trading hub in recent weeks) . However, like oil, natural gas prices remain far above pre-\npandemic averages.    \nSimilar to  higher prices in the broader economy, the increase in energy prices primarily \nreflects a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand. Resurgent demand following the fading of pandemic lockdowns has run into a constrained supply side . Somewhat surprisingly, \nthe oil and gas extraction and petroleum product s industries have shown the least recovery of any \nsector in the U.S. economy, both producing at about 60 percent of pre -pandemic levels . This is  \neven worse than the  supply -chain addled motor vehicle dealer sector, where output is running at \nabout 70 percent of pre -pandemic levels. The imbalance between supply and demand in the oil \nand gas sectors has unsurprisingly pushed up prices.   \nOf course, the increase in prices is not sole ly due to lagging production in the United \nStates. Russia’s invasion of Uk raine has upended the entire global system of energy trade , not \njust for oil, but for almost every form of energy. Russia accounts for more than 10 percent  of \nglobal oil exports, close to 20 percent  of global natural gas exports, and about 15 percent  of \nglobal coal exports —with  Europe being its primary  market. This heavy reliance pushed \nEuropean natural gas prices to historic highs , and the economic consequences of the energy \n\n2 \n supply shock are likely be sizeable for European economies.  In addition  to the  disruption of \ntrade, sanctions are likely to dent global production. T he International Energy Agency estimates \na potential loss of 2  percent  of world oil supply as sanctions hit Russian production .  \nHowever, it is important to note that e nergy prices were on an upward trend before \nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine . For example, the anemic response of the U.S. oil and gas sector to \nhigher prices reflects years of relatively low investment due partly to a shift in investment \ntowards other sources of energy, as wel l as increased capital discipline following the industry’s \npoor returns  during previous boom -bust cycles .  \n \nEnergy Prices and Outlook  \nHow will developments in energy markets affect the outlook  for growth and inflation?  \nRetail gasoline prices reached all -time highs earlier this year, and although prices at the pump \nhave come down, gas prices continue to boost  year-over -year inflation . In addition, the  price of \ngasoline is  perhaps the most salient price in the economy,  and fluctuations in gas prices can play \nan outsized role in sha ping consumers’ inflation expectations. Currently , longer -term inflation \nexpectations appear to be anchored, but if expectations were to shift, inflation could become \nmore persistent and difficult to control. Highlighting this risk , research by my staff shows that an \nincrease in salient prices, such as gasoline, can have an amplified effect on near -term inflation \nexpectations in an already high -inflation environment .1 Energy prices can also affect inflation as \nan input cost to other industries, like airfares and transportation costs.   \nWhat about the implications of higher energy prices for U.S. growth? H igher oil prices \nforce households to spend a larger share of thei r income on gasoline, lowering their spending on \nother goods and services. Although it is a drag for everyone, it is a larger headwind for lower -\nincome households that spend a higher share of income on energy. Overall, the  negative effect of \nhigher energy prices on consumption can be partly  offset by a positive effect on capital \ninvestment  in the energy sector . For example, U.S. oil investment boosted total business \ninvestment growth by about 1 percentage point  from 2010 to 2014, when growth-oriented oil \ncompanies kept increasing their capacity as oil prices surged. In this cycle , the response of \n \n1 Nida  Ca kir Melek, Fra ncis M. Dillion, a nd A. Lee Smith . “Can Higher Ga soline Prices Set Off a n Inflationary \nSpira l? ” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  Economic Review . Forthcoming.  \n\n3 \n energy investment to higher prices has been lackluster, offering less of an offset to the negative \nconsumption effect s. \nThe more severe impact of the energy shock o n Europe, particularly the disruption of \nnatural gas shipments, will likely also have spillover effects for the U.S. economy. Natural gas is \nan important energy source in Europe, and the effects of a shortage could be particularly notable  \nfor Germany’s gas -intensive chemicals, paper, and metals production sectors. Complex global \nsupply chains can propagate and amplify such disruptions , a lesson learned during the pandemic.   \n \nThe Outlook for Inflation and the Economy   \nThis energy shock hit s during a time of already heightened economic uncertainty.  \nAlthough growth has slowed notably this year, the labor market remains tight, and inflation has \nbeen high and persistent. Prices , as measured by the CPI,  increased 7.7 percent over the 12  \nmonths ending in October , down from, but still uncomfortably close  to, the 9 percent  40-year \nhigh recorded in June. While lower energy prices have pulled down overall inflation  in recent \nmonths, inflation (excluding energy  prices ) ran at 6.3 percent in October  and has been stuck \nstubbornly at about that level throughout 2022.    \nA notable development in recent months has been the rotation of price pressures from \ngoods to services. Goods inflation led the increase in inflation in 2021 and through the beginning of this year , as consumers stuck at home upgraded their living spaces and pushed demand for \ndurable goods up against an impaired supply side, snarled by production disruptions and logistical jams. More recently, t he combination of easing in supply chain disruptions, slowing \nglobal growth, and higher interest rates have contributed to a deceleration in core goods prices.     \nIn contrast, services prices have firmed, with monthly increases that continue to be \namong the largest in decades. In addition, t he rise in  services prices has been broad -based.  \nWhereas goods demand has slowed, and the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index has signaled \ncontraction  for the first time since 2020, services activity in the District continues to expand , \ncontributing to a tight labor market \nOne compounding factor in the tightness of labor markets and the rise in prices  has been \nthe recent poor performance of labor productivity. Output per hour decline d at the fastest pace on \nrecord in the first half of the year. While many factors could be be hind this decline, including \nchanges in the composition of employment, at this point it is uncertain how persistent this \n\n4 \n disappointing productivity growth will be . We asked our District survey contacts about what \nfactors might be behind the declines in labor productivity. Th e results point to labor mismatch as \nan important factor, with about  a third of our contacts reporting a less -qualified workforce \ncompared to pre -pandemic. In addition, the majority of firms reported increased spending and \nresources devo ted to employee training.  \nThere have been some early indicators that the labor market might be cooling, with \nreported vacancies trending down even as month -to-month changes remain volatile. The rate at \nwhich workers are quitting jobs is also declining, suggesting that workers are becoming a bit less \nconfident that if they leave a job, they’ll easily find a new one.  Wage pressures will eventually \nrespond to a cooling labor market , but with a lag. Analysis from my staff suggests that wage \ngrowth crests and starts to fall about a year after the Kansas City Labor Market Conditions \nIndicators ( LMCI ) activity indic ator peaks. Even with the indic ator turning down in October , we \nmay still have some time before we see a sustained cooling of wage growth.  \nProlonged high inflation could eventually lead to a shift in inflation expectations, a \ndevelopment that would make inflation more persistent and even harder to address , a lesson \nlearned at some cost during the Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s . However, most indicators \nsuggest that even as near -term inflation expectations have risen sharply, expectations are for \ninflation to return to near the Fed’s 2 percent objective  in the medium te rm. Notably, while every \nparticipant in the most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters marked up their expectations \nfor 2022 inflation (and some substantially so), their forecasts of longer -term inflation \nexpectations have scarcely budged.  \nWith inflation still elevated and likely to be persistent, monetary policy clearly has more \nwork to do. Earlier hopes that improving supply chains and easing production disruptions would \nsignificantly reduce inflation are fading . As price pressures have rotated  from goods to services, \nthe impetus for inflation has moved from tight product markets to tight labor markets. The lower \nresponsiveness of services consumption (and prices) to interest rate increases highlights the \nchallenging dynamics the Federal Reserve faces  as it acts  to restor e price stability.  \n \nOutlook for Monetary Policy \nOver the past year, the Federal Reserve has aggressively tighten ed monetary policy . The \npolicy rate has increased 375  basis points, the fastest pace  since the Fed began to explicitly  target  \n\n5 \n interest rates.  After more than doubling the size of its balance sheet during the pandemic, t he Fed \nis now allowing up to $95 billion in Treasuries and m ortgage -backed securities to mature  every \nmonth, shrinking its asset holdings and putting further upward pressure on interest rates . More \nbroadly, t ighter monetary policy has fed through to tighter financial conditions. And t ighter \nfinancial conditions are showing through to the real econom y as demand eas es, especially in \ninterest rate sensitive sectors, such as housing and  durable goods .   \nStill, imbalances in the economy  and the labor market  persist , and inflation pressures \nhave yet to let up , suggesting monetary policy and financial conditions must continue to tighten.   \nWith the direction of policy clear , the key questions are how far and how quickly will interest \nrates  have to rise ? \nWhile it is tempting to speculate on how high rates might need to go, the degree of \ntightening necessa ry will only be determined by observing the dynamics of the economy and \ninflation and can not be predetermined by theory or pre -pandemic benchmarks.

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \nSeptember 9, 2022 \nPeterson Institute for International Economics  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.   \n\n1 \n  \nTwo weeks ago, the Kansas City Fed hosted its annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy \nSymposium . The theme of this year’s program focused on, “Reassessing Constraints on the \nEconomy and Policy.”     \nAn elaboration of constraints has been a valuable contribution of the field of economics.  \nOpportunity costs, comparative advantage, and the Phillips Curve are  all defined around the \nexistence of constraints and limits.   \nHowever, over the past quarter -century  the economic conversation has been dominated \nby concerns  over insufficient demand , and supply constraints faded  into the background.  \nSupporting this shift, recent  recessions —up until the pandemic —have largely been attributed to \nfinancial disruptions related to demand being support ed by unsustainable asset allocations . This \nis different from  the supply shocks and inflationary dynamics that had driven ea rlier post-war \nrecessions.    \nThe economic recovery following the pandemic shock has brought supply considerations \nback to center stage.  Bottlenecks and shortages related to pandemic disruptions have limited \nsupply and driven  up prices.  More generally, strong demand , supported by a historic level of \nfiscal and monetary accommodation , has pushed on  the capacity limits of the economy.  With \ndemand no longer insufficient , supply constraints have become a key factor in the outlook for \neconomic acti vity.  \nThe policy response to the pandemic raises additional questions about constraints.  The \nextraordinary fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic appeared to redraw the boundaries \nof policy . Innovative  and expansive fiscal programs pushed debt -to-GDP ratios to new highs  as \ncentral bank balance sheets expanded rapidly with little discussion of constraints.  \nAgainst this backdrop, I’ll spend a few minutes on the current outlook for the economy \nand for policy.  On the economy, I will argue that the constraints revealed by the pandemic are \nlikely to be with us for some time, perpetuating imbalances , contributing to inflation, and \nrequiring a sustained policy response.  I will also argue that constraints continue to bind policy , \nwith a focus on the bala nce sheet and efforts to significantly reduce it from its current elevated \nlevel.  \n \n \n\n2 \n The Economic Outlook  \nHigh inflation is certainly a sign that constraints are binding  the economy . Prices, \nmeasured on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increased 6.3  percent in the 12 months \nending in July, down from  June’s 40 -year high, but still far above the FOMC’s 2 percent \nobjective.  Energy prices have played an outsized role in inflation over the past year . Oil prices \nrose with the war in Ukraine but fell back over the summer  as recession fears grew . Food prices \nhave also contributed to the rise in inflation . In part, this is related to  the run up in agricultural \ncommodity prices  connected to  the war in Ukraine, but it is also a result of  stressed growing \nconditions in many regions around the world, including in the western portion of the Kansas City \nFed’s region.   \nHowever,  it is not just food and energy prices  driving inflation . Excluding  food and \nenergy , core PCE prices hav e risen 4.6 percent over the past 12  months, also near a 40-year high.  \nThe rise in inflation  has been very broad-based, with almost every category of consumption \nrecording an increase in prices  and about one -third  of categories showing increases far above \ntrend .  \nThe widespread  nature of inflation suggests that a tight economy is driving price \npressures rather than solely individual supply disruptions and shocks. Two main factors appear to \nbe contributing to this tightness. First, as the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand \nsurged , underpinned by a tremendous amount of fiscal and monetary poli cy support. The federal \ngovernment has provided roughly $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus since the start of the pandemic. \nMonetary policy was also very accommodative, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero \nand added over $4 trillion to its balance  sheet . While consumption growth has moderated this \nyear, the level of demand remains strong, particularly for goods.  For example, the consumption \nof durable goods continues to run about 20 percent above its pre -pandemic trend.   \nA second factor boosting inflation has been the inability of the supply side of the \neconomy to keep up with the strength of demand.  At first,  the lack of supply seemed to largely \nreflect temporary disruptions related to the closing and reopening the econom y. However, now it \nseems increasingly apparent that there has been  persistent damage to the supply side of the \neconomy as a result of the pandemic.    \n\n3 \n Constraints on the Economy  \nThree factors coming out of the pandemic seem likely to present a continued drag on \neconomic supply:  continuing  damage to global supply chains, the quick destruction of capacity \nin the service sector, and long -lasting damage to workforce engagement and labor force \nparticipation.  I will quickly review these issues.  \nThe sh ock of the pandemic shutdowns and the sudden shift to goods consumption \ncontinues to reverberate through the global economy, with shortages and logistical snarls still \nplagu ing many industries . The war in Ukraine, disruptions to E uropean energy supply, and \ndrought conditions across the globe that have disrupted both agriculture and inland transportation \nas rivers run dry  have only contributed further to these supply disruptions.  There has been so me \ndiscussion that recent shocks could elicit  permanent changes in product ion processes.  As the \nefficiency of just -in-time production and global networks gives way to the accumulation of \nunproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency over efficiency, the damage  to global \nproductivity could prove permanent.   \nA second supply factor contributing to the tightness of the economy, particularly in the \nservice sector, has been the quick destruction of capacity in a number of industries.  Services \ninflation has picked up to 4.6  percent, the fastest pace in decades, even as services consumption \nremains 4 percent below its pre -pandemic trend.  Elevated inflation suggests the sector is at \ncapacity, although relative to pre -pandemic levels there would still appear to  be considerable \nslack . One concrete example of a  relatively persistent reduction in capacity appears to be playing \nout in the airline industry . Airfares have climbed 15 percent above pre -pandemic levels as strong \ndemand has run up on  a system that has yet to fully recover.   \nLabor markets are a third  factor shaping the outlook for the supply side of the economy.  \nWhile employment growth has been robust, and the unemployment  rate has fallen to near record \nlows, workforce engagement conti nues to lag.  The labor force participation rate remains one \npercentage point below pre -pandemic levels, representing roughly 2 million missing workers.  \nThe decline in participation is now concentrated among those older than 55 and likely reflects \nearly retirements  and health concerns , decisions which can  be sticky and difficult to reverse . In \ncontrast, the pandemic -induced decline in participation among prime age women , likely \nreflecting disruptions to dependent care, has now c ompletely reversed , with participation by \nprime age wom en near an all -time  high in July.  \n\n4 \n An additional  factor holding back the ability of supply to ease inflation pressures has \nbeen the abysmal recent performance of productivity.  Labor productivity , as measured by output \nper hour , declined almost 6 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year. It was  the largest \ntwo-quarter decline on record.1 The sharp falloff in measured productivity is not surprising when \nwe consider that the economy added 3 million new workers in the first half of the year even as \nthe level of output (as defined by GDP) declined 1 percent at an annual rate.  Looking back over \nhistory, GDP has almost never declined for two quarters even as the recorded numbe r of hours \nworked has increased.2  \n \nMonetary Policy Considerations  \nTo repeat a phrase that has become common through the pandemic, we are in \nunprecedented times.  The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy cannot, of course, reverse the \nsupply shocks or loosen the constraints that have boosted inflation. It can, however, moderate the pace of demand growth to narrow imbalances in the economy and reduce price pressures. By raising interest rates , the Federal Reserve can help manage demand growth, in part by \nincentivizing saving over consumption and also through the effect on asset prices and financial market conditions.  \nBy taking deliberate policy actions, the Federal Reser ve can also prevent high inflation \nfrom becoming embedded in price - and wage-setting behavior. For many workers, recent wage \nincreases have not kept pace with price inflation. Declining real, or inflation -adjusted, wages are \nnot sustainable and could lead workers and businesses to build high inflation into wage contracts, to the long -term detriment of the labor market. Instead, experience has shown that low and stable \ninflation is most conducive to promoting sustainable growth and to maintaining a strong la bor \nmarket that benefits households, workers, and businesses.  \nSince March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  has increased the policy rate \nby 225 basis points, and, beginning this month,  has accelerated the process of shrinking the Fed’s \nbalance sheet. In response to these actions, and with expectations of further rate hikes, broader financial conditions have tightened , including mortgage and other borrowing rates.  However, \n \n1 In a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium (Fernald a nd Li , 2022 ), the authors a rgue that the \nrecent decline in productivity reflects a return to the lackluster pre -pandemic trend.    \n2 Of course, it is possible that the data has been mismeasured, and a  number of  commentators have noted that \nalternative measures of economic output , such as Gross Domestic Income,  paint a more upbeat picture than GD P. \n\n5 \n with the policy rate still relatively low , the balance sheet still  near $9 trillion , and imbalances in \nthe economy still holding up inflation , the case for continuing to remove policy accommodation \nremains  clear -cut. The key questions are by how much and how quickly.  \nOn the question of how much further tighten ing is req uired, I believe only careful \nobservation of the economy will provide the answer.  As unsatisfying as it might be, weighing in \non the peak policy rate is likely just speculation at this point.  The often -discussed  neutral rate of \ninterest, or the tipping poi nt between accommodative and restrictive policy , is an  unobserved and \npotentially unstable benchmark , potentially undermining its value as either a guide for policy or \npublic communication.  Whether any level of the interest rate is accommodative or restrictive will \ndepend on the interest  sensitivity of the economy, which could vary for any number of reasons.  \nFor example, as spending shifted away from services toward relatively interest-sensitive  housing \nand durable goods during the pandemic, the economy may have become more susceptible to \nhigher interest rates. However, the significant accumulation of liquid savings during the \npandemic could work in the opposite direction, dampen ing the effects of higher interest rates on \nspending and ultimately inflation.  \nWe will have to determine the course of our policy through observation rather than \nreference to theoretical model s or pre -pandemic trends . Given the  likely  lags in the pas sthrough \nof tighter monetary policy  to real econom ic conditions , this argues for steadiness  and \npurposefulness  over speed.    \nThe path of policy is also likely to influence plan s to shrink the Federal Reserve’s \nelevated balance sheet.  The economy is in unfamiliar territory, with a combinatio n of high \ninflation and tight labor markets not seen  in decades. M arkets are understandably volatile as they \ngrapple with the many unknowns surrounding the outlook for the economy. Limiting the extent \nto which uncertainty about the pace of interest rate ad justments contributes to this volatility \ncould be important as balance sheet runoff hits its stride . Certainly, relative to the last time \nbalance sheet reduction was initiated in 2017, market conditions are considerably more unsettled. To the extent that the strains in the Treasury market can be attributed in part to heightened \nuncertainty about the path of policy rates, a steady path of rate increases and predictably \nadjusting this path to incoming data could improve market functioning and facilitate balance \nsheet runoff.  \n\n6 \n Successfully shrinking the balance sheet will lessen the Federal Reserve’s footprint in \nfinancial markets.

        "content": "Constraints on the Economy and Policy\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nSeptember 9, 2022\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fTwo weeks ago, the Kansas City Fed hosted its annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy\nSymposium. The theme of this year’s program focused on, “Reassessing Constraints on the\nEconomy and Policy.”\nAn elaboration of constraints has been a valuable contribution of the field of economics.\nOpportunity costs, comparative advantage, and the Phillips Curve are all defined around the\nexistence of constraints and limits.\nHowever, over the past quarter-century the economic conversation has been dominated\nby concerns over insufficient demand, and supply constraints faded into the background.\nSupporting this shift, recent recessions—up until the pandemic—have largely been attributed to\nfinancial disruptions related to demand being supported by unsustainable asset allocations. This\nis different from the supply shocks and inflationary dynamics that had driven earlier post-war\nrecessions.\nThe economic recovery following the pandemic shock has brought supply considerations\nback to center stage. Bottlenecks and shortages related to pandemic disruptions have limited\nsupply and driven up prices. More generally, strong demand, supported by a historic level of\nfiscal and monetary accommodation, has pushed on the capacity limits of the economy. With\ndemand no longer insufficient, supply constraints have become a key factor in the outlook for\neconomic activity.\nThe policy response to the pandemic raises additional questions about constraints. The\nextraordinary fiscal and monetary response to the pandemic appeared to redraw the boundaries\nof policy. Innovative and expansive fiscal programs pushed debt-to-GDP ratios to new highs as\ncentral bank balance sheets expanded rapidly with little discussion of constraints.\nAgainst this backdrop, I’ll spend a few minutes on the current outlook for the economy\nand for policy. On the economy, I will argue that the constraints revealed by the pandemic are\nlikely to be with us for some time, perpetuating imbalances, contributing to inflation, and\nrequiring a sustained policy response. I will also argue that constraints continue to bind policy,\nwith a focus on the balance sheet and efforts to significantly reduce it from its current elevated\nlevel.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Economic Outlook\nHigh inflation is certainly a sign that constraints are binding the economy. Prices,\nmeasured on personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increased 6.3 percent in the 12 months\nending in July, down from June’s 40-year high, but still far above the FOMC’s 2 percent\nobjective. Energy prices have played an outsized role in inflation over the past year. Oil prices\nrose with the war in Ukraine but fell back over the summer as recession fears grew. Food prices\nhave also contributed to the rise in inflation. In part, this is related to the run up in agricultural\ncommodity prices connected to the war in Ukraine, but it is also a result of stressed growing\nconditions in many regions around the world, including in the western portion of the Kansas City\nFed’s region.\nHowever, it is not just food and energy prices driving inflation. Excluding food and\nenergy, core PCE prices have risen 4.6 percent over the past 12 months, also near a 40-year high.\nThe rise in inflation has been very broad-based, with almost every category of consumption\nrecording an increase in prices and about one-third of categories showing increases far above\ntrend.\nThe widespread nature of inflation suggests that a tight economy is driving price\npressures rather than solely individual supply disruptions and shocks. Two main factors appear to\nbe contributing to this tightness. First, as the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand\nsurged, underpinned by a tremendous amount of fiscal and monetary policy support. The federal\ngovernment has provided roughly $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus since the start of the pandemic.\nMonetary policy was also very accommodative, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero\nand added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet. While consumption growth has moderated this\nyear, the level of demand remains strong, particularly for goods. For example, the consumption\nof durable goods continues to run about 20 percent above its pre-pandemic trend.\nA second factor boosting inflation has been the inability of the supply side of the\neconomy to keep up with the strength of demand. At first, the lack of supply seemed to largely\nreflect temporary disruptions related to the closing and reopening the economy. However, now it\nseems increasingly apparent that there has been persistent damage to the supply side of the\neconomy as a result of the pandemic.\n\n2\n\n\fConstraints on the Economy\nThree factors coming out of the pandemic seem likely to present a continued drag on\neconomic supply: continuing damage to global supply chains, the quick destruction of capacity\nin the service sector, and long-lasting damage to workforce engagement and labor force\nparticipation. I will quickly review these issues.\nThe shock of the pandemic shutdowns and the sudden shift to goods consumption\ncontinues to reverberate through the global economy, with shortages and logistical snarls still\nplaguing many industries. The war in Ukraine, disruptions to European energy supply, and\ndrought conditions across the globe that have disrupted both agriculture and inland transportation\nas rivers run dry have only contributed further to these supply disruptions. There has been some\ndiscussion that recent shocks could elicit permanent changes in production processes. As the\nefficiency of just-in-time production and global networks gives way to the accumulation of\nunproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency over efficiency, the damage to global\nproductivity could prove permanent.\nA second supply factor contributing to the tightness of the economy, particularly in the\nservice sector, has been the quick destruction of capacity in a number of industries. Services\ninflation has picked up to 4.6 percent, the fastest pace in decades, even as services consumption\nremains 4 percent below its pre-pandemic trend. Elevated inflation suggests the sector is at\ncapacity, although relative to pre-pandemic levels there would still appear to be considerable\nslack. One concrete example of a relatively persistent reduction in capacity appears to be playing\nout in the airline industry. Airfares have climbed 15 percent above pre-pandemic levels as strong\ndemand has run up on a system that has yet to fully recover.\nLabor markets are a third factor shaping the outlook for the supply side of the economy.\nWhile employment growth has been robust, and the unemployment rate has fallen to near record\nlows, workforce engagement continues to lag. The labor force participation rate remains one\npercentage point below pre-pandemic levels, representing roughly 2 million missing workers.\nThe decline in participation is now concentrated among those older than 55 and likely reflects\nearly retirements and health concerns, decisions which can be sticky and difficult to reverse. In\ncontrast, the pandemic-induced decline in participation among prime age women, likely\nreflecting disruptions to dependent care, has now completely reversed, with participation by\nprime age women near an all-time high in July.\n3\n\n\fAn additional factor holding back the ability of supply to ease inflation pressures has\nbeen the abysmal recent performance of productivity. Labor productivity, as measured by output\nper hour, declined almost 6 percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year. It was the largest\ntwo-quarter decline on record.1 The sharp falloff in measured productivity is not surprising when\nwe consider that the economy added 3 million new workers in the first half of the year even as\nthe level of output (as defined by GDP) declined 1 percent at an annual rate. Looking back over\nhistory, GDP has almost never declined for two quarters even as the recorded number of hours\nworked has increased. 2\nMonetary Policy Considerations\nTo repeat a phrase that has become common through the pandemic, we are in\nunprecedented times. The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy cannot, of course, reverse the\nsupply shocks or loosen the constraints that have boosted inflation. It can, however, moderate the\npace of demand growth to narrow imbalances in the economy and reduce price pressures. By\nraising interest rates, the Federal Reserve can help manage demand growth, in part by\nincentivizing saving over consumption and also through the effect on asset prices and financial\nmarket conditions.\nBy taking deliberate policy actions, the Federal Reserve can also prevent high inflation\nfrom becoming embedded in price- and wage-setting behavior. For many workers, recent wage\nincreases have not kept pace with price inflation. Declining real, or inflation-adjusted, wages are\nnot sustainable and could lead workers and businesses to build high inflation into wage contracts,\nto the long-term detriment of the labor market. Instead, experience has shown that low and stable\ninflation is most conducive to promoting sustainable growth and to maintaining a strong labor\nmarket that benefits households, workers, and businesses.\nSince March, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the policy rate\nby 225 basis points, and, beginning this month, has accelerated the process of shrinking the Fed’s\nbalance sheet. In response to these actions, and with expectations of further rate hikes, broader\nfinancial conditions have tightened, including mortgage and other borrowing rates. However,\nIn a paper presented at this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium (Fernald and Li, 2022), the authors argue that the\nrecent decline in productivity reflects a return to the lackluster pre-pandemic trend.\n2\nOf course, it is possible that the data has been mismeasured, and a number of commentators have noted that\nalternative measures of economic output, such as Gross Domestic Income, paint a more upbeat picture than GDP.\n1\n\n4\n\n\fwith the policy rate still relatively low, the balance sheet still near $9 trillion, and imbalances in\nthe economy still holding up inflation, the case for continuing to remove policy accommodation\nremains clear-cut. The key questions are by how much and how quickly.\nOn the question of how much further tightening is required, I believe only careful\nobservation of the economy will provide the answer. As unsatisfying as it might be, weighing in\non the peak policy rate is likely just speculation at this point. The often-discussed neutral rate of\ninterest, or the tipping point between accommodative and restrictive policy, is an unobserved and\npotentially unstable benchmark, potentially undermining its value as either a guide for policy or\npublic communication. Whether any level of the interest rate is accommodative or restrictive will\ndepend on the interest sensitivity of the economy, which could vary for any number of reasons.\nFor example, as spending shifted away from services toward relatively interest-sensitive housing\nand durable goods during the pandemic, the economy may have become more susceptible to\nhigher interest rates. However, the significant accumulation of liquid savings during the\npandemic could work in the opposite direction, dampening the effects of higher interest rates on\nspending and ultimately inflation.\nWe will have to determine the course of our policy through observation rather than\nreference to theoretical models or pre-pandemic trends. Given the likely lags in the passthrough\nof tighter monetary policy to real economic conditions, this argues for steadiness and\npurposefulness over speed.\nThe path of policy is also likely to influence plans to shrink the Federal Reserve’s\nelevated balance sheet. The economy is in unfamiliar territory, with a combination of high\ninflation and tight labor markets not seen in decades. Markets are understandably volatile as they\ngrapple with the many unknowns surrounding the outlook for the economy. Limiting the extent\nto which uncertainty about the pace of interest rate adjustments contributes to this volatility\ncould be important as balance sheet runoff hits its stride. Certainly, relative to the last time\nbalance sheet reduction was initiated in 2017, market conditions are considerably more unsettled.\nTo the extent that the strains in the Treasury market can be attributed in part to heightened\nuncertainty about the path of policy rates, a steady path of rate increases and predictably\nadjusting this path to incoming data could improve market functioning and facilitate balance\nsheet runoff.\n\n5\n\n\fSuccessfully shrinking the balance sheet will lessen the Federal Reserve’s footprint in\nfinancial markets. In particular, the large balance sheet is distorting the price of duration and\nartificially flattening the yield curve in a way that could promote a reach for yield by investors\nwith potential implications for financial stability.\nDespite plans announced last May to significantly reduce the size of the balance sheet,\nthe potential exists that there is an asymmetry that allows for relatively easy increases in the\nbalance sheet but makes subsequent decreases more difficult. In a paper presented at this year’s\nJackson Hole Symposium, the authors argue that financial markets can become dependent on the\nincreased liquidity added to the system as the balance sheet expands. 3 After markets have\nadapted and allocated the massive increase in liquidity from asset purchases, subsequently\nreducing the balance sheet can be difficult. As a result, large reductions in liquidity, especially\nabsent a signal on longer-run objectives for the balance sheet, can result in volatility, like we\nwitnessed in September 2019. One implication is that a clear signal to financial markets that an\nexpanded balance sheet is temporary and not meant to be permanent could dampen volatility and\nease the drawdown in liquidity in the longer run.\nThis is an important argument as the Federal Reserve considers the ultimate size of its\nbalance sheet. Having committed to operating in an ample reserves regime, what constitutes\n“ample” can evolve over time and will be dependent on the decisions of financial market\nparticipants. A persistently large balance sheet can lead banks to adjust their business models\naround a high level of central bank liquidity, which then raises the amount of reserves required to\nmaintain the ample regime.\nAvoiding this threat will require clear signaling of resolve to shrink the balance sheet and\nremove liquidity. Given a clear signal, markets are less likely to become “liquidity dependent”\nand adjust their behavior in anticipation of declining reserve balances. There may be benefits to\nannouncing the desired reserve levels as the balance sheet shrinks, giving banks time to prepare\nto operate with significantly fewer reserves.\n\nAcharya, Chauhan, Rajan, and Steffen (2022). “Liquidity Dependence: Why Shrinking Central Bank Balance\nSheets is an Uphill Task.”\n3\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "Looking Back: A 40-Year Perspective on Community Banking\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nAugust 4, 2022\nKansas Bankers Association Annual Conference\nColorado Springs, Colo.\n\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you for inviting me to join you for this year’s conference. Doug Wareham and his\nteam are key partners with the Kansas City Fed as we deliver on the Federal Reserve’s core\nmissions for monetary policy, supervision and regulation, and payment services.\nThe role of the banking industry in the U.S. economy has been central to my work at the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for more than 40 years. From my first assignment as an\nexaminer in 1982 to my current position as the Bank’s president and CEO and member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee, I have witnessed dramatic changes to the financial system and\nthe broader economic landscape. And despite this tremendous change, it remains as true today as\nit did in 1982 that access to credit and other reliable financial services is essential to the success\nof local communities, households and small businesses.\nWith that overarching theme, my remarks today will focus on some key developments\nthat I view as shaping the current and future community bank landscape. For example, my own\nFederal Reserve district, which covers the heart of the Midwest, parts of the Rocky Mountains,\nand the Southwest, has over the last few decades, gradually urbanized as people moved from\nsmall towns to larger, more urban centers, a trend that parallels much of the rest of the country.1\nThis population shift occurred as the District’s economy became less concentrated in energy and\nagriculture, and moved towards service sectors and away from manufacturing. 2\nIn the face of these changes, community banks have remained a vital source of banking\nservices for consumers and small businesses, including being a key provider of reliable capital.\n\nRappaport, Jordan, “The Faster Growth of Larger, Less Crowded Locations”, Economic Review, Federal Reserve\nBank of Kansas City, 2018, Fourth Quarter.\n2 See for example, Wilkerson, Chad R. and Megan D. Williams, “The Tenth District’s Defining Industries: How Are\nThey Changing”, Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Third Quarter 2007, 59-81.; Wilkerson,\nChad and Megan Williams, “The Transformation of Manufacturing Across Federal Reserve Districts: Success for the\nGreat Plains?”, Economic Review, Second Quarter, 2012, 111-139.; Felix, Alison, “The Growing Importance of the\nServices Sector”, Rocky Mountain Economist, March 29, 2019.\n1\n\n1\n\n\fWhen I talk to business leaders from the region, I often hear stories of how community banks\nhelp support local entrepreneurs and small business owners. 3 I also hear stories of the challenges\ncommunities face when locally based banks disappear. One business owner in our region noted\nthat after her community’s locally owned banks were acquired, she turned to lines of credit from\none of the nation’s largest banks with favorable terms. In the midst of a product expansion,\nhowever, the national economy turned down and the line of credit was quickly withdrawn. The\nexperience stood in sharp contrast to the reliable access to credit and long-term relationships with\na community bank that her business had enjoyed across previous business cycles.\n\nA Forty-Year Perspective on Community Banking\nBy far, the most significant change to the community banking landscape over the past\nfour decades has been the declining number of banks and increased concentration in the banking\nsector. In 1985, just three years after I began my career with the Kansas City Fed, there were\nabout 15,000 community banks in the United States. Today, that number is less than 5,000. 4\nSimilarly, the number of banks in my seven-state region has declined by more than 70 percent\nover that same period. 5\nMost of the decline in the number of banks has been due to mergers and acquisitions.6\nAlthough community banks still represent the vast majority of bank charters, they now account\nfor only about 13 percent of bank assets nationally as the nation’s largest banks have\n\nSee Skodack, Debra. “Enduring Relevance: In an Evolving Landscape, Community Banks Remain Vital to\nCustomers and the Economy”, Ten Magazine, Fall 2021.\n4 Jacewitz, Stefan, “The Increasing Brick-and-Mortar Efficiency of Community Banks”, Economic Review, Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Second quarter, 2022, 19-35.\n5 Source: Call Reports.\n6 Jagtiani, Julapa. \"Understanding the Effects of the Merger Boom on Community Banks.\" Economic Review-Federal\nReserve Bank of Kansas City 93.2 (2008): 29.\n3\n\n2\n\n\fsignificantly expanded their market share of assets and deposits. 7 With a relatively rural\ngeography, the Kansas City Fed’s region still features hundreds of community banks, holding\nmore than 60 percent of total banking assets and representing 99 percent of banks. 8\nAs the banking system has consolidated, its role in the financial system also has shifted.\nFor example, banks have become a less important source of corporate credit. The share of\nbusiness loans held by banks has declined from nearly 40 percent in 1985 to less than 25 percent\ntoday, as businesses are now more reliant on publicly issued debt and loans from non-banks. The\ndecline in the number of banks may partly explain their reduced role in business lending, but it is\nnot the whole story. Other factors from outside the financial sector have also contributed to these\ndynamics, including the country’s changing demographics, increasing reliance on technology,\nand landmark regulatory changes.9\nDemographic shifts over the last four decades have significantly changed the composition\nof the U.S. population. Since 1980, the number of Americans 65 and older has more than\ndoubled, and the United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse. The Hispanic\npopulation has tripled, and the U.S. population of those of Asian descent has grown five-fold,\nlargely through immigration.\nThese demographic shifts have changed the communities that small banks serve. Nonmetro counties, where large numbers of community banks operate, have seen both slower\npopulation growth and an aging customer base. These counties are also more racially and\n\nHanauer, Matt, Brent Lytle, Chris Summers, and Stephanie Ziadeh, “Community Banks’ Ongoing Role in the U.S.\nEconomy”, Economic Review, Second Quarter, 2021, 37-81.\n8 Source: Call Reports.\n9 Sengupta, Rajdeep, and Jacob Dice. \"Did Local Factors Contribute to the Decline in Bank Branches?\" Economic\nReview-Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 104.3 (2019): 43-3.\n7\n\n3\n\n\fethnically diverse today than they were decades ago, and community banks have had to adapt\nand adopt new strategies for attracting customers and employees.\nIn addition to demographic changes, technological advancements over the last 40 years\nhave been striking. In the financial services sector, these advancements have disaggregated many\ntraditional banking services. Product origination, delivery methods, and customer interactions\nwith financial institutions have all changed dramatically. Banks are also increasingly automating\nprocesses that have historically required human interaction. Although these changes have\nexpedited account management and allowed banks to leverage more advanced modeling to\nmanage risks, they may also have contributed to larger banks’ economies of scale. Perhaps most\nsignificantly, internet and mobile banking has allowed banks to reach customers across the\nglobe, diminishing the necessity of geographic proximity.\nTechnology has also fostered competition from the broader financial services sector with\nnew entrants promising greater speed, convenience, and flexibility in delivering financial\nservices to households and businesses. More recently, lending and payments platforms have\nmoved outside of the banking industry altogether. Household names in the technology sector\nsuch as Amazon, Facebook, Square, and PayPal, along with a wave of fintech startups, continue\nto pursue cutting-edge financial services.\nThese technological innovations reflect customers’ changing preferences for value and\nconvenience. In particular, the demand for fast and mobile payments continues to grow, and\nservices providing these features are being adopted at a very rapid pace.\nAlong with payment innovations, non-bank lenders, especially fintechs, have made\nsignificant inroads into loan markets. Business lending by fintechs has grown very rapidly in\nrecent years. This shift could reflect changes in customers’ expectations or a considered decision\n\n4\n\n\fby banks to avoid certain risky assets. Nonetheless, the trend does suggest a move toward\ntransactional lending forms and away from relationship-based lending. If these trends accelerate,\nlenders that rely heavily on technological solutions using “big-data” to reach borrowers could\nchallenge community banks’ “soft information” advantage and market share.\nFinally, regulation has been an important factor shaping the evolution of banking. Across\nthe spectrum of regulatory changes, three aspects of regulation have factored prominently:\ngeographic deregulation, the deregulation of non-banking activities, and regulation in response to\ncrises.\nGeographic deregulation began slowly in the late 1970s before picking up rapidly in the\n1980s. Ultimately, what started as localized efforts to remove barriers to entry for banks resulted\nin federal legislation that allowed banks to operate and branch nationwide. 10 As a result, bank\nconsolidation picked up considerably starting in the 1980s, mostly reflected in mergers of\nsmaller banks as intra- and interstate restrictions were relaxed. However, geographic\nderegulation also enabled the largest banks to begin operating nationwide and to compete\nglobally. As market share of the largest banks increased in key loan markets, many community\nbanks looked to mergers for scale or saw their balance sheets become more concentrated as some\nbusiness lines moved to larger competitors. 11\nThrough the 1990s, as banking consolidated, the largest banks also began to engage in\nwhat were traditionally considered non-banking activities, predominately securities dealing and\nunderwriting. While these activities had been prohibited at banks for close to 70 years under the\nGlass-Steagall Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permitted a wider array of activities at\n\nRice, Tara and Phillip E. Strahan. “Does Credit Competition Affect Small-Firm Finance?”, The Journal of Finance,\n65(3), 2010, 861-889.\n11 Regehr, Kristen, and Rajdeep Sengupta. \"Sectoral Loan Concentration and Bank Performance (2001-2014).\"\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Working Paper 16-13 (2016).\n10\n\n5\n\n\fbank holding companies. In response, bank holding companies began engaging in investment\nbanking while also maintaining access to important safety net advantages, such as deposit\ninsurance and access to Federal Reserve services.\nThe deregulation of banks’ activities and geographic operation produced two very\ndifferent commercial banking models. Today, thousands of small community banks continue to\noperate in traditional business lines. At the same time, a handful of large banking organizations\nnow operate at such scale and are so intertwined with the financial system that their failure poses\nsystemic risks to the global economy. As revealed during the Global Financial Crisis, large banks\nhave enjoyed some benefits from being “too big to fail.”\nAfter the financial crisis, however, the regulatory environment changed, as it often has\nfollowing financial and economic crises. Regulators sought to learn from the earlier agricultural\nbank and Savings and Loan crises of the 1980s, as well as the Global Financial Crisis of 20072009, and took steps to ensure a safer banking system after each crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act of\n2010, for example, made important inroads into addressing “too big to fail” advantages—though\nhow successful it was remains to be seen.\nThe regulatory responses to these crises have generally taken a one-size-fits-all approach.\nRegulations can be blunt instruments, failing to effectively account for the incentives and risk\nprofiles associated with the relationship lending model of many smaller banks. As a result,\ncommunity banks can bear a disproportionate burden as they implement costly compliance\nprocesses without commensurate benefits to safety and soundness or fair access to credit.\n\n6\n\n\fThe Importance of Community Banks\nEven as new nonbank entrants become embedded in the financial services sector, the\nbanking system continues to hold a unique role in our economy. Banks remain the primary\nfinancial firms for providing liquidity when needed, ensuring payments are readily transferable,\nand facilitating monetary policy implementation.\nFor their part, community banks continue to leverage relationship lending, with a focus\non local lending and deposit-taking. Credit decisions are based on qualitative as well as\nquantitative aspects of a borrower’s credit profile. In particular, smaller banks provide a critical\nsource of financing for small businesses. Despite holding a fraction of the nation’s banking\nassets, community banks underwrite a sizeable 40 percent of lending to small businesses. The\nstrength of the relationship between community banks and small businesses was highlighted\nduring the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program. At a time when COVID-19\nlockdowns threatened the viability of many small businesses, community banks ensured that\npandemic relief funds quickly reached this segment of our economy, ultimately holding 37\npercent of all outstanding PPP loans serviced by banks. 12\nBeyond lending to local businesses and households, smaller banks often serve key\nleadership roles in their communities. These bankers sit on the boards of local schools, hospitals,\nand other civic organizations, not only meeting the credit needs of their local communities, but\nthey are also an integral part of them.\nGiven the importance of these attributes to local economies, the implications of an\nevolving financial services landscape for access to credit in rural markets, for small business, and\nfor the overall health of Main Street should be carefully considered. Both regulators and banks\nMarsh, W. Blake and Padma Sharma, “PPP Raised Community Bank Revenue but Lowered Profitability”,\nEconomic Bulletin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, December 2020.\n12\n\n7\n\n\fwill be influential in ensuring these critical financial services can continue to meet the needs of\nthousands of communities, safely and efficiently.\n\nA Message to Regulators\nHaving been handed thousands and thousands of pages of legislation intended to secure\nthe financial stability of our nation’s financial system, it’s a tall order to ask bank regulators to\nminimize regulatory and supervisory burden while promoting competition and maintaining the\nsafety and soundness of the banking system. It is made more difficult when the business models\nof banks vary from small, traditional banks to global systemically important banks. Still, in the\ninterest of meeting the range of business needs served by these institutions, I see opportunities\nfor further calibrating the supervisory framework, taking into account the business model of\nsmall banks in three key areas: advancing risk-focused approaches to supervision, appropriately\ntailoring capital requirements, and providing clearer guidance around innovation and alternative\nbusiness models.\nOver the past four decades, the volume and complexity of the data collected from\ncommunity banks has increased substantially. This data has supported both policy development\nand supervision. Unfortunately, the time spent on the examination of an individual community\nbank has not meaningfully declined as a result of this data collection. In fact, according to the\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the most recent Community Bank Sentiment Index\nshowed that community banker sentiment toward regulatory burden is at a multi-year low and\nmore negative than any other component. 13 Moreover, a large majority—81 percent of\nrespondents—expect regulatory burden will be worse in the future. 14\n13\n14\n\nConference of State Bank Supervisors, “Community Bank Sentiment Index”, second quarter of 2022.\nIbid.\n\n8\n\n\fUnder the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA),\nregulations can be questioned for their continued effectiveness and burden. This provides an\navenue to reshape the supervisory framework in way that preserves its focus on safety and\nsoundness and fair access to credit while recognizing today’s banking landscape requires a far\nmore tailored approach.\nAmong these regulations, capital requirements play a particularly important role in the\nstability of our financial system. Here, too, ensuring that these requirements are capturing the full\nrange of risks and avoiding unintended advantages will be necessary. The financial crisis of\n2007-2008, as well as the market upheavals of March 2020, demonstrated that extreme events\ncan and do happen. Most importantly, bank failures, particularly large bank failures, are costly.\nCapital requirements should reflect these heavy social costs.\nCurrently, the nation’s largest banks hold less capital than community banks. While small\nbanks in the United States hold a Tier 1 leverage ratio of nearly 10 percent, global systemically\nimportant banks hold just under 7 percent.15 Imbalanced capital requirements, combined with\nperceived market advantages, can result in disproportionate gains for large banks and their\nshareholders. As a result, large banks may capture market share, thereby encouraging community\nbanks to consolidate to compete. More work is needed in my view to tailor capital requirements\nacross bank size and business models.\nFinally, as the financial services landscape continues to evolve, regulators play an\nimportant role in providing clear expectations and timely guidance to regulated entities.

The strategies these banks pursue\nhave long been the key determinant of their success and survival in meeting their communities’\nneeds. Those strategies increasingly hinge on adopting new technology to meet the demands of a\nmobile and connected customer base and to attract talent. By doing so, bankers can lower costs,\nreach new customer segments—including underbanked populations—and drive new business\ngrowth.\nInvestments in technology can help banks meet their customers’ changing needs, gain\noperational efficiencies, improve access to an evolving payments system, and better connect\nlocal customers to the broader economy. Adoption of instant payments settlement services, for\nexample, offers the ability to provide new services that meet customer preferences for speed.\nAlongside private sector services, the Federal Reserve’s implementation next year of a new retail\npayment rail known as FedNow will allow banks of all sizes to meet household and business\ndemand for real-time payments.\nDeploying contemporary technology also can help to attract and retain a workforce with\ndiverse skillsets. This talent can, in turn, help banks identify what is needed to compete in a\nconnected, fast-paced world, and importantly, provide critical leadership succession.\n\n10\n\n\fConclusion\nThe economic vitality of thousands of communities and rural geographies depends on\nreliable access to credit and other financial services. Over the past 40 years, much has changed in\nthe delivery of those services, driven by demographics, technological innovation, and regulation.\nOver this time, community banks have continued to play an instrumental role in meeting the\nneeds of rural places and their communities. With the right mix of strategy and innovation, and a\nwell-calibrated regulatory approach, the community bank model can continue to be a trusted\ncornerstone of the U.S. financial system for thousands of households and small businesses who\nlook to them for essential credit needs and services.\n\n11\n\n\f"

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 4, 2022 \nKansas Bankers Association Annual Conference \nColorado Springs, Colo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n   \n1 \n Thank you for inviting me to join you for this year’s conference. Doug Wareham and his \nteam are key partners with the Kansas City Fed as we deliver on the Federal Reserve’s core \nmissions for monetary policy, supervision and regulation, and payment services.   \n The role of the banking industry in the U.S. economy has been central to my work  at the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  for more than 40 years.  From my first assignment as an \nexaminer  in 1982 to my current position as the Bank’s president and CEO and member of the \nFederal Open Market Committee, I have witnessed dramatic changes to the financial system  and \nthe broader economic landscape. And despite this tremendous change, it remains as true today as \nit did in 1982 that access to credit and other reliable financial services is e ssential to the success \nof local communities , households  and small businesses.   \nWith that overarching theme, my remarks today will focus on some  key developments \nthat I view as shaping the current and future community bank landscape. For example,  my own \nFederal Reserve district , which  covers the heart of the Midwest , parts of the Rocky Mountains , \nand the Southwest , has o ver the last few decades , gradually urbanized  as people moved  from \nsmall towns to  larger, more  urban centers , a trend that parallels  much of the rest of the country.1 \nThis population shift occurred as the District’s  economy became less concentrated  in energy and \nagriculture, and moved towards  service sectors and away from  manufacturing .2  \nIn the face of these changes, community banks have remain ed a vital source of banking \nservices for consumers and small business es, including being a key  provider  of reliable capital . \n \n1 Rappaport, Jordan, “ The Faster Growth o f Larger, Les s Crowded Locations ”, Economic Review , Federal Res erve \nBank of Kansas Cit y, 2018, Fourth Quarter.  \n2 See for example, Wilkerson, Chad R. and Megan D. Williams, “ The Tenth District’s Defining Industries: How Are \nThey Changing ”, Economic Review , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Third Quarter 2007, 59 -81.; Wilkerson, \nChad and Megan Williams, “ The Transformation of Manufacturing Across Federal Reserve Districts: Success for the \nGreat Plains? ”, Economic Review , Second Quarter, 2012, 111 -139.;  Felix, Alison, “ The Growing Importance of the \nServices Sector ”, Rocky Mountain Economist , March 29, 2019.  \n\n   \n2 \n When I talk to business leaders from the region, I often hear stories of how community banks \nhelp suppor t local entrepreneurs and small business owners .3 I also hear stories of the challenges \ncommunities face when locally  based banks disappear.  One business owner in our region noted \nthat after her community’s locally owned banks were acquired, she turned to lines of credit from \none of the nation’s largest banks with favorable terms.  In the midst  of a product expansion, \nhowever, the national economy turned down and the line of credit w as quickly withdrawn.  The \nexperience stood in sharp contrast to the reliable access to credit and long -term relationships with \na community bank that her  business had enjoyed across previous business cycles.  \n \nA Forty -Year Perspective on Community Banking  \nBy far, the most significant change to the community banking landscape over the past \nfour decades  has been the declin ing number of banks and increas ed concentration in the banking \nsector.  In 1985, just three years  after I began my career  with the Kansas City Fed , there were \nabout 15,000 community banks in the United States. Today, that number is less than 5,000 .4 \nSimilarly, the number of banks in my seven -state region has declined by more than  70 percent \nover that same period .5 \nMost of th e decline in the number of banks has been  due to mergers and acquisitions .6 \nAlthough community banks still represent the vast majority of bank charters, they now account \nfor only about 13 percent of bank assets  nationally  as the nation’s largest banks have \n \n3 See Skodack, Debra. “ Enduring Relevance: In an Evolving Landscape, Community Banks Remain Vital to \nCustomers and the Economy ”, Ten Magazine , Fall 2021.  \n4 Jacewitz, Stefan, “ The Increasing Brick -and-Mortar Efficiency of Community Banks ”, Economic Review , Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City, Second quarter, 2022, 19 -35. \n5 Source: Call Report s. \n6 Jagtiani, Julapa. \" Understanding the Effects of the Merger Boom on Community Banks .\" Economic Review -Federal \nReserve Bank of Kansas City  93.2 (2008): 29.  \n\n   \n3 \n significantly expanded their market share of assets and deposits .7 With a relatively rural \ngeography, the Kansas City Fed’s region still features hundreds of c ommunity banks , holding \nmore than  60 percent of total banking assets  and representing 99 percent of  banks .8  \nAs the banking system has consolidated, its role in the financial system also has shifted. \nFor example, b anks have become  a less important source of corporate credit . The share of \nbusiness loans held by banks has declined from nearly 40 percent in 1985 to less than 25 percent \ntoday, as businesses  are now  more reliant on publicly issued debt and loans from non -bank s. The \ndecline in the  number of banks may partly explain their reduced role in business lending , but it is \nnot the whole story. Other factors from outside the financial sector have also contributed to these \ndynamics , including the country’s changing demographics , increasing reliance on technology , \nand landmark regulatory changes .9   \nDemographic shifts over  the last four decades have significantly changed the  composition \nof the  U.S. population.  Since 1980, the number of Americans 65 and older has more than \ndoubled,  and the United States has become more racially and ethnically diverse. The  Hispanic \npopulation has tripled,  and the U.S. population of those of Asian descent has grown five -fold , \nlargely  through immigration.  \nThese demographic shifts have  chang ed the communities that small banks serve . Non -\nmetro counties, where large numbers of community banks operat e, have seen both slower \npopulation growth and an aging customer base. T hese counties  are also more racially and \n \n7 Hanauer, Matt, Brent Lytle, Chris Summers, and Stephanie Ziadeh, “ Community Banks’ Ongoing Role in the U.S. \nEconomy ”, Economic Review , Second Quarter, 2021, 37 -81. \n8 Source: Call Reports.  \n9 Sengupta, Rajdeep, and Jacob Dice. \" Did Local Factors Contribute to the Decline in B ank Branches? \" Economic \nReview -Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  104.3 (2019): 43 -3. \n \n\n   \n4 \n ethnically diverse today than they were decades ago , and community banks have had to adapt \nand adopt new strategies for attracting customers and employees . \n In addition to demographic  changes , technological advance ment s over the last 40 years \nhave been striking. In the financial servic es sector, these advancements have disaggregated many \ntraditional banking services. Product origination, delivery methods, and customer interact ions \nwith financial institutions have all changed dramatically. Banks are also increasingly automating \nprocesses that have historically required human interaction . Although t hese changes have \nexpedite d account management and allowed banks to leverag e more advanced modeling to \nmanage risks, they  may also have contributed to larger banks’ economies of scale. Perhaps most \nsignificantly, internet and mobile banking has allow ed banks to reach customers across the \nglobe, diminishing the necessity of geographic proxim ity. \n Technology has also foster ed competition from the broader financial services sector  with \nnew entrants promising greater speed, convenience, and flexibility in delivering financial \nservices to households and businesses. More recently, lending and paym ents platforms have \nmoved outside of the banking industry altogether . Household names in the technology sector \nsuch as Amazon, Facebook, Square, and PayPal , along with a wave of fintech startups , continue \nto pursue cutting -edge financial services . \nThese technological innovations reflect customers’ changing preferences for value and \nconvenience . In particular, the demand for fast and mobile payments  continues to grow , and \nservices providing these features are being adopted at a very r apid pace . \nAlong with payment innovation s, non -bank lenders , especially fintechs , have made \nsignificant inroads into loan  markets. Business lending by fintechs  has grown very rapidly in \nrecent years . This shift could reflect changes in  customer s’ expectation s or a considered decision \n\n   \n5 \n by banks to avoid certain risky assets.  Nonetheless, th e trend does suggest a move toward \ntransactional lending forms and away from relationship -based lending. If  these trends accelerate, \nlenders that rely heavily on technolog ical solutions  using “big-data” to reach borrowers could \nchallenge community banks’ “soft information” advantage and market share . \n Finally, regulation has been an important factor shaping the evolution of banking. Across \nthe spectrum o f regulatory changes, three aspects of regulation have factored prominently: \ngeographic deregulation, the deregulation of non -banking activities, and regulation in response to \ncrises.  \n Geographic deregulation began slowly in the late 1970s before picking up rapidly in the \n1980s. Ultimately, what started as localized  effort s to remove barriers to entry for ban ks resulted \nin federal l egislation that allow ed banks to operate and branch nationwide.10 As a result, bank \nconsolidation picked up considerably starting in the 1980s , mostly reflected in mergers of \nsmaller banks as intra - and interstate restrictions were relaxed. However, geographic \nderegulation also enabled the largest banks to begin operating nationwide  and to compete \nglobally . As market share of the largest banks increased in key loan markets , many community \nbanks looked to mergers for scale or saw their balance sheets become more concentrated as some \nbusiness lines moved to larger competitors.11  \n Through the 1990s , as banking consolidated, the largest banks also began to engage in \nwhat were traditionally considered non-banking activities, predominately securities dealing and \nunderwriting. While these activities had been prohibited at banks for close to 70 years under the \nGlass-Steagall Act, the Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act of 1999 permitted a wider array of activities at \n \n10 Rice, Tara and Phillip E. Strahan. “ Does Credit Competition Affect Small -Firm F inance? ”, The Journal of Finance , \n65(3), 2010, 861 -889. \n11 Regehr, Kristen, and Rajdeep Sengupta. \" Se ctoral Loan Concentration and B ank Performance (2001 -2014) .\" \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Working Paper  16-13 (2016).  \n\n   \n6 \n bank holding companies . In response, bank holding companies began  engaging in investment \nbanking while  also maintaining access to important safety net advantages, such as  deposit \ninsurance and access  to Federal Reserve services .  \nThe deregulation of bank s’ activities and geographic operation  produced two very \ndifferent commercial banking models . Today,  thousands of small community banks continue to \noperate in traditional business lines. At the same time,  a handful  of large banking organizations \nnow operate at such scale and are so intertwined with the financial system that their failure poses \nsystemic r isks to the global economy. As revealed during the Global Financial Crisis, large banks \nhave enjoyed some benefits from being “too big to fail.”  \nAfter the financial crisis, however, the regulatory environment changed , as it often has  \nfollowing financial and economic crises.  Regulators sought to learn from t he earlier agricultural \nbank and Savings and Loan crises of the 1980s , as well as the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 -\n2009,  and took steps to ensure a safer banking system  after eac h crisis.  The Dodd -Frank Act of \n2010, for example, made important inroads into addressing “too big to fail” advantages —though \nhow successful it was remains to be seen.  \nThe regulatory responses to these crises have generally taken a one -size -fits-all approach. \nRegulations can be blunt instruments, failing  to effectively account for the incentives and risk \nprofile s associated with the relationship lending model of many smaller banks. As a result, \ncommunity banks can bear a disproportionate burden as they implement costly compliance \nprocesses without commensurate benefit s to safety and soundness or fair access to credit .  \n \n \n \n\n   \n7 \n The Importance of Community Banks  \nEven a s new nonbank entrants become embedded in the financial services sector, the \nbanking system continues to hold a unique role in our economy. Banks remain the primary \nfinancial firm s for providing  liquidity when needed, ensur ing payments are readily transferable, \nand facilitating monetary policy  implementation .  \nFor their part, community banks continue to leverage relationship lending, with a focus \non local lending and deposit -taking . Credit decisions are based on qualitative as well as \nquantitative aspects of a borrower’s credit profile . In particular, s maller banks provide a critical \nsource of financing for small businesses.  Despite holding a fraction of the nation’s banking \nassets, community banks underwrite a sizeable 40 percent of lending to small businesses.  The \nstrength of the relationship between community banks and small businesses was highlighted  \nduring the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program. At a time w hen COVID -19 \nlockdowns threatened the viability of many small businesses, community bank s ensured that \npandemic relief funds quickly reached this segment of our economy, ultimately holding  37 \npercent of all outstanding PPP loans  serviced by banks .12  \nBeyond lending to local businesses and households, smaller banks often serve key \nleadership roles in their communities.  These bankers  sit on the boards of local schools, hospitals, \nand other civic organizations , not only meeting the credit needs of their local communities , but \nthey are also an integral part  of the m.  \nGiven th e importance of these attributes to local economies, the implications of an \nevolving financial services landscape for access to credit in rural markets, for small business, and \nfor the overall health of Main Street should be carefully considered.  Both  regulators and banks  \n \n12 Marsh, W. Blake and Padma Sharma, “ PPP Raised Community Bank Revenue but Lowered Profitability ”, \nEconomic Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, December 2020.  \n\n   \n8 \n will be influential in ensur ing these critical financial services can continue to meet the needs of \nthousands of communities, safely and efficiently.  \n \nA Message to Regulators  \n Having been handed thousands and thousands of pages of legislation intended to secure \nthe financial stability of our nation’s financial system, it’s a tall order to ask bank r egulators  to \nminimize  regulatory and supervisory burden while promoting competition and maintaining the \nsafety and soundness of the bank ing sy stem. It is made more difficult when the business models \nof banks vary from small, traditional banks to global systemically important banks . Still, in the \ninterest of meeting the range of business needs served by these institutions, I see opportunities \nfor further calibrating the supervisory framework , taking into account  the business model of \nsmall banks in three key areas: advancing risk-focused appr oaches to supervision , appropriately \ntailoring capital requirements, and providing clear er guidance around innovation and alternative \nbusiness models.  \n Over the past four decades, the volume and complexity of the data collect ed from \ncommunity banks has increased substantially. T his data  has supported both policy development \nand supervision.  Unfortunately , the time spent on the examination of an individual community \nbank has not meaningfully declined  as a result of this data coll ection . In fact, according to the \nConference of State Bank Supervisors, the most recent Community Bank Sentiment Inde x \nshowed  that community banker sentiment toward regulatory burden is at a multi -year low  and \nmore negative than any other component.13 Moreover , a large majority —81 percent of \nrespondents —expect  regulatory burden will be worse  in the future.14   \n \n13 Conference of State Bank Supervisors, “ Community Bank Sentiment Index ”, second quarter of 2022.  \n14 Ibid.  \n\n   \n9 \n Under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act ( EGRPRA ), \nregulations can be questioned for their continued effectiveness and burden.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 11, 2022 \nMid-America Labor/Management Conference \nLake Ozark, Mo.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thanks  for the invitation to join you this morning  to offer my perspective on the \necon omy and monetary policy . I expect it will come as no surprise to you that my remarks will \nfocus on inflation.   \nFor decades, inflation has been an afterthought for most Americans . Individual prices of \ngoods and services moved up and down, but overall inflation remained relatively stable. Over the \nperiod from 1991 to 2020, inflation , on average, ran  near 2 percent, the Federal Reserve’s  \nlonger -run target.   \nToday, inflation  has climbe d to 8.6 percent, the fastest pace in 40 years.1 For many \nyounger Americans, high inflation is a novel experience, while for others , the situation  may seem \nuncomfortably reminiscent of the 1970s.  Regardless, inflation is a source of considerable pain \nfor households and businesses , and a central economic challenge for policymakers.   \n  Congress has tasked the Fed eral Reserve with objectives for full employment and stable \nprices, often referred to as the Fed’s dual mandate.  To achieve those objectives, t he Fed must act \ndecisively to bring inflation down and reestablish price stability.  While the goal  is clear,  the path \nto achieving that goal is a very challenging one.  I’ll talk about som e of the considerations that are \nlikely to influence the path ahead.     \n \nA Tight Economy  \nStrong demand for goods and services has been outpacing lagging supply for some time , \nresulting in a tight economy with prices rising as a consequence . To be sure, there have been a \nnumber of specific shocks, particularly to food and energy prices, that have contributed to the increase in inflation.  Disruptions to the global market for crude oil arising from  the war in \n \n1 This figure refers to the year -over-year percent change in the consumer price index (CPI) as of May 2022.  \n\n2 \n Ukraine, along with a reduction in g lobal refining capacity after  the pandemic, have contributed \nto an almost 50 percent increase in the price of gasoline since the beginning of the year.  \nMeanwhile, the  war in Ukraine and  poor growing conditions, including in the western portion of \nthe Kansas City Fed’s region , have pushed up global food prices.   \nHowever, as you know, t oday’s high inflation story goes well beyond food and energy \nprices . Nearly every categor y tracked in the Fed’s preferred price index for goods and services \nhas recorded increases in recent months, a proportion not seen since the early 1980s.   \nWhen prices first started to move up in the spring of last year, the increases were most \nnotable among goods . Pandemic spending patterns favored the purchase of home upgrades , \nincluding gym equipment and household appliances,  over services such as restaurant meals and \nair travel.  More recently, services prices have shown stronger growth, with airfares spiking and \nrents and housing costs also increasing robustly.  \nThe broad-based nature of inflation suggests that a tight economy is driving  price \npressures rather than individual supply disruptions and shocks.  Two main factors  appear to be \ncontributing to this tightness . First, as the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand for goods \nand services surged, supported by a tremendous amount of fiscal and monetary policy  support . \nThe federal government has provided about $6 trillion of fiscal stimulus since the start of the \npandemic.  Monetary policy was also very accommodative, as the Federal Reserve cut interest \nrates to zero and added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet.  \nA second factor that seems increasingly apparent is long -lasting damage to the supply \nside of the economy  as a result of the pandemic.  Even as inflation suggests  that the economy is \noperating far above capacity, the level of real GDP remains 2  ½ percent below its pre -pandemic \ntrend , a sizable gap equal to almost a full year’s worth of growth.  One explanation for this \n\n3 \n dynamic is that that the pandemic has affected the long -run productive capacity of the economy \nby more than anticipated.  The pandemic recession was different from most recessions in that the \nservices sector was hit particularly har d. Productive capacity in services appears to have been \neliminated quickly during the pandemic, and it has been slow to come back even as demand has \nreturned, pushing up prices . \n A Tight Labor Market   \n Another factor holding back supply has been the continuing  effect  of the pandemic on the \nlabor market.  Workers have never experienced a disruption quite like the economic shut down \nthat occurred in  March 2020.  Within a matter of weeks , 20 million workers lost their jobs and the \nunemployment rate s kyrocketed from historic low s to a post -Depression  high.   \n Now, two years later, although the unemployment rate is near  its pre -pandemic level  of \n3½ percent , much has changed . For example,  the labor market appears to be much tighter now \nthan it was pre -pandemic.  One way to see this is through the Kansas City Fed’s Labor Market \nConditions Indicators ( LMC I), which take into account a broad er range of labor market measures  \nthan the unemploymen t rate alone.  These indicators  suggest that the labor market is considerably \nstronger and tighter than it was before the pandemic .\n2 Both constrained labor supply and \nexceptionally strong labor demand are shaping this outcome.  \n The labor force participation rate is still more than 1 percentage point below its pre-\npandemic level , primarily on account of lower participation among older workers, as most other \n \n2 The three -month moving a verage of the LMCI -implied unemployment ra te currently stands a t 3.29 percent. T here \nhas never been a lower reading for thi s measure  since the LMCI began in 1992. For details on the LMCI -implied \nunemployment rate, see Glover, Andy ; Jose Mustre -del-Rio; and Emily Polla rd . 2021.  “KC Fed LMCI Implies the \nLabor Market is Closer to a Full Recovery than the Unemployment Rate Alone Suggests .”  Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, Economic Bulletin , October 19.  \n\n4 \n demographic groups have largely returned to pre -pandemic norms . Some of this decline could be \nrelated to early retirement, or perhaps just more persistent retirement, as workers who have left \nthe workforce now appear less likely to return.    \n  On the other side , labor demand is historically strong.  Currently, there are about two job \nopenings per unemployed worker , the largest gap  in over 20 year s, and I hear regularly from my \ncontacts on the difficulty of keeping positions filled.   \n  Some  observers have noted that many  of these job openings may be irrelevant in \nmeasuring the tightness of the labor market since some companies appear to be testing  the \nmarket  rather than actively recruiting employees . If this is true, vacancies could decline  to more \nnormal levels without a rise in  unemployment .  \n  While low recruiting intensity may be part of the story shaping today’s labor market, I am \nnot convinced it is the  only one.  Sectors with a high number of reported vacancies, such as \neducation and health, are also reporting very solid employment growth, suggesting robust hiring. \nAt the same time, employment in these sectors is still below pre -pandemic levels, implying that \nmany positions remain to be filled.   \n  Professional and business services is another sector with a very high number of  job \nopenings  and a very solid pace of employment growth.  Interestingly, job gains  in this sector h ave \nrecently been fueled by growth in temporary help services , perhaps suggesting that employers  \nare finding it difficult to hire in a tight labor market and are substituting toward temp s. Another \npossibility is that businesses are  increasingly  turning to temp workers because they anticipate  \nthat the surge in  demand that they are experiencing will be short -lived.  \n  These different interpretations of the data underscore the high degree of  uncertainty \nregarding w here the labor market will ultimately settle.  On the one hand, if labor demand eases \n\n5 \n and job openings fall , we should expect at least some rise in the unemployment rate. On the other \nhand, labor supply could increase as pandemic  effects wane and the participation rate of older \nworke rs rises. All else equal, with more labor supply, the tightness of the labor market could ease \nwithout a substantial fall in labor demand .  \n \nMonetary Policy Considerations  \nThe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy cannot , of course , reverse the supply shocks that \nhave boosted inflation.  It can, however , moderate the pace of demand growth to narrow \nimbalances in the economy and reduce price pressures.  By doing so, its actions can also prevent \nhigh inflation from becoming embedded in price - and wage-setting behavior . For many  workers , \nrecent wage increases  have not kept pace with price in flation . Declining real , or inflation -\nadjusted , wages are not sustainable and could lead workers and businesses to build high inflation \ninto wage contracts , to the  long-term  detriment of the labor market.  Instead , experience has \nshown that low and stable  inflation  is most conducive to maintaining a strong labor market that \nbenefit s households , workers,  and businesses. To promote sustainable growth, m onetary policy \nmust therefore take decisive steps to  tighten financial conditions and bring inflation down.  \nSince March, t he policy rate has increased by 150 basis points , and the process of \nshrinking the Fed’s large balance sheet began last month.  In response to these actions, and with \nexpectations of further rate hikes, broader financial conditions have tightened, with sharp \nincreases across a spectrum of interest rates.  With the policy rate still relatively low  and a $9 \ntrillion dollar balance sheet in the early stages of shrinking , the case for continuing to remov e \npolicy accommodation is clear -cut. The speed at which interest rates should rise , however,  is an \nopen question.   \n\n6 \n I’m certainly sympathetic to th e view that interest rates need to increase rapidly, \nrecognizing that current rates are out of sync with today’s economic landscape.  However, I am \nalso mindful of how the rate of change in tightening policy can affect  households, businesses, \nand financial markets  particularly during a time of heightened uncertainty . Policy changes \ntransmit to  the economy with a lag, and significant and abrupt changes can be unsettling to \nhouseholds and small businesses a s they make necessary adjustments. It also has implications for \nthe yield curve and traditional bank lending models, such as those prevalent among community \nbanks.  For these reasons, several considerations influence my own thinking about  the appropriate \npath for policy.  \nFirst, communicati ng the path for interest rates is likely far more consequential than the \nspeed with which we get there.  Moving interest  rates  too fast raises the prospect of oversteering.  \nIt is notable that even before the March increase in the target range for the federal funds rate, \nTreasury yields had already moved up significantly and financial conditions were tightening , as \nexpectations were building for significant adjustments in mone tary policy.  And indeed, the \nadjustment has been significant.  This is already a historically swift pace of rate increases for \nhouseholds and businesses to adapt to,  and more abrupt changes in interest rates could create \nstrains, either in the economy or fi nancial markets, that would undermine the  Fed’s  ability to \ndeliver on the higher path of rates c ommunicated.  Along these lines,  I find it remarkable  that just \nfour months after beginning to raise rates , there is growing discussion of recession risk,  and \nsome forecasts are  predicting  interest rate cuts as soon as next year.  Such projections suggest to \nme that a rapid pace of rate increases brings about the risk of tightening policy more quickly than \nthe e conomy and markets can adjust.  \n\n7 \n Second, in addition to the oft -cited long and variable lags, the transmission of higher \npolicy rates and the associated tightening in financial conditions to spending, employment, and \ninflation is subject to considerable uncertainty.  For example, the shift in spending  away from \nservices to housing and durable goods during the pandemic may make the economy more \nsensitive to higher interest rates.  Another possibility is that the significant accumulation of liquid \nsavings during the pandemic will dampen the effects of higher interest rates on spending and ultimately inflation.  Given this range of outcomes, it is unclear just how high rates will need to \nmove in order to bring inflation down.  These dynamics suggest it will be particularly important \nto observe how the economy is adapting to changes in monetary policy.  \nFinally , the pace of increases in  the federal funds rate could have implications for balance \nsheet runoff.  The economy is in unfamiliar territory , with a combination of high inflation and \ntight labor markets not witnessed in decades.  Therefore, markets are understandably volatile as \nthey grapple with the many unknowns surrounding the outlook for the economy and the path of \npolicy.  Limiting the exten t to which uncertainty about the pace of interest rate adjustments \ncontributes to this volatility could be important especially as balance sheet runoff  gets underway . \nCertainly, relative to the last time balance sheet reduction was initiated in 2017, marke t \nconditions are considerably more unsettled.  To the extent that the current strains in the Treasury \nmarket can be attributed in part to heightened uncertainty about the path of policy rates , a steady \npath of rate increases, and predictably adjusting this path to incoming data, could improve \nmarket functioning and facilitate balance sheet runoff , especially as the pace of runoff \naccelerates later this year.\n3 \n \n3 See Sengupta, Rajdeep,  a nd A. Lee Smith . 2022.  “Assessing Market Conditions ahead of Quantitative Tightening .” \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City,  Economic Bulletin , forthcoming.  \n\n8 \n Making significant progress in reducing the balance sheet over the coming years  will be \nimportant in my view . After amassing more than $4.5 trillion in assets since early 2020, the \nFederal Reserve’s outsized presence in financial markets can distort the price of  duration and \nartificially flatten s the yield curve.  Unwinding the balance sheet should  reduce this distortion and \nhas the potential to steepen the yield curve, depending on the pace of increases in the funds rate.  \nRaising short -term rates much faster than  longer -term rates could further invert the yield curve \nand challenge traditional bank  lending models  as a consequence.  To the extent an inverted yield \ncurve has historically preceded recessions in the United States, such a scenario could pose yet \nanother challenge to achieving a significant reduction in the balance sheet.   \n Conclusion \nThe Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its mandate for price stability , and I \nsupport ongoing rate increases accompanied by a significant reduction in the size of the balance \nsheet to bring inflation down and make progress towards longer -run price stability.\n The pace at \nwhich this path unfolds will need to be carefully balan ced against the state of the economy and \nfinancial markets, particularly during a time of heightened uncertainty , to effectively achieve this \nobjective ."

        "content": "Monetary Policy in a Supply Constrained Economy\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMay 23, 2022\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Agricultural Symposium\nKansas City, Mo.\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fGood evening. We’re pleased to host this year’s symposium to talk about a sector of the\neconomy that is particularly important to the region we serve. I very much appreciate your\nparticipation and look forward to our discussion.\nThis year’s topic takes a close look at labor market dynamics in the agricultural sector.\nAs the title “Help Wanted in Agriculture” suggests, the availability of workers is a central\nconcern among producers. This is true not only in agriculture but across the wider economy. In\nmy remarks this evening, I’ll talk about these labor market challenges in the context of broader\neconomic conditions and will offer an outlook for the economy and for monetary policy.\nI should acknowledge at the outset that a centerpiece of any observations about the\neconomy is high inflation. After decades of low and stable prices in the United States, inflation\nhas emerged as a central challenge in the economy. Prices are moving up, and more rapidly than\nat any point in the recent past. Over the year ending in April, the consumer price index (CPI)\nrose 8.3 percent, near the fastest pace in 40 years. Steep increases in energy and food prices are\nreflected in this number, partly attributable to disrupted commodity markets following Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine. But that is not the full story. Excluding food and energy, prices increased\n6.2 percent over the last year, also near a 40-year high.\nWhen inflation first started to pick up in early 2021, a few standout categories of goods\nseemed to be driving the increase. Prices for cars (new, used, and rented) played a\ndisproportionate role in boosting the overall inflation rate, even as many other categories of\nconsumption showed little price pressure. In fact, inflation at that time was historically dispersed.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, categories of goods and services accounting for about 20 percent of\nspending recorded inflation rates significantly higher than their previous trends. An even greater\nshare, about 25 percent, were showing rates of inflation significantly below trend. However, by\nthe end of 2021, price pressures had broadened significantly, with almost 50 percent of\nexpenditures recording inflation significantly above previous trends, while the proportion of\ngoods and services with exceptionally weak inflation had collapsed to zero.\nThe inflation we are now experiencing is obviously both too high and too broad to\ndismiss. It has become a top priority for the Federal Reserve to return inflation to its 2 percent\nobjective.\n\n1\n\n\fHow did we get here?\nThe factors behind the recent increase in prices are fairly straightforward: When demand\nfor goods and services exceeds the economy’s ability to supply those goods and services, prices\nrise. The nature of this demand and supply imbalance, however, poses some challenging issues\nfor policymakers.\nAs the economy reopened throughout 2021, demand surged, supported by a tremendous\namount of policy stimulus. The federal government has provided about $6 trillion of fiscal\nstimulus since the start of the pandemic. Monetary policy was also very accommodative, as the\nFederal Reserve cut interest rates to zero and added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet.\nTogether, fiscal and monetary policy provided a massive boost to the economy, encouraging\nconsumers to spend.\nAnd spend they did, particularly on goods. Additional time at home during the pandemic\napparently allowed households to identify needs they might not have previously known they had,\nand demand for kitchen appliances, entertainment systems, and exercise equipment skyrocketed.\nAlthough purchases of durable goods have eased after jumping in the first half of last year, they\nremain about 10 percent above pre-pandemic trends.\nThe fast recovery of the labor market has also encouraged spending. The economy added\na record number of jobs in 2021. In the first four months of this year, a further 2 million jobs\nwere added, about equal to the total number of jobs created in each full year of the 2010s. More\npeople working increases incomes and supports higher spending.\nWith the amount of stimulus injected into the economy, the strength of demand is not\nparticularly surprising. Although the surge in consumption was certainly not a given recalling\nhow uncertain the course of the pandemic remained throughout 2021. What is more surprising,\nfrom my perspective, is the underperformance of the supply side of the economy. Even as\ninflation suggests that the economy is operating far above capacity, practically bursting at the\nseams, the level of real GDP remains 2½ percent below its pre-pandemic trend, a shortfall equal\nto a typical year’s worth of growth.\nThe emergence of supply constraints has put the economy in somewhat unfamiliar\nterritory. In the two decades prior to the pandemic, it was widely thought that the primary factor\nholding back economic growth was weak demand. Underlying this belief was the relative benign\nnature of inflation over this period, even in the face of historically low global interest rates and\n2\n\n\flow unemployment. An apparently low neutral rate of interest, a level known to economists as rstar, suggested that monetary policy had to work pretty hard just to keep demand in the vicinity\nof the economy’s available supply.\nNow supply constraints dominate the economic narrative. What changed? One possibility\nis that nothing has changed. Perhaps the pre-pandemic economy was closer to full capacity than\nwe realized. However, another possibility is that the pandemic has resulted in persistent, perhaps\neven permanent, damage to the productive capacity of the economy. This damage could be\nmanifested along a number of dimensions. I’ll highlight three: persistent damage to global supply\nchains, the quick destruction of capacity in the services sector, and long-lasting damage to\nworkforce engagement and labor force participation.\nPersistent disruptions to supply chains\nThe initial shock of the global shutdown in March 2020 tangled the carefully coordinated\nmovement of shipping containers, the lifeblood of global commerce, and disrupted global\nproduction networks. Although progress has been made and the line of ships waiting off the\nshore of Long Beach has diminished, disruptions have migrated to other parts of the supply\nchain. For example, warehouse space has become scarce in many markets.\nProduction and capacity have also been affected. The semiconductor shortage and its\nimpact on the automobile sector are well known, but other industries have also been hit by\nshutdowns. For example, in 2020, following a sharp fall-off in demand for diesel and gasoline, a\nnumber of refineries in the United States permanently shut down, lowering domestic refining\ncapacity by 5 percent. This loss of capacity has contributed to the run up in fuel prices this year\nas remaining capacity is running flat out.\nMore broadly, the war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply and transportation of many\ncommodities, pushing up prices for energy and food across the world. The international price of\ncrude oil has increased 40 percent since the beginning of the year, as sanctions threaten the flow\nof oil from Russia, the world’s third largest producer and a major exporter. Likewise, the price of\nnatural gas, another key Russian export, has climbed around the world, putting upward pressure\non prices for the whole constellation of goods and services for which natural gas is a key input,\nfrom electricity to fertilizer.\n\n3\n\n\fSimilar to energy markets, the prices of many agricultural commodities also surged with\nthe war in Ukraine and have remained very high. The price of wheat, for example, is about\ndouble what it was a year ago, but the prices of other major commodities are also considerably\nhigher than last year and much higher than before the pandemic. While the increase in prices has\nsupported incomes in the farm sector, I have heard many contacts in our region describe their\nangst about rising input costs, or potentially even the availability of some key inputs, such as\nfertilizer. Alongside strong incomes, the price of farmland in many parts of the country has also\nset new records, which may be positive for those who own land, but has begun to raise costs\nsubstantially for those who rent from one year to the next.\nAcross the spectrum of these supply constraints is growing concern about the persistence\nof these issues. As the efficiency of just-in-time production and global networks gives way to the\naccumulation of unproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency over efficiency, the\ndamage could prove permanent. These effects are compounded by a war that has had a dramatic\nimpact on global commodity markets and offers few signs of near-term resolution.\nThe quick destruction of capacity in the service sector\nA second factor pointing to supply-side damage can be found in the service sector of the\neconomy. Transportation and production bottlenecks have been particularly important for\nexplaining the upward movement in goods prices, but recently services prices have also been\npicking up. The 12-month change in services prices (excluding energy) reached 4.9 percent in\nApril, the fastest pace in over 30 years. In April alone, services prices increased 0.7 percent, also\na 30-year high. This jump is particularly notable because service price inflation is normally\nstable month-to-month. Over the past three decades, for example, 70 percent of the time the\nmonthly changes in services prices have hovered between 0.2 or 0.3 percent.\nThe increase in services price inflation is occurring despite continued weakness in the\nsector. Consumption of services only returned to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of this\nyear, and, if we were to extend the pre-pandemic trend growth rate, services consumption is 4\npercent below where it might have been. Given apparent slack in the services sector, why are\nprices moving up so strongly? It could be that excess capacity in the services sector disappeared\nmuch more quickly than we might have anticipated, so that even with subpar output the sector is\n\n4\n\n\fnot actually operating with much slack. Lack of labor supply is clearly part of the story (and one\nI’ll discuss later) but this sector saw capacity destruction early on.\nThe pandemic recession was different from most recessions in that demand for services\nwas hit particularly hard while demand for goods skyrocketed. Typically, the consumption of\ngoods falls more steeply than services with downward pressure on prices as slack opens up in the\neconomy. What we may be seeing in the current services-led recession is a much quicker\nadjustment of available capacity than in a typical recession. Lower fixed costs in the services\nindustry may have allowed firms to quickly eliminate excess capacity in reaction to a steep fall in\ndemand.\nTo provide a concrete example, let’s look at the market for haircuts. The real\nconsumption of haircuts has decreased by over one-third relative to pre-pandemic levels, a\ndecline likely initially attributable to social distancing and then later to the relaxed grooming\nstandards associated with working from home.\nGiven a traditional understanding of the economy, with fixed costs to adjusting capacity,\nthis sharp falloff in demand for haircuts should have resulted in a tremendous amount of slack in\nthe hairdressing industry and downward pressure on prices. However, the price of haircuts has\nnot declined, but rather recorded some of the largest increases in decades. Post-pandemic, haircut\ninflation has been running at about a 5 percent pace, the fastest pace in 40 years and about twice\nthe pre-pandemic average.\nWhy would prices rise with this sharp drop in demand? It appears that the industry\nreacted quickly to the fall in demand and cut capacity. Employment in the industry is down 15\npercent from pre-pandemic levels and has shown little movement in recent months. Interestingly,\nthere has been a large increase in the number of establishments, both barber shops and beauty\nsalons, but only locations with less than 5 employees. The number of larger establishments with\nmore than 5 employees has fallen off sharply.\nA similar, more publicized, dynamic has played out in the air travel industry. After\nplunging in the initial months of the pandemic, air travel has bounced back but remains almost\n10 percent below pre-pandemic levels. However, airfares have increased robustly over the past\nyear and are now close to 15 percent higher than their pre-pandemic level. The industry quickly\ncut capacity after air travel plummeted in the spring of 2020 and increasing capacity with the\nrevival of demand has been difficult.\n5\n\n\fContinuing labor market frictions\nThe inability of the service sector to quickly add capacity is intrinsically related to the\nthird factor holding back the supply side of the economy: continued frictions in the labor market.\nBy many metrics, the labor market appears to be unusually tight. The unemployment rate, at 3.6\npercent, is close to a historic low. The number of posted job vacancies is the highest on record,\nas is the pace at which workers are quitting their jobs, an indicator of a hot labor market as\nworkers are more likely to quit when alternative opportunities are abundant. Speaking to contacts\nin the region, hiring and retaining workers is an acute challenge. Yet, notwithstanding the\napparent tightness of the labor market, employment remains over 1 million workers short of prepandemic levels and considerably further below the pre-pandemic trend. What explains this gap?\nI will highlight two dynamics weighing on the labor force: lagging labor force participation and a\nsignificant step down in the pace of immigration.\nIn April, the percentage of the working age population participating in the labor force\nwas 1.2 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. Controlling for population growth\nand aging, this implies a gap of about 2 million workers relative to pre-pandemic levels. 1 Earlier\nin the recovery, prime age women made up a disproportionate number of the missing workers,\npossibly due to disruptions to childcare arrangements. More recently, prime age participation has\nrebounded to close to pre-pandemic levels, such that the largest contributors to the current gap in\nparticipation are workers older than 65. Participation for the 65-plus age group fell off sharply\nwith the pandemic and has not shown much recovery, perhaps as fears of illness lessened the\ndesire to work and this was a feasible option as rising asset values boosted retirement wealth.\nAnother factor contributing to the tight labor market has likely been a significant fall off\nin the number of immigrants. This issue is often highlighted by our regional contacts in the\nagricultural sector and other parts of the economy. Immigration started to move down in 2016\nand then fell off sharply during the pandemic. If immigration had continued at its earlier trend\nfor the previous five years, estimates suggest there would be an additional 3 million immigrants,\nmany of whom would have joined the workforce.2\n\nSee Tuzemen, “How Many Workers are Truly ‘Missing’ from the Labor Force?” Economic Bulletin, May 6, 2022.\nSee Cohen and Shampine, “Immigration Shortfall May be a Headwind for Labor Supply” Economic Bulletin, May\n11, 2022.\n1\n2\n\n6\n\n\fWhere do we go from here?\nWith these thorny supply side issues affecting the economy, what role does monetary\npolicy play? Certainly, monetary policy cannot fix supply shocks. But monetary policy does play\nan important role in addressing the imbalances between supply and demand. With inflation high,\nmonetary policy must act to dampen the pace of demand growth, bringing demand into\nalignment with supply and relieving pressure on prices.\nOn the supply side, for example, faster increases in production, perhaps as supply chains\ncontinue to untangle or as a greater number of workers return to the labor force, could relieve\npressure on prices as monetary policy tightens. Conversely, even further disruptions to\nproduction, from continued lockdowns in China or further fallout from the Ukraine war, could\nadd to inflation pressures and require a stronger monetary policy response.\nOn the demand side, if, as appears increasingly likely, the war proves a major drag on\nglobal growth, or if Covid lockdowns substantially dent growth in China, then lower demand\nmight take some of the heat out of inflation. However, an important wildcard in the outlook for\ndemand is the trillions of dollars of excess savings sitting in household bank accounts. These\nsavings represented a reassuring buffer early on. Now with demand hot and persistent supply\nconstraints, an abundance of liquid checking deposits could potentially make the Federal\nReserve’s job of cooling demand more challenging.\nConsiderations for the path of policy\nWith inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, the stance\nof monetary policy has belatedly shifted to the removal of accommodation. A series of interest\nrate increases combined with significant reductions in asset holdings are underway. However,\nwith real inflation-adjusted interest rates still deeply negative and the balance sheet twice its prepandemic size, questions about the path of policy are prevalent. I will provide some context on\nhow I am thinking about these questions.\nThe responsiveness of the economy to changes in the interest rate can be difficult to\npredict in part because it is likely to vary over time. For example, with consumption skewed\ntowards durable goods, which tend to be more interest-sensitive than other components of\nspending, it is possible that higher rates will have a more pronounced impact on demand and\n7\n\n\finflation than observed in the past. On the other hand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and\nhealthy household balance sheets might make consumption less reactive to higher interest rates.\nFed policymakers have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to restore price\nstability, and I expect that further rate increases could put the federal funds rate in the\nneighborhood of 2 percent by August, a significant pace of change in policy settings. Balance\nsheet reduction plans will also be underway as a tightening mechanism, with financial markets\nfar more unsettled currently than in 2017, when the Fed last initiated a rundown in the size of its\nbalance sheet. Communicating about our policy path to avoid introducing any further uncertainty\ncan ensure progress in significantly reducing the size of the balance sheet and lessening the\ncentral bank’s footprint in financial markets. Evidence that inflation is clearly decelerating will\ninform judgments about further tightening.\nThe central bank’s job is to prevent persistent imbalances from feeding into inflation and\nunmooring inflation expectations. By influencing interest rates, the Federal Reserve primarily\naffects the demand side of the imbalance. The evolution of its efforts alongside other factors will\naffect the course of monetary policy, requiring continuous and careful monitoring.\n\n8\n\n\f"

The federal government has provided about $6 trillion of fiscal \nstimulus since the start of the pandemic . Monetary policy was also very accommodative, as t he \nFederal Reserve cut interest rates to zero and added over $4 trillion to its balance sheet.  \nTogether , fiscal and monetary policy  provided a massive boost  to the economy , encourag ing \nconsumers to spend.   \n And spend they did, particularly on goods.  Additional time at home during the pandemic \napparently allowed households to identify needs they might not have previously known they had , \nand demand for kitchen appliances, entertainment systems,  and exercise equipment skyrocketed.  \nAlthough purchases of durable goods have eased after jumping in the first half of last year, they \nremain about  10 percent above pre -pandemic trends.  \n The fast recovery of the labor market has also encouraged spending.  The economy added \na record number of jobs in 2021.  In the first four months of this year, a further 2 million jobs \nwere added, about equal to the total number of jobs created in each full year  of the 2010s.  More \npeople working increases income s and supports higher spending.  \nWith  the amount of stimulus injected into the economy, the strength of demand  is not \nparticularly surprisin g. Although the surge in consumption was certainly not a given recalling \nhow uncertain the course of the pandemic remained throughout 2021.  What is more  surprising , \nfrom my perspective, is the underperformance of the supply side of the economy.  Even a s \ninflation suggests that the economy is operating far above capacity, practically bursting at the \nseams, the level of real GDP remains 2½ percent below its p re-pandemic trend, a shortfall equal \nto a typical year’s worth of growth.   The emergence of supply constraints  has put the economy in somewhat unfamiliar \nterritory.  In the two decades prior to the pandemic, it was widely thought that the primary factor \nholding back economic growth was weak demand.  Underlying this belie f was the relative benign \nnature of inflation over this period , even in the face of historically low global interest rates  and \n\n3 \n low unemployment . An apparently low neutral rate of int erest, a level known to economists as  r-\nstar, suggested that  monetary policy had to work pretty hard just to keep demand in the vicinity \nof the economy’s available supply.   \n Now supply constraints  dominate the economic narrative . What changed? One possibil ity \nis that nothing has changed.  Perhaps the pre-pandemic economy was closer to full capacity than \nwe realized.  However, another possibility is that the pandemic has resulted in persistent, perhaps \neven permanent, damage to the productive capacity of the e conomy.  This damage could be \nmanifested along a number of dimensions . I’ll highlight three : persistent damage to global supply \nchains , the quick destruction of capacity in the services sector , and long -lasting damage to \nworkforce engagement and labor force participation.  \n \nPersistent disruptions to supply chains  \nThe initial shock of the global shutdown in March  2020 tangled the carefully coordinated \nmovement of shipping containers, the lifeblood of global commerce, and disrupted global \nproduction networ ks. Although progress has been made and the line of ships waiting off the \nshore of Long Beach has diminished, disruptions have migrated to other parts of the supply \nchain.  For example, warehouse space has become scarce in many  markets.  \nProduction and capac ity have also been affected.  The semiconductor shortage and its \nimpact on the automobile sector are well known, but other industries have also been hit by shutdowns . For example, in 2020,  following a  sharp fall -off in demand for diesel and gasoline, a \nnumber of refineries in the United States permanently shut down,  lowering domestic refining \ncapacity by 5 percent.  This loss of capacity has contributed to the run up in fuel prices this year \nas remainin g capacity is running flat out .  \nMore broadly,  the war in Ukraine has disrupted the supply and transportation of many \ncommodities, pushing up prices for energy and food across the world.  The international price of \ncrude oil has increased 40 percent since t he beginning of the year, as sanctions threaten the flow \nof oil from Russia, the world’s third largest producer and a major  exporter.  Likewise, the price of \nnatural gas , another key Russian export, ha s climbed around the world, putting upward pressure \non prices for the whole constellation of goods and services for which natural gas is a key input , \nfrom electricity to fertilizer . \n\n4 \n Similar to energy markets, the prices of many agricultural commodities also surged with \nthe war in Ukraine and have remained very high. The price of wheat, for example, is about \ndouble what it was a year ago, but the prices of other major commodities are also considerably \nhigher than last year and much higher than before the pandemic. While the increase in prices has \nsupported income s in the farm sector, I have heard many contacts in our region describe their \nangst about rising input costs, or potentially even the availability of some key inputs, such as \nfertilizer. Alongside strong incomes, the price of farmland in many parts of the country has also \nset new records, which may be positive for those who own land, but has begun to raise costs \nsubstantially for those who rent from one year to the next.  \nAcross the spectrum of these supply constraints is growing concern about the persistenc e \nof these issues. As the efficiency of just -in-time production and global networks gives way to the \naccumulation of unproductive inventories and a preference for resiliency  over efficiency , the \ndamage could prove permanent . These effects are compounded by a war that has had a dramatic \nimpact on global commodity markets  and offers few signs of near-term  resolution.    \n \nThe quick destruction of capacity  in the service sector \n A second factor pointing to supply-side damage can be found in the service sector of the \neconomy. Transportation and production bottlenecks have been particularly important for \nexplaining the upward movement in goods prices, but recently  services pri ces have also been \npicking up.  The 12-month change in services prices  (excluding energy)  reached 4.9 percent in \nApril, the fastest pace in over 30 years.  In April alone, services prices increased 0.7 percent, also \na 30-year high.  This jump is particularly notable because service  price inflation  is normally \nstable month-to -month . Over the past three decades, for example, 70 percent of the time the \nmonthly changes in services prices have  hovered between 0.2 or 0.3 percent.   \nThe increase in services price inflation is occurring despite continued weakness in the \nsector.  Consumption of services only returned to pre -pandemic levels in the first quarter of this \nyear, and , if we were to extend the pre-pandemic trend growth rate, services consumption is 4 \npercent below where it might have been . Given apparent slack in the services sector , why are \nprices moving up so strongly?  It could be that  excess capacity in the services sector  disappeared \nmuch more quickly than we might have anticipated, so that even with subpar output the sector is \n\n5 \n not actually operating with much slack.  Lack of labor supply is clearly part of the story (and one \nI’ll discuss later) but this sector saw capacity  destruction  early on.   \nThe pandemic recession was different from most  recession s in that demand for services \nwas hit particularly hard while demand for goods skyrocketed.  Typical ly, the consumption of \ngoods fall s more steeply than services  with downward pressure on prices as slack  opens up in the \neconomy.  What we may be  seeing in the current services -led recession is a much quicker \nadjustment of available capacity than in a typical recession.  Lower fixed costs in the services \nindustry may have allowed firms to quickly eliminate excess capacity in reaction to a steep fall in \ndemand.  \nTo provide a concrete example , let’s look at the market for haircuts.  The real \nconsumption of haircuts ha s decreased  by over one -third  relative to pre -pandemic levels, a \ndecline likely initially attributable to social distancing and then later to the relaxed grooming \nstandards associated with work ing from home.  \nGiven a traditional understanding of the economy , with fixed costs to adjusting capacity, \nthis sharp falloff in demand for haircuts  should have resulted in a tremendous amount of slack in \nthe hairdressing industry and downward pressure on prices.  However, the price of haircuts has \nnot declined, but rather recorded some of the large st increases  in decades.  Post-pandemic, haircut \ninflation has been running at about a 5 percent pace, the fastest pace in 40 years and about twice \nthe pre -pandemic average.  \nWhy would prices rise with this sharp drop in demand? I t appears that the industry \nreacted quickly to the fall in  demand and cut capacity.  Employment in the industry is down  15 \npercent from pre -pandemic levels and has shown little movement in recent months.  Interestingly, \nthere has been a large increase in the number of establishments, both barber shops and beauty \nsalons, but only locations with less than 5 employees.  The number of l arger e stablishments with \nmore than 5 employees ha s fallen off sharply.   \nA similar, more publicized, dynamic has played out in the air travel industry.  After \nplunging in the initial months of the pandemic, air travel has bounced back but remains almost \n10 percent below pre -pandemic levels.  However, airfares have increased robustly over the past \nyear and are now close to 15 percent higher than their pre -pandemic level.  The industry quickly \ncut capacity  after air travel plummeted in the spring of 2020 and increasing capacity with the \nrevival of demand has been difficult.  \n\n6 \n  \nContinuing labor market frictions  \nThe inability of the service sector to quickly add capacity is intrinsically related to the \nthird factor holding back the supply side of the economy : continued frictions in the labor market.  \nBy many metrics , the labor market appears to be unusually tight . The unemployment rate, at 3.6 \npercent, is close to a historic low.  The number of posted job vacancies is the highest on record, \nas is the pace at whi ch workers are quitting their jobs , an indicator of a hot labor market as \nworkers are more likely to quit when alternative opportunities are abundant . Speaking to contacts  \nin the region , hiring and retaining workers is a n acute challenge.  Yet, notwithstanding the \napparent tightness  of the labor market, employment remains over 1 million workers short of pre -\npandemic levels and considerably further below the pre -pandemic trend.  What explains this gap?  \nI will highlight two dynamics weighing on the labor force : lagging labor force participation and a \nsignificant step down in the pace of immigration.   \nIn April, the percentage of the working age population participating in the labor force  \nwas 1.2 percentage points lower than before the pandemic.  Cont rolling for population growth \nand aging, this implies a gap of about 2 million workers relative to pre -pandemic levels.1 Earlier  \nin the recovery , prime  age women made up a disproportionate number of the missing workers, \npossibly due to disruptions to chil dcare arrangements.  More recently, prime age participation has \nrebounded to close to pre -pandemic levels, such that the largest contributors  to the current gap in \nparticipation are workers older than 65.  Participation for the 65-plus  age group fell off sharply \nwith the pandemic and has not shown much recovery, perhaps as fears of illness lessened the desire to work and this was a feasible option as rising asset values boosted retirement  wealth.  \nAnother factor contributing to the tight labor market has  likely been a significant fall off \nin the number of  immigrants.  This issue is often highlighted by our regional contacts in the \nagricultural sector and other parts of the economy. Immigration started to move down in 2016 and then fell off  sharply during the pandemic.  If immigration ha d continued at its earlier  trend \nfor the previous  five years , estimates suggest there would be an additional 3 million  immigrants, \nmany of whom would have joined the workforce .\n2 \n \n1 See Tuzemen , “How Many Workers are Truly ‘Missing’ from the Labor Force? ” Economic Bulletin, May 6, 2022.  \n2 See Cohen and Shampine , “Immigration Shortfall May be a Headwind for Labor Supply ” Economic Bulletin , May \n11, 2022 .  \n\n7 \n  \nWhere do we go from here?  \nWith these thorny supply side issues affecting the economy, what role does monetary \npolicy play?  Certainly, monetary policy cannot fix  supply shocks.  But monetary policy does play \nan important role in addressing the imbalances between supply and demand. With inflation high, \nmonetary policy must act  to dampen the pace of demand growth, bringing demand into \nalignment with supply and relieving pressure on prices.   \nOn the supply side, for example, faster increases in production, perhaps as supply chains \ncontinue to untangle or as a greater number of workers return to  the labor force, c ould relieve \npressure on prices as m onetary policy tighten s. Conversely, e ven further disruptions to \nproduction, from continued lockdowns in China or further fallout from the Ukraine war, could \nadd to inflation pressures and require a stronger monetary policy response.   \nOn the demand side, if, as appears increasing ly likely, the  war proves a major drag on \nglobal growth, or if Covid lockdowns  substantially dent growth  in China, then lower demand \nmight take some of the heat out of inflation.  However, an important wildcard in the outlook for \ndemand is the trillions of dollars of excess savi ngs sitting in household bank  accounts.  These \nsavings represented a reassuring buffer  early on . Now with demand hot and persistent supply \nconstraints , an abundance of liquid checking deposits could potentially make the Federal \nReserve ’s job of c ooling demand more challenging.   \n  \nConsiderations for the path of policy  \n With inflation at a 40 -year high and the unemployment rate near record lows , the stance \nof monetary policy has belatedly shifted  to the removal of accommodation . A series of interest \nrate increases combined with significant reductions in asset holdings are underway. However, with real inflation -adjusted interest rates still deeply negative and the balance sheet twice its pre-\npandemic size, questions about the path of policy are prevalent.  I will provide some context on \nhow I am thinking about these questions.  \n The responsiveness of the economy to changes in the interest rate can be difficult to \npredict in part because it is likely to vary over time . For example, with consumption skewed \ntowards durable goods, which tend to be more interest -sensitive than other components of \nspending, it is possible that higher rates will have a more pronounced impac t on demand and \n\n8 \n inflation than observed in the past. On the other hand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and \nhealthy household balance sheets might make consumption less reactive  to higher interest rates.  \n Fed policymakers have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to r estore price \nstability, and I expect that further rate increases could put the federal funds rate in the \nneighborhood of 2 percent by August, a significant pace of change in policy  settings . Balance \nsheet reduction plans will also be underway as a tighteni ng mechanism, with financial markets \nfar more unsettled currently than in 2017, when the Fed last initiated a rundown in the size of its  \nbalance sheet.  Communicating about our policy path to avoid introducing any further uncertainty \ncan ensure progress in significantly reducing the size of the  balance sheet and lessening the \ncentral bank’s footprint in financial markets.  Evidence that inflation is clearly decelerating will \ninform judgments about further tightening.  \n  The central bank’s job is to prevent persistent imbalances from feeding into inflation and \nunmooring inflation expectations. By influencing interest rates, the Federal Reserve primarily \naffects the demand side of the imbalance. The evolution of its efforts alongside other factors wil l \naffect the course of monetary policy, requiring continuous and careful monitoring."

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nMarch 30, 2022\nThe Economic Club of New York\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fMy thanks to the Economic Club of New York for the invitation to speak. I look forward\nto today’s conversation.\nThe economy is emerging from the shadow of the pandemic. Public health restrictions are\nbeing lifted, workers are commuting again, and things are beginning to return to normal, even if\nthere is a good chance that “normal” isn’t quite the same normal that we left behind. Over the\npast two years, there was an unprecedented use of the word “unprecedented” to describe the\neconomy. And understandably so. We had a record decline in jobs, then a record rebound. A\nhistoric drop in output followed by a historic gain. All supported by a previously unimagined\nlevel of fiscal and monetary policy support. That it was an “unprecedented” time in the nation’s\neconomy is no exaggeration.\nNow as many of us return to our offices after a two-year hiatus and dust off our desks, the\neconomy faces yet another challenge: high inflation. Instead of calling it unprecedented,\nhowever, I often hear people suggest that the current economy has an uncomfortable\nresemblance to that of the 1970s with inflation now running at a pace not seen since that era.\nWithout elaborating on what I view as important differences between now and the 1970s, the\nfocus on high inflation is undebatable.\nFor policymakers, understanding the nature of today’s inflation dynamics is essential.\nHow will the extraordinary shock of the pandemic play out relative to the dynamics that have\nshaped economies over time, and what lessons can be drawn from past inflationary periods?\nBoth aspects are relevant in my view to how the economy is likely to evolve, particularly as it\nrelates to inflation.\nIn my remarks this afternoon, I will offer my views on the factors I see shaping the\noutlook for economic activity and inflation, and how those factors inform my thinking about the\nappropriate path for monetary policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Demand, Supply, and Inflation\nConsumers continue to spend, and the underlying fundamentals for consumption are\npositive. Retail sales adjusted for inflation increased 9 percent over the 12 months ending in\nFebruary, far above the average 2½ percent pace observed in the decade prior to the pandemic.\nThis burst of consumption has been particularly apparent for long-lasting durable goods as the\n1\n\n\fpandemic scrambled typical spending patterns away from services, such as gyms, restaurants,\nand movie theaters, and towards goods, such as treadmills, kitchen appliances, and home\nentertainment systems. Although there is good reason to think spending patterns will eventually\nreturn to pre-pandemic trends, the demand for goods has shown only modest signs of abating so\nfar, and spending on many services remains depressed.\nOverall consumption has been supported by strong income growth. Since the beginning\nof 2020, personal income has increased at a faster rate than in any two-year period in the past 15\nyears, first as the result of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits and then with\nthe rapid recovery in the labor market with employment increasing and wages rising. Households\nnow hold over $2 trillion in additional savings relative to pre-pandemic trends, positioning them\nwith the capacity to spend.\nThis robust demand has outpaced the available supply of goods and services, especially\nas pandemic-related disruptions continue to weigh on product and labor markets, and\ngeopolitical conflict has further impeded the supply of many commodities.\nProduction bottlenecks and shortages originated in the rapid closing and subsequent slow\nreopening of the economy during the pandemic. The range of disruptions across factories and\nacross countries has jumbled global supply chains, as have disruptions to transportation\nnetworks. Signs of improvement are slowly emerging. The New York Fed’s index of global\nsupply chain pressures fell notably in January and February, and inventories rose faster at the end\nof 2021 than any time since 2015, suggesting that companies are finding ways to work around\nthese constraints.\nA lack of labor also has been an important supply constraint. Contacts in my region\ncontinue to express concern about labor shortages. These reports align with the data, reflecting\nthe ratio of job openings per unemployed person near all-time highs and workers quitting jobs at\na record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent in\nFebruary while wage gains have been picking up in recent months.\nStill, many workers remain on the sidelines. In February, the labor force participation rate\nremained 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level. Taking into account the trend decline\nin participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of roughly 2 million workers.\nUnderstanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor market, and how persistent these\n\n2\n\n\ffactors are, will be important for determining how quickly the economy will grow, as well as the\nsplit between output growth and higher inflation.\nWhy have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key\nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In February, 1.2 million people reported\nnot being in the labor force because of Covid. Throughout the pandemic, issues in childcare\navailability have stood out as a key constraint on labor force participation. And here things are\nnot yet back to normal. Employment in daycare facilities, a proxy for capacity, has only slowly\nrecovered and remains 11 percent below pre-pandemic levels. However, it is not only childcare.\nEmployment in nursing and residential care facilities has declined some 12 percent since the\nbeginning of 2020, and it has shown almost no recovery to date. This substantial shift in family\ncare responsibilities towards households may take some time to resolve.\nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the\nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are generally not\nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the\npandemic could have in elevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much\nof the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect workers moving from\nemployment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to\nwork. 1 In normal times, there is a regular flow of retired individuals who move back into\nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest or in other cases out of necessity. During the\npandemic it appears as though more retirees decided to stay retired, perhaps related to pandemic\nconcerns or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and\nfinancial security. A change associated with either reason could bring some fraction of these\nworkers back over time.\nThese supply constraints in the face of strong demand are pushing up inflation to a 40year high. CPI inflation was nearly 8 percent in February, with core inflation, stripping out food\nand energy prices, at 6.4 percent. Initially, the run-up in inflation was primarily associated with a\nfew specific goods, particularly cars (new, used, and rented). This led to assumptions that such\nprice pressures would dissipate. But rather than being short-lived, inflation has broadened its\nreach. Currently, inflation for almost half of a typical consumer’s purchase bundle is far above a\nfive-year average. Consumer sentiment has plummeted as a result.\n1\n\nWhat Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)\n\n3\n\n\fThe outlook for inflation will be affected in several ways. Supply constraints can be\nexpected to ease as workers re-enter the labor force and transportation and production networks\nuntangle, taking some pressure off inflation. The timeline for seeing this relief is highly\nuncertain. Demand growth is also expected to cool, as fiscal policy becomes less expansionary\nand monetary policy accommodation is removed to stabilize prices. That process is just getting\nunderway.\nAt present, global dynamics pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Although the\npandemic has fortunately taken a backseat in the U.S., effects continue to be felt in other parts of\nthe world with the capacity to disrupt. The U.K. and Europe are witnessing rising case counts as\nan even newer variant takes hold. A particularly saliant risk is the continued threat of lockdowns\nin China as that country’s zero-Covid strategy runs up against ever more transmissible variants.\nShutdowns, of course, will aggravate already disrupted global supply chains, likely boosting\nprices, even as the lockdowns could weigh on China’s demand and global growth.\nAdditionally, the conflict in Ukraine presents a variety of risks to the outlook, both on the\nsupply and the demand side. Prices have moved up sharply for a number of commodities, both as\nUkrainian production has been affected and as sanctions limit Russian exports. Given Russia’s\nimportance in global energy production, we have seen a sharp rise in oil and natural gas prices.\nThe conflict has further boosted inflation, and it threatens to extend or worsen supply chain\ndisruptions.\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nAgainst this backdrop of high inflation, last week, the FOMC began adjusting the stance\nof policy. The Committee raised the policy rate by 25 basis points and signaled that it will soon\nbegin the process of running down the Fed’s balance sheet.\nGiven the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment\nrate near record lows, it is clear that removing accommodation is required. How much and how\naggressively accommodation should be removed is far more uncertain.\nReal interest rates—that is, the interest rate adjusted for the pace of inflation—remain\nhighly negative, encouraging borrowing and consumption. In addition, the balance sheet now\nstands at a record $9 trillion. By holding a substantial share of U.S. Treasury debt as well as\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS), these asset holdings are putting significant downward\n4\n\n\fpressure on longer-run interest rates, by some estimates lowering the yield on the 10-year\nTreasury by 150 basis points. 2 All in all, monetary policy is likely as accommodative as it has\never been at a time when inflation is well above the Fed’s target and labor markets are tight.\n\nConsiderations in the Removal of Accommodation\nWith the current stance of monetary policy out of sync with the state of the economy,\npolicymakers face a challenging set of global and domestic dynamics as they begin the process\nof removing accommodation. My own thinking about the approach to removing accommodation\nis influenced by several considerations.\nThe first takes into account continued risks to the outlook associated with further\npandemic-related disruptions in Europe and Asia as well as spillovers from the Russia-Ukraine\nconflict. While much of the economic fallout so far has been directed towards further disruptions\nto supply, both of these risks have implications for demand as well as supply. Assessing the\nbalance in real time will be difficult. Recognizing these risks is not an argument for stalling the\nremoval of accommodation, but it does suggest a steady, deliberate approach for the path of\npolicy could provide space to monitor developments as they unfold.\nAnother consideration for policymakers is judging how responsive economic activity is\nto the level of the interest rate. This responsiveness is likely to change over time and with the\nstate of the economy. For example, with consumption skewed towards durable goods, which tend\nto be more interest-sensitive than other components of spending, it is possible that higher rates\nwill have a more pronounced impact on the economy than observed in the past. On the other\nhand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and healthy household balance sheets might make\nconsumption more resilient to higher interest rates, requiring a steeper path of rate increases to\nslow demand growth and bring inflation down. A steady, deliberate approach to removing\naccommodation will allow policymakers to observe where this equilibrium might be.\nFinally, the interaction of higher policy rates with a large balance sheet will need to be\nconsidered. Raising short-term rates while the balance sheet continues to depress longer-term\nyields will contribute to a flattening and inversion of the yield curve. Already, as markets have\nanticipated a rapid increase in short-term rates, the spread between the yield on the 2-year and\nThe summary of estimates reported in Swanson (2021) imply that the Federal Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of\nfederal agency and longer-term Treasury debt is depressing the 10-year Treasury yield by roughly 150 basis points.\n2\n\n5\n\n\f10-year Treasury bond turned negative yesterday. While many factors influence longer-term\nyields, including the growth outlook, foreign demand for Treasuries, and the quantity and\nmaturity of Treasury debt issuance, the Fed’s asset holdings also play a role. These purchases\naimed to depress long-term rates, and the roll-off of these assets is likely to put some upward\npressure on those rates, possibly steepening the yield curve.\nMy concern about an inverted yield curve does not reflect its intensely debated value as a\npredictor of recession. Rather, my view is that an inverted curve has implications for financial\nstability with incentives for reach-for-yield behavior. An inverted yield curve also pressures\ntraditional bank lending models that rely on net interest margins, or the spread between\nborrowing short and lending long. Community banks in particular rely on net interest margins to\nmaintain their profitability, with rural areas especially dependent on community banks.\nAs the FOMC begins the process of removing accommodation, not only will the policy\nrate need to rise, but the balance sheet will need to decline significantly. Negative real rates and a\nlarge balance sheet have distortive effects. For example, by owning roughly one-quarter of the\nMBS market along with a significant portfolio of longer-term Treasuries, our presence in\nfinancial markets muddies price signals, encourages excessive risk-taking, and can foster\nfinancial instability. Asset prices remain historically high and remain vulnerable to economic and\npolicy uncertainty.\nGiven the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment\nrate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate. At the\nsame time, the factors I noted earlier, including monitoring risks, the responsiveness of activity\nto interest rate changes, and yield curve developments will be important guides to that pace in\nmy view.\nThe degree to which fading disruptions contribute to an easing of inflation and the lags of\npolicy actions will be relevant for what happens after more-neutral policy settings are\naccomplished. If at that point inflation shows signs of remaining elevated, more restrictive policy\nmay be required to meet our price stability objective and to reinforce an anchoring of inflation\nexpectations.\n\n6\n\n\fConcluding Thoughts\nThe start of a tightening cycle is always fraught with challenges. The public’s focus\nquickly pivots from asking “When will they start?” to “When will they stop?”\nThe previous tightening cycle initiated in December 2015 proved to be a difficult\ntransition. Although the initial rate increase was almost fully expected, it soon became apparent\nthat “expected” was not the same as “understood.” And it proved challenging to articulate a\ncompelling narrative for the path of policy throughout 2016.\nOf course, today’s policy landscape is quite different. The rationale for removing\naccommodation is not difficult when inflation is high, demand is strong, and the labor market is\nhot. Under those conditions, a soft landing is possible but not guaranteed. While an outlook of\neasing supply constraints and moderating demand growth is consistent with inflation stepping\ndown even as the labor market remains strong, less favorable outcomes are certainly possible. In\nthe event high inflation persists while demand turns down, and the labor market falters,\npolicymaker resolve could be tested.\nIf the assumption of temporary pandemic effects on supply and demand proves to be\noverstated, and the imbalance between strong demand and lagging supply persists, the potential\nto dislodge inflation expectations and price-setting dynamics will further complicate\npolicymakers’ task. Here the comparison to the 1970s is apparent, when persistently high\ninflation over several years led to the unanchoring of inflation expectations that then became\nembedded in price and wage setting behavior.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 30, 2022 \nThe Economic Club of New York \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n My thanks to the Economic Club of New York for the invitation to speak.  I look forward \nto today’s conversation.   \nThe economy is emerg ing from the shadow of the pandemic . Public health r estrictions are \nbeing lifted, workers are commuting again , and things are beginning to return to normal, even if \nthere is a good chance that “normal ” isn’t quite  the same normal that we left behind.  Over the \npast two years, there was an unprecedented use of the word “unprecedented”  to describe the \neconomy.  And understandably so.  We had a record decline in jobs, then a record rebound.  A \nhistoric drop in output foll owed by a historic gain.  All supported by a previously unimagined \nlevel of  fiscal and monetary policy support.  That it was an “unprecedented” time in the  nation’s \neconomy is no exaggeration . \nNow as many of us return to our offices after a two-year hiatus  and dust off our desks, the \neconomy faces yet another challenge:  high inflation.  Instead of calling it unprecedented , \nhowever, I often hear people suggest that the current economy has an uncomfortable \nresemblance to that of the 1970s  with inflation now running at a pace not seen since that era.  \nWithout elaborating on what I view as important differences between now and the 1970s, the \nfocus on high inflation is undebatable . \nFor policymakers, understanding the nature of today’s inflation dynamics is essential.  \nHow will the extraordinary shock of the pandemic play out relative to the dynamics that have \nshaped economies over time, and what lessons can be drawn from past inflationary periods?  \nBoth aspects are relevant in my view to how the economy is likely to evolve, particularly as it \nrelates to inflation.   \n In my remarks  this afternoon , I will offer my views on the factors I see shaping the \noutlook for economic activity and inflation, and how those factors inform my thinking about the appropriate path for monetary policy.    \n \nThe Outlook for Demand, Supply , and Inflation \nConsumers continue to spend , and the underlying fundamental s for consumption are \npositive . Retail sales adjusted for inflation increased 9 percent over the 12 months ending in \nFebruary, far above the average 2½ percent pace observed in the decade prior to the pandemic.  \nThis burst of consumption has been particularly apparent for long -lasting durable goods  as the \n\n \n2 \n pandemic scrambled typical spending patterns away from services, such as gyms, restaurants,  \nand movie theaters , and  towards goods, such as treadmills, kitchen appliances , and home \nentertainment systems.  Although there is good reason to think spending patterns will eventually \nreturn to pre -pandemic trends, the demand for goods has shown only modest signs of abating  so \nfar, and spending on many services remains depressed .  \nOveral l consumption has been supported by strong income growth.  Since the beginning \nof 2020, personal income has increased at a faster rate than in any two-year period in  the past 15 \nyears, first as the result of stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefi ts and then with \nthe rapid recovery in the labor market with employment increasing and wages rising.  Households \nnow hold over $2 trillion in additional savings relative to pre -pandemic trends , positioning them \nwith the capacity to spend.    \nThis robust demand has outpaced the available supply of goods and services , especially \nas pandemic-related disruptions continue to weigh on product and labor markets , and \ngeopolitical conflict has further impeded the supply of many commodities .  \nProduction bottlenecks and shortages  originated  in the rapid closing and subsequent slow \nreopening of the economy during the pandemic. The range of disruptions across factories and \nacross countries has jumbled global supply chains , as have disruptions to tr ansportation \nnetworks. Signs of improvement are s lowly  emerging . The New York Fed’s index of global \nsupply chain pressures fell notably in January and February, and inventories rose faster at the end of 2021 than any time since 2015, suggesting that compan ies are finding ways to work around \nthese constraints . \nA lack of labor also has been an important supply constraint. Contacts in my region \ncontinue to express concern about labor shortages. These reports align with the data, reflecting \nthe ratio of job ope nings per unemployed person near all -time highs and workers quitting jobs at \na record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.8 percent in \nFebruary while wage gains have been picking up in recent months .  \nStill, many wor kers remain on the sidelines.  In February, the labor force participation rate \nremained 1 percentage point below its pre -pandemic level. Taking into account the trend decline \nin participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of roughly 2 m illion workers. \nUnderstanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor market, and how persistent these \n\n \n3 \n factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the economy will grow, as well as the \nsplit between output growth and higher inflation.   \nWhy have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key \nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In February, 1.2 million pe ople reported \nnot being in the labor force because of Covid. Throughout the pandemic, issues i n childcare \navailability have stood out as a key constraint on labor force participation.  And here things are \nnot yet back to normal.  Employment in daycare facilities, a proxy for capacity, has only slowly \nrecovered and remains 1 1 percent below pre -pandemi c levels. However, it is not only childcare. \nEmployment in nursing and residential care facilities has declined some 12 percent since the \nbeginning of 2020, and it has shown almost no recovery  to date.  This substantial shift in family \ncare responsibilities towards households  may take some time to resolve .  \nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the \nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are generally not \nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the pandemic could have in elevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much of the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect workers moving from employment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to work.\n1 In normal times, there is a regular flow of retired individuals who move back into \nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest  or in other cases out of necessity. During the \npandemic it appears as though more retirees decid ed to stay retired, perhaps related to pandemic \nconcern s or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and \nfinancial security. A c hange associated with either reason could bring some fraction of these \nworkers back over time . \nThese supply constraints in the face of strong demand are  pushing  up inflation  to a 40-\nyear high.  CPI inflation was nearly 8 percent in February, with  core inflation, stripping out food \nand energy prices, at 6.4 percent.  Initially , the run-up in inflation was primarily associated with a \nfew specific goods, particularly cars  (new, used, and rented ). This led to assumptions that such \nprice pressures would dissipate.  But rather tha n being short -lived , inflation has broadened its \nreach . Currently, inflation for almost half of a typical consumer’s purchase bundle is far above  a \nfive-year average.  Consumer sentiment has plummeted as a result.  \n \n1 What Has Driven the Recent Increase in Retirements? - Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (kansascityfed.org)  \n\n \n4 \n The outlook for inflation will be affected in several ways.  Supply constraints can be \nexpected to ease as workers re-enter the labor force and transportation and production networks \nuntangle , taking some pressure off inflation.  The timeline for seeing this relief is highly \nuncertain.  Demand growth is also expected to cool, as fiscal policy becomes less expansionary \nand monetary policy accommodation is removed to stabilize prices . That process is just getting \nunderway.  \nAt present, g lobal dynamics p ose upside risks to th e inflation outlook.  Although the \npandemic has fortunately taken a backseat in the U.S., effects continue to be felt in other parts of \nthe world with the capacity to disrupt . The U.K. and Europe are witnessing rising case counts as \nan even newer variant takes hold.  A particularly saliant risk is the continued threat of lockdowns \nin China as that country’s zero-Covid strategy runs up against ever more transm issible  variants.  \nShutdowns, of course, will aggr avate already disrupted global supply chains, likely boosting \nprices, even as the lockdowns could weigh on China’s demand and global growth.   \nAdditionally , the conflict in Ukraine presents a variety of risks to the outlook, both on the \nsupply and the demand side.  Prices have moved up sharply for a number of commodities, both as \nUkrainian production has been affected  and as sanctions limit Russian exports.  Given Russia’s \nimportance in global energy production, we have seen a sharp rise in oil and natural gas prices . \nThe conflict has further boost ed inflation, and it threatens to extend or worsen supply chain \ndisruptions.    \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nAgainst this backdrop of high inflation, l ast week, the FOMC began adjusting the stance \nof policy.  The Committee raised the policy rate by 25 basis points and signal ed that it will soon \nbegin the process of running down the Fed’s  balance sheet.   \nGiven the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment \nrate near record lows, it is clear that removing accommodation is required . How much and how \naggressively accommodation should be removed  is far more uncertain .  \nReal interest rates —that is, the interest rate adjusted for the pace of inflation —remain  \nhighly negative, encouraging borrowing and consumption.  In addition , the balance sheet now \nstands at a record $9 trillion.  By holding a substantial share of U.S. Treasury debt  as well as \nmortgage -backed securities  (MBS), these asset holdings are putting significant downward \n\n \n5 \n pressure on longer -run interest rates, by some estimates lowering the yield on the 10-year \nTreasury by 150 basis points.2 All in all, monetary policy is likely as accommodative as it has \never been at a time when inflation is well above the Fed’s target and labor markets are tight.   \n \nConsiderations in the Removal of Accommodation  \nWith the current stance of monetary policy out of sync with the state of the economy, \npolicymakers face a challenging set of global and domestic dynamics as they begin the proc ess \nof removing accommodation.  My own thinking about the approach to removing accommodation  \nis influenced by several considerations . \nThe f irst takes into account co ntinued risks to the outlook  associated with further \npandemic -related disruptions in Europe and Asia as well as spillovers from the Russia -Ukraine \nconflict.  While m uch of the economic fallout so far has been directed towards further disruptions \nto supply, both of these risks have implications for demand  as well as supply. Assessing the \nbalance in real time will be difficult.  Recognizing t hese risks is not an argument for stalling the \nremoval of accommodation, but it does suggest a steady , deliberate approach for the path of \npolicy could provide space to monitor developments as they unfold. \nAnother consideration for policymakers is judging how responsive economic activit y is \nto the level of the interest rate . This responsiveness is likely to change over time and with the \nstate of the economy . For example, with consumption skewed towards durable goods , which tend \nto be more interest -sensitive than other components of spending, it is possible that higher rates \nwill have a more pronounced impact on the economy than observed in the past.  On the other \nhand, high levels of liquidity in the economy and healthy household balance sheets might make \nconsumption more resilient to higher interest rates, requiring a steeper path of rate increases to slow demand growth and bring inflation down . A steady , deliberate approach to removing \naccommodation will allow policymakers to observe where this equilibrium might be .  \nFinally, the interaction of higher policy rates with a large balance sheet  will need to be \nconsidered . Raising short -term rates while the balance sheet continues to depress longer -term \nyields will contribute to a flattening and inversion of the yield curve . Already, as market s have \nanticipated a rapid increase in short -term rates, the spread between the yield on the 2-year and \n \n2 The summary of estimates reported in Swanson (2021)  imply that the Feder al Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of \nfederal agency a nd longer -term Treasury debt is depressing the 10 -year Treasury yield by roughly 150 basis points.  \n\n \n6 \n 10-year Treasury  bond turned negative yesterday . While many factors influence longer -term \nyields, including the growth outlook, foreign demand for Treasuries, and the quantity and \nmaturity of Treasury debt issuance , the Fed’s asset holdings also play a role . These purchase s \naimed to depress long -term rates , and the roll-off of these assets is likely to put some upward \npressure on those rates , possibly steepening the yield curve . \nMy concern about an inverted yield curve does not reflect its intensely debated  value as a \npredictor of recession.   Rather, my view is that an inverted curve  has implications for financial \nstability  with incentives for reach -for-yield behavior . An inverted yield curve also pressures  \ntraditional bank lending models that rely on net interest margins, or the spread between borrowing short and lending long. Community banks in p articular rely on net interest margins to \nmaintain their profitability, with rural  areas especially dependent on community banks.   \nAs the FOMC begins the process of removing accommodation, not only will the policy \nrate need to rise, but the balance sheet will need to decline significantly.  Negative real rates and a \nlarge balance sheet have distortive effects . For example, b y owning roughly one -quarter of the \nMBS market along with a significant portfolio of longer -term Treasuries, our presence in \nfinancial markets muddies  price signals, encourages excessive risk -taking, and can f oster \nfinancial instability.  Asset prices remain historically high and remain vulnerable to economic and \npolicy uncertainty.  \n Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment \nrate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate.  At the \nsame time, the factors I noted e arlier, including monitoring risks, the responsiveness of activity \nto interest rate changes, and yield curve developments  will be important guide s to that pace in \nmy view .  \nThe degree to which fading disruptions contribute to an easing of inflation and the lags of \npolicy actions will be relevant  for what happens after more -neutral  policy settings are \naccomplished . If at that point inflation shows signs of remaining elevated, more restrictive policy \nmay be required to meet our price stability objective and to reinforce an anchoring of inflation expectations.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n Concluding Thoughts  \nThe start of a tightening cycle is always fraught with challenges . The public ’s focus \nquickly pivot s from asking “When will they start?” to “When will they stop?”   \nThe previous tightening cycle initiated in  December 2015  proved to be a difficult \ntransition.  Although the initial rate increase was almost fully expected, it soon became apparent \nthat “expect ed” was not the same as “understood.”  And it proved challenging to articulate a \ncompelling narrative for the path of policy throughout 2016 .  \nOf course, today’s policy landscape is quite different.  The rationale for removing \naccommodation is not difficult when inflation is high, demand is strong, and the labor market is \nhot. Under those conditions, a  soft landing is possible but not guaranteed.  While an outlook of \neasing supply constraints and moderating demand growth is consistent with inflation stepping \ndown even as  the labor market remains strong, less favorable outcomes are certainly possible.  In \nthe event high inflation persists while  demand turns down , and the labor market falters , \npolicymaker resolve could be tested.  \nIf the assumption of tem porary pandemic effects on supply and demand proves to be \noverstated, and the imbalance between strong demand and lagging supply persists , the potential \nto dislodge inflation expectations and price -setting dynamics  will further complicate \npolicymakers’ task . Here the comparison to the 1970s is apparent, when persistently high \ninflation over several years led to the  unanchoring of inflation expectations that then beca me \nembedded in price and wage setting behavior.  Unlike that period, however, Fed policymakers \ntoday have emphasized a commitment to act expeditiously to restore price stability . \nStill, the landscape we face is murk y. Uncertainty and risks  seem likely to accompany \neach step on the path to policy normalization, demanding equal doses of flexibility  and resolve ."

        "content": "The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy\n\nRemarks by\nEsther L. George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 31, 2022\nThe Economic Club of Indiana\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThanks to the Economic Club of Indiana for inviting me to speak today. I’m pleased to be\nhere in person, something I no longer take for granted after the experience of the past two years,\nto share my thoughts on the economy during this extraordinary time.\nThe global pandemic hit the U.S. in full force two years ago and although its effects are\nstill with us, the U.S. economy rebounded quickly. Looking back, 2021 saw several notable\neconomic developments, including the largest increase in employment on record as well as the\nmost significant pick-up in inflation in decades. The effects of a global pandemic and the\nextraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal and monetary, drove those outcomes and\nwill likely continue to set the course for the economy this year.\nI’ll talk about three key dimensions that will influence economic activity in the coming\nyear: the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the outlook for monetary policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Demand\nThe outlook for demand is a positive one. Spending was robust at the end of last year,\nwith retail sales in the fourth quarter almost 20 percent higher than the same period in 2020, the\nlargest annual increase on record. With the new year, the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the\nOmicron variant has muddled the picture somewhat. Real GDP increased a solid 6.9 percent in\nfourth quarter, but the surge in new cases has led many forecasters to revise down their\nprojections for the beginning of the year, even though there is a generally held view that\neconomic activity, and spending in particular, has become more resilient to spikes in the virus.\nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to\nsupport solid consumption growth. Notably, household income continues to increase rapidly.\nNominal labor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in\n\n1\n\n\femployment and wages. With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, more\npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy. This is particularly true\nfor the wage gains going to lower-income workers, a group that has traditionally spent a\nrelatively large share of their paychecks.\nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by healthier household balance sheets.\nSignificant fiscal transfers, along with subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed many to\naccumulate savings and pay down debt. Households now have over $2 trillion in additional\nsavings relative to pre-pandemic trends, and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house\nprices near record highs, have also boosted wealth. While it is possible that households could\ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic,\nmany have the capacity to spend.\nAnother factor supporting demand growth is a robust outlook for state and local\ngovernment spending. With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget\nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021. And while fiscal policy at the federal level is\nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels,\nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the\nlargest increase in 15 years.\nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the persistence of the virus is likely to\nfurther delay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the\npast two years. Throughout the pandemic, consumers have favored the purchase of goods,\nparticularly durable goods. For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential\nremodeling and upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances. It also inspired purchases\nof home exercise equipment and bicycle sales. Although durable goods consumption has fallen\n\n2\n\n\ffrom its peak, the level remains 10 percent higher than its pre-pandemic trend, and there are\nindicators it might be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases. This is\nparticularly true for automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.\nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as\nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances and movies, and\nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists. The same is true with business travel still\ndisrupted; hotels and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the\nmiddle seat of an overbooked flight).\n\nThe Outlook for Supply\nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services, 2021 saw supply lag demand\nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods. The result was higher prices. With\noverall demand expected to remain strong, a key question for the outlook is whether supply will\nbe able to keep up, particularly as the ongoing public health concerns related to the pandemic\nthreaten to delay a rotation of consumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack\nservices sector. Whether or not supply is able rise to the occasion in part will be determined by\nthe persistence of pandemic-related disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor\nmarkets.\nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to production bottlenecks and shortages,\nmany originating in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy in 2020.\nThe range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled global supply\nnetworks, as have disruptions to transportation networks, including the carefully choreographed\nmovement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collapsing in disarray. Slowly,\n\n3\n\n\fthese disruptions are being dealt with, and there are indications that the worst has passed as\nshipping rates have peaked and port backlogs are being cleared. Imports and inventories both\nincreased sharply in the fourth quarter, suggesting that supply is on the mend. Reports of supplier\ndelivery delays declined in December even as they remain at historically elevated levels. Still,\nglobal supply networks continue to face risks, particularly those going through China where a\nzero-Covid policy and strict lockdowns are running up against the highly transmissible Omicron\nvariant.\nA lack of labor also has been an important constraint on supply. Speaking to contacts in\nmy region, reports of acute labor shortages are prevalent. These reports align with the data,\nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near all-time highs and workers\nquitting jobs at a record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling\nbelow 4.0 percent in December and wage growth picking up solidly.\nThis tight labor market reflects the strength of demand but also constraints on the supply\nof labor. In December, the labor force participation rate remained 1.5 percentage points below its\npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months. Taking into account the\ntrend decline in labor force participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of\nroughly 3.5 million workers. Understanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor\nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the\neconomy will grow, as well as the split between output growth and higher inflation.\nSo why have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key\nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In December, more than a million\nworkers reported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime-age workers and\ndisproportionately women. Throughout the pandemic, issues in childcare availability surfaced as\n\n4\n\n\fa key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likely to be prolonged by the\nrecent surge in the virus and renewed school closures. Employment in daycare facilities remains\n10 percent below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to recover.\nHowever, it is not only children. Employment in nursing and residential care facilities has\ndeclined 12 percent relative to the start of 2020, suggesting that there has been a substantial shift\nin family care responsibilities towards households during the pandemic.\nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the\nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are largely not\nattributing their lack of workforce participation to the pandemic, I would not dismiss its role in\nelevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much of the increase in the\nreported retired population does not reflect workers moving from employment to retirement but\nrather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to work. In normal times, there is a\nregular flow of retired individuals who move back into employment, in some cases out of\npersonal interest or in other cases out of necessity. Today, it appears as though more retirees are\ndeciding to stay retired, perhaps because of concern over illness or as buoyant equity and\nhousing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and financial security. If concern over illness\nis a prime motivating factor, some fraction of these workers may decide to return to the\nworkforce as the pandemic fades.\nOf course, the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential\nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets. We are already\nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce with absenteeism disrupting\nbusiness activity and production. This dynamic has been particularly apparent in the airline\nindustry, as a lack of employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel. It will also\n\n5\n\n\flikely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines waiting for\nthe situation to improve.\nThe ongoing influence of the virus has obviously added uncertainty to the outlook.\nHowever, I don’t expect it has changed the overall picture of strong demand continuing to push\nup on constrained supply.\n\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy? Monetary policy plays an\nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating\nthe growth of demand. When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and longrun growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary policy that moderates\nthe pace of demand growth. By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up,\nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.\nMonetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of accommodation to the\neconomy. With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real interest rates, or interest rates\nadjusted for inflation, are near record lows. In addition to the low policy rate, the Fed has\nincreased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large amounts of Treasuries and\nmortgage-backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings to nearly $9 trillion. By\nremoving securities from the market, these purchases apply notable downward pressure on\nlonger-term interest rates and lower borrowing costs. Asset valuations also respond as investors\nseek returns in alternative and perhaps riskier investments.\nWith inflation running at close to a 40-year high, considerable momentum in demand\ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very\n\n6\n\n\faccommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook. At last\nweek’s meeting, the FOMC acknowledged the need to shift its policy settings with interest rate\nincreases and significant reductions in asset holdings on the horizon.\nRemoving accommodation is easily justified, but it is unavoidably complicated by the use\nof multiple policy instruments, as it was during the last normalization cycle less than a decade\nago. To guide this process, the FOMC released a set of general principles for reducing the size of\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These principles keep the federal funds rate as the primary\ntool of policy adjustments with planned significant reductions in the balance sheet to begin after\nthe policy rate had increased. The principles also reaffirm the Committee’s ample reserves\noperating regime and an intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long-run, moving\naway from holding mortgage-backed securities to minimize possible distortions in credit\nallocation.\nThese principles establish important guideposts as the Federal Reserve begins to dial\nback its policy settings. However, they are just a start, and a number of important and difficult\ndecisions remain. In particular, I expect it will be important to consider the interaction between\nreductions in the size of the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate. What we do on the\nbalance sheet will likely affect the path of policy rates and vice versa. For example, more\naggressive action on the balance sheet could allow for a shallower path for the policy rate.\nAlternatively, combining a relatively steep path of rate increases with relatively modest\nreductions in the balance sheet could flatten the yield curve and distort incentives for private\nsector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater economic and financial\nfragility by prompting reach-for-yield behavior from long-duration investors.\n\n7\n\n\fIn the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjusting the size of the balance\nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way.” The rationale for this\ntiming was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for space to\noffset any unexpected turbulence. This rationale seems less compelling now and, from my\nperspective, discounts the yield curve implications of moving the funds rate higher while\nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, it could be appropriate to move earlier on the\nbalance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.\nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the principles state an intention to\nmaintain securities holdings in an amount needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and\neffectively in an ample reserves regime. I expect that this will be an amount that will be difficult\nto identify with any precision, particularly as the banking sector’s demand for reserves is likely\nto evolve over time, perhaps in ways that is hard to predict. While it might be tempting to err on\nthe side of caution, the potential costs associated with an excessively large balance sheet should\nnot be ignored.\nI would describe those costs in three aspects. One is the distortive effects of the size of\nthe Fed’s balance sheet on the financial system. A large Fed presence in markets can displace\nprivate activity, even in a market as large and liquid as that for U.S. Treasuries and certainly\nwhere the central bank holds roughly 1/4 of the MBS market. This presence can distort price\nsignals, currently most evident in the pricing of duration. By holding long duration assets, the\nFed’s balance sheet is depressing the price of duration, by lowering longer-term yields by as\nmuch as 1.5 percentage points according to some rules-of-thumb, incentivizing reach-for-yield\nbehavior and increasing fragility within the financial system. 1 As we purchased assets, our goal\nThe summary of estimates reported in Swanson (2021) imply that the Federal Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of\nfederal agency and longer-term Treasury debt is depressing the 10-year Treasury yield by roughly 150 basis points.\n1\n\n8\n\n\fwas in part to artificially depress term premia, pushing down long-run rates and supporting\neconomic activity. In normalizing our balance sheet, we should aim to eliminate this\ndistortion.\nSecond, and related, maintaining a large balance sheet reduces available policy space in\nthe inevitable next downturn. With the zero lower bound likely to bind for short-term rates, the\ntrend decline in long-term rates has also decreased the amount of policy space we have at the\nlonger end of the curve. Just as increases in the policy rate provide us with space to cut shortterm rates, decreasing the size of our balance sheet, and increasing term premia, could provide\nspace to push down long-run yields in the next downturn. 2\nFinally, a large balance sheet has the potential to intertwine fiscal and monetary policy in\nthe public’s eyes and could unintentionally pose risks to the Fed’s independence and authority. 3\nIn a rising rate environment, this risk could become more apparent as interest paid on the large\nstock of reserve liabilities grows.\nWith these costs in mind, we are likely to face a different set of challenges and\nconsequential decisions than we did with our previous experience with balance sheet\nadjustments. In following through on these principles for reducing our asset holdings, the\ndifferences are notable, considering the current balance sheet is historically large relative to the\nsize of the economy, and the economy itself is in a far different place.

        "content": "The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy  \n \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nJanuary 31, 2022 \nThe Economic Club of Indiana  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Thanks to the Economic Club of Indiana for inviting me to speak today. I’m pleased to be \nhere in person, something I no longer take for granted after the experience of the past two years, \nto share my thoughts on the economy during this extraordinary time.  \nThe global pandemic hit the U.S. in full force two years ago and although its effects are \nstill with us, the U.S. economy rebounded quickly. Looking back, 2021 saw several  notable \neconomic developments , including the largest increase in employment on record as well as the \nmost significant pick -up in inflation in decades . The effects of a global pandemic and the \nextraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal and monetary, drove those outcomes  and \nwill likely continue to set the course for the economy this year .  \nI’ll talk about three key dimensions  that will influ ence economic activity in the coming \nyear: the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the outlook for  monetary policy.   \n The Outlook for Demand   \nThe outlook for demand is a positive one.  Spending was robust  at the end of last year, \nwith retail sales in the fourth quarter almost 20 percent higher than the same period in 2020, the \nlargest annual increase on record. With the new year,  the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the \nOmicron variant has muddled the picture  somewhat . Real GDP increased a solid 6.9  percent in \nfourth quarter, but t he surge in new cases has led  many forecasters to revise  down the ir \nprojections  for the beginning of the year, even though there is a generally  held view that \neconomic activity, and spending  in particular , has become more resilient to spikes in the virus.  \nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to \nsupport solid consumption growth.  Notably, household income  continue s to increase rapidly.  \nNominal la bor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in \n\n2 \n employment  and wages.  With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, m ore \npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy.  This is p articularly true \nfor the wage gains going to lower -income workers, a group that has traditionally spent a \nrelatively large share of their paychecks.  \nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by health ier household balance sheets.  \nSignificant f iscal tran sfers, along with  subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed  many  to \naccumulate saving s and pay down debt.  Households now have over $2 trillion in additional \nsaving s relative to pre -pandemic trends , and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house \nprices near record highs , have also boosted wealth.  While it is possible that households could \ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic, \nmany have the capacity to spend.  \nAnother factor suppor ting demand growth is a robust outlook for s tate and local \ngovernment spending . With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget  \nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021.  And while fiscal policy at the federal level is \nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels, \nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the \nlargest increase in 15 years.   \nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the persistence of the virus is likely to  \nfurther delay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the \npast two years . Throughout  the pandemic,  consumers have favored the purchase of goods, \nparticularly durable goods . For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential \nremodeling and upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances . It also inspired purchase s \nof home exercise eq uipment and bicycle sales.  Although durable goods consumption has fallen \n\n3 \n from its peak, the level remains 10 percent higher than  its pre-pandemic trend, and there are \nindicators it might be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases . This  is \nparticularly true for automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.   \nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as \nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances a nd movies, and \nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists.  The same is true with business travel still \ndisrupted; hotels  and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the \nmiddle seat of a n overbooked flight) .  \n \nThe Outlook for Supply  \nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services , 2021 saw supply lag demand \nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods . The result was higher prices . With \noverall demand expected to remain strong , a key question for the outlook is whether supply will \nbe able to keep up, particularly as the ongoing public health concerns related to the pandemic \nthreaten to delay a rotation of consumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack \nservices  sector . Whether or not supply is able rise to the occasion in part will be determined by \nthe persistence of pandemic-related disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor markets.   \nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to product ion bottlenecks and shortages, \nmany originating in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy in 2020.  \nThe range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled gl obal supply \nnetworks, as ha ve disruptions to transportation networks , including the carefully choreographed \nmovement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collaps ing in disarray.  Slowly, \n\n4 \n these disruptions are being dealt with , and there are i ndications that the wors t has passed  as \nshipping rates have peaked  and port backlogs are being cleared.  Imports and inventories both \nincreased sharply in the fourth quarter, suggesting that supply is on the mend. Reports of supplier \ndelivery delays declined in December  even as they remain at historically elevated level s. Still, \nglobal  supply networks continue to face risks, particularly those going through China where a \nzero-Covid policy and strict lockdowns are running up against the highly transmissible O micron \nvariant.   \nA lack of l abor also has been an  important constraint on supply.  Speaking to contacts in \nmy region, reports of acute labor shortages  are prevalent . These reports align with  the data , \nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near  all-time high s and workers \nquitting jobs at a record pace.  The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate f alling  \nbelow 4.0 percent in December  and wage growth picking up solidly.   \nThis tight labor market reflects the strength of demand but  also constrain ts on the supply \nof labor . In December, t he labor force participation rate remain ed 1.5 percentage points below its \npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months.  Taking into account the \ntrend decline in labor force participation as the po pulation ages, this amounts to a shortage of \nroughly 3.5 million workers.  Understanding w hat is keeping these workers out of the labor \nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the \neconomy will grow, as wel l as the split between output growth and higher inflation.   \nSo why have workers left the labor market?  The pandemic likely remains a key \nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly . In December , more than a million \nworkers reported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime -age workers and \ndisproportionately  women . Through out the pandemic , issues in childcare availability surfaced as \n\n5 \n a key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likel y to be prolonged by the \nrecent surge in the virus and renewed school closures.  Employment in daycare facilities remains \n10 percent below pre -pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to recover.  \nHowever, it is not only children. E mploym ent in nursing and residential care facilities has \ndeclined 12 percent relative to the start of 2020, suggesting that  there has been a substantial shift \nin family care responsibilities  towards households during the pandemic.   \nAnother contributor to lower l abor force participation has been a large increase in the \nproportion of the  population that report s being retired.  While these workers are largely not \nattributing their lack of workforce participation to the pandemic, I would not dismiss its role in \nelevating the retirement rate . Looking  at detailed data, it appears much of the increase in the \nreported retired population does not reflect  workers moving from employment to retirement but \nrather a sharp slowdown in the number of retir ees returning to work.  In normal times , there is a \nregular flow of retired individuals who move  back into employment, in some cases out of \npersonal interest or in other cases out of necessity.  Today, it appears as though more retirees are \ndeciding to stay retired, perhaps because of concern over illness or as buoyant equity and \nhousing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs and financial security.  If concern over illness \nis a prime motivating factor, some fraction  of these workers may decide to return to  the \nworkforce as the pandemic fades.  \nOf course,  the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential \nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets.  We are already \nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce  with absenteeism disrupti ng \nbusiness activity and production.  This d ynamic has been particularly apparent in the airline \nindustry, as a lack of employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel.  It will also \n\n6 \n likely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines waiting for \nthe situation to improve.   \nThe ongoing influence of the virus has obviously added uncertainty to the outlook .  \nHowever , I don’t expect it has changed the overall picture  of strong demand continuing to push \nup on constrained supply.  \n \nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy \nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy?  Monetary policy plays an \nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating the growth of demand.  When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and long -\nrun growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary po licy that moderates \nthe pace of demand growth.  By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up, \nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.  \nMonetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of accommodation to the \neconomy.  With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real interest rates, or interest rates \nadjusted for inflation, are near  record lows.  In addition to the low policy rate, the Fed has \nincreased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large amounts of T reasuries and \nmortgage -backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings to nearly $9 trillion. By \nremoving securities from the market, these purchases apply notable  downward pressure on \nlonger -term interest rates and lower borrowing costs. Asset valuations also respond as investors \nseek returns in alternative and perhaps riskier investments.   \nWith inflation running at close to a 40 -year high, considerable momentum in demand \ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very \n\n7 \n accommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook . At last \nweek’s meeting, the FOMC acknowledged the need to shift its policy settings with interest rate \nincreases and significant reductions in asset holdings  on the horizon.  \nRemoving accommodation is easily justified, but it is unavoidably complicated by the use \nof multiple policy instruments , as it was during the last normalization cycle less than a decade \nago. To guide this process, the FOMC released a set of general principles for reducing the size of \nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These principles keep  the federal funds rate as the primary \ntool of policy adjustments with  planned significant reductions in the balance sheet to begin after \nthe policy rate had increased . The principles also reaffirm the Committee’s ample reserves \noperating regime and an intention to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long -run, moving \naway from holding mortgage -backed securities to minimize possible distortions in credit \nallocation.   \nThese principles  establish important guideposts as the Federal Reserve begins to dial \nback  its policy settings . However, they are just a start, and a number of important and difficult \ndecisions remain. In particular, I expect it will be important to consider the interaction  between \nreductions in the  size of the balance sheet and increases in the policy  rate. What we do on the \nbalance sheet will likely affect the path of policy rates and vice versa. For example, m ore \naggressive action on the balance sheet could allow for a shallower path for the policy rate. Alternatively, combining a  relatively steep path of rate increases with relatively modest \nreductions in the balance sheet  could flatten the yield curve and distort incentives for private \nsector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater economic and financial \nfragility by prompting reach-for -yield behavior from long -duration investors.   \n\n8 \n In the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjus ting the size of the balance \nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way .” The rationale for this \ntiming  was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for space to \noffset any unexpected turbulence. T his rationale seems less compelling now  and, from my \nperspective, discounts the yield curve i mplications of moving the funds rate higher while \nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, it could be appropriate to move earlier on the \nbalance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.   \nRegarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet, the principles state an intention to \nmaintain securities holdings in an amount needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and \neffectively in an ample reserves regime.  I expect that this will be an amount that will be difficult \nto identify with any precision, particularly as the banking sector’s  demand for reserves is likely \nto evolve over time , perhaps in ways that is hard to predict . While it might be tempting  to err on \nthe side of caution, the potential costs associated with an excessively large balance sheet  should \nnot be ignored.    \nI would describe those costs in three aspects.  One is the distortive effects of the size of \nthe Fed’s balance sheet  on the financi al system.  A large Fed presence in markets can displace \nprivate activity, even in a market as large and liquid as that for U .S. Treasuries and certainly \nwhere the central bank holds roughly 1/4 of the MBS market. This presence can distort price signals, cu rrently most evident in the pricing of duration.  By holding long duration assets, the \nFed’s balance sheet is depressing the price of duration, by lowering longer -term yields by as \nmuch as 1. 5 percentage points  according to some rules -of-thumb , incentivizing reach -for-yield \nbehavior and increasing fragility within the financial system.\n1 As we purchased assets, our goal \n \n1 The summary of  estimates reported in  Swanson (2021)  imply that the Federal Reserve’s $6.9 trillion holdings of \nfederal agency a nd longer -term Treasury debt is depressing  the 10 -year Treasury  yield by roughly 150 basis points.   \n\n9 \n was in part to artificially depress term premia, pushing down long -run rates and supporting \neconomic activity . In normalizing our balance sheet , we should aim to eliminate this \ndistortion.       \nSecond, and related, maintaining a large balance sheet reduces available policy space in \nthe inevitable next downturn.  With the zero lower bound  likely to  bind for short -term rates, the \ntrend decline in long -term rates has also decreased the amount of policy space we have at the \nlonger end of the curve.

George\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\n\nJanuary 11, 2022\nThe Central Exchange\nRemarks delivered virtually\nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve\nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.\n\n\fThank you, Ann. It’s a pleasure to begin this New Year with the Central Exchange. This\nis an important organization for women in Kansas City who contribute actively to our\ncommunity in so many different ways, and it provides an important forum to share ideas,\nexperiences and opportunities. The Kansas City Fed supports these goals, and I’m pleased that\nwomen play an important role on the Boards of Directors of our four offices, on our executive\nmanagement team, and across all aspects of our public mission. In fact, several members of our\nleadership team are members of the Central Exchange, and I know their involvement has\nbenefited them personally and professionally.\nIt’s also an honor to begin the New Year by continuing the tradition of sharing my\noutlook for the economy here at the Central Exchange, something I first did in January 2012\nshortly after I became president of the Kansas City Fed. It was a time of recovery in the U.S.\neconomy after a terrible financial crisis and Federal Reserve policymakers were deliberating on\nhow and when to unwind an extraordinary monetary policy response.\nA decade later, the U.S. economy again finds itself recovering from an unprecedented\nshock with Federal Reserve policymakers contemplating how and when to unwind an\nunprecedented monetary policy response. To be clear, the challenges we face today are quite\ndifferent in many respects even as the uncertainty that accompanies policymaking choices has\nfamiliar refrains.\nLooking back, 2021 saw several notable economic developments, including the largest\nincrease in employment on record as well as the most significant pick-up in inflation in decades.\nThe effects of a global pandemic and the extraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal\nand monetary, drove those outcomes and will likely continue to set the course for the economy\nthis year.\n\n1\n\n\fIn my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about three key dimensions that will influence\neconomic activity in the coming year: the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the\noutlook for monetary policy.\n\nThe Outlook for Demand\nThe outlook for demand is a positive one. Spending was robust going into the holiday\nseason, with November retail sales edging up following a large jump in October. Recent\nindicators point to continued strong demand even as the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the\nOmicron variant threatens to muddle the picture somewhat. With newly reported cases now at\nall-time highs, many forecasters are revising down their projections for the beginning of the year,\nthough there is a generally held view that economic activity, and spending in particular, has\nbecome more resilient to spikes in the virus.\nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to\nsupport solid consumption growth. Notably, household income continues to increase rapidly.\nNominal labor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in\nemployment and wages. With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, more\npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy. This is particularly true\nfor the wage gains going to lower-income workers, a group that has traditionally spent a\nrelatively large share of their paychecks.\nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by healthier household balance sheets.\nSignificant fiscal transfers, along with subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed many to\naccumulate savings and pay down debt. Households now have over $2 trillion in additional\nsavings relative to pre-pandemic trends, and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house\n\n2\n\n\fprices near record highs, have also boosted wealth. While it is possible that households could\ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic,\nmany have the capacity to spend.\nAnother factor supporting demand growth is a robust outlook for state and local\ngovernment spending. With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget\nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021. And while fiscal policy at the federal level is\nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels,\nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the\nlargest increase in 15 years.\nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the surge in the virus is likely to further\ndelay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the past two\nyears. Throughout the pandemic, consumers have favored the purchase of goods, particularly\ndurable goods. For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential remodeling\nand upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances. It also inspired purchases of home\nexercise equipment and bicycle sales. Although durable goods consumption has fallen from its\npeak, the level remains 10 percent higher than its pre-pandemic trend, and there are indicators it\nmight be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases. This is particularly true\nfor automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.\nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as\nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances and movies, and\nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists. The same is true with business travel still\ndisrupted, hotels and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the\nmiddle seat of an overbooked flight).\n\n3\n\n\fThe Outlook for Supply\nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services, 2021 saw supply lag demand\nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods. The result was higher prices. With\noverall demand expected to remain strong, a key question for the outlook is whether supply will\nbe able to keep up, particularly as the Omicron variant threatens to delay a rotation of\nconsumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack services sector. Whether or\nnot supply is able rise to the occasion in part will be determined by the persistence of pandemicrelated disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor markets.\nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to production bottlenecks and shortages,\nmany originating in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy during the\npandemic. The range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled global\nsupply networks, as have disruptions to transportation networks, including the carefully\nchoreographed movement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collapsing in\ndisarray. Slowly, these disruptions are being dealt with, and there are indications that the worst\nhas passed as shipping rates have peaked and port backlogs are being cleared. Reports of supplier\ndelivery delays declined in December even as they remain at historically elevated levels.\nA lack of labor also has been an important constraint on supply. Speaking to contacts in\nmy region, I hear consistent reports of labor shortages. These reports align with the data,\nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near all-time highs and workers\nquitting jobs at a record pace. The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate falling\nto 3.9 percent in December and wage growth picking up solidly. The strength of the labor market\n\n4\n\n\fis even more apparent within some parts of our region, with the unemployment rate in Nebraska\ndropping to 1.8 percent, a record low for any state.\nThis tight labor market reflects the strength of demand but also constraints on the supply\nof labor. In December, the labor force participation rate remained 1.5 percentage points below its\npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months. Taking into account the\ntrend decline in labor force participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of\nroughly 3.5 million workers. Understanding what is keeping these workers out of the labor\nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the\neconomy will grow, as well as the split between output growth and higher inflation.\nSo why have workers left the labor market? The pandemic likely remains a key\nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly. In December, 1.1 million persons\nreported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime-age workers and\ndisproportionately women. Throughout the pandemic, issues in childcare availability have stood\nout as a key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likely to be prolonged\nby the recent surge in the virus and renewed school closures. Employment in daycare facilities\nremains 10 percent below pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to\nrecover. However, it is not only children. Employment in nursing and residential care facilities\nhas declined 12 percent relative to the start of 2020, suggesting that there has been a substantial\nshift in family care responsibilities towards households during the pandemic.\nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the\nproportion of the population that reports being retired. While these workers are largely not\nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the\npandemic could have in elevating the retirement rate. Looking at detailed data, it appears much\n\n5\n\n\fof the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect workers moving from\nemployment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to\nwork. In normal times, there is a regular flow of retired individuals who move back into\nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest or in other cases out of necessity. During the\npandemic it appears as though more retirees are deciding to stay retired, perhaps because of\nconcern over illness or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs\nand financial security. If concern over illness is a prime motivating factor, some fraction of these\nworkers are likely to return as the pandemic fades.\nOf course, the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential\nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets. We are already\nseeing some signs of its impact on the health of the workforce with disruption to business\nactivity and production. This dynamic surfaced in the airline industry over the holidays, as a lack\nof employees led to the cancellation of flights and disrupted travel. The surge in the virus will\nalso likely weigh on labor force participation as potential workers remain on the sidelines\nwaiting for the situation to improve. While this new variant has added uncertainty to the outlook,\nI don’t believe it has changed the overall picture of strong demand continuing to push up on\nconstrained supply.\n\nThe Outlook for Monetary Policy\nWhat does this outlook imply for the path of monetary policy? Monetary policy plays an\nimportant role in shaping the balance of demand and supply by either encouraging or moderating\nthe growth of demand. When demand looks to overwhelm supply, economic stability and long-\n\n6\n\n\frun growth prospects are best served by a less accommodative monetary policy that moderates\nthe pace of demand growth. By smoothing out demand growth to allow supply time to catch up,\nmonetary policy can support the strong and steady expansion of economic activity.\nBy many metrics monetary policy is currently providing a historic amount of\naccommodation to the economy. With the policy rate near zero and inflation elevated, real\ninterest rates, or interest rates adjusted for inflation, are near record lows. In addition to the low\npolicy rate, the Fed has increased significantly the size of its balance sheet, purchasing large\namounts of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities and more than doubling its asset holdings\nto over $8.5 trillion. By removing securities from the market, these purchases apply notable\ndownward pressure on longer-term interest rates while pushing investors to look for alternative\nand perhaps riskier investments.\nWith inflation running at close to a 40-year high, considerable momentum in demand\ngrowth, and abundant signs and reports of labor market tightness, the current very\naccommodative stance of monetary policy is out of sync with the economic outlook. Even after\naccounting for the FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to accelerate the timeline for\nending asset purchases, the balance sheet will grow further until March.\nRemoving accommodation will unavoidably be complicated by the use of multiple policy\ninstruments – short term rates and large-scale asset purchases – as it was during the last\nnormalization cycle a decade ago. As policymakers chart a course for withdrawing this\naccommodation, it will be important in my view to consider the interaction between the ultimate\nsize of the balance sheet and the longer-run normal funds rate. All else equal, maintaining a large\nbalance sheet could imply a higher short-term interest rate to offset the stimulative effect of the\nbalance sheet’s continued downward pressure on longer-term interest rates. An approach of\n\n7\n\n\fraising rates while maintaining an outsized balance sheet could flatten the yield curve and distort\nincentives for private sector intermediation, especially for community banks, or risk greater\neconomic and financial fragility by prompting reach-for-yield behavior from long-duration\ninvestors. For that reason, my own preference would be to opt for running down the balance\nsheet earlier rather than later as we plot a path for removing monetary accommodation.\nIn the previous normalization cycle, the FOMC delayed adjusting the size of the balance\nsheet until the normalization of the funds rate was “well under way.” The rationale for this\ntiming was predicated on the novelty of balance sheet normalization and the desire for space to\noffset any unexpected turbulence. This rationale seems less compelling now and, from my\nperspective, discounts the yield curve implications of moving the funds rate higher while\nmaintaining a large balance sheet. All in all, I believe that it will be appropriate to move earlier\non the balance sheet relative to the last tightening cycle.\nEven as the pandemic continues to influence economic activity, the time has come to\ntransition monetary policy away from its current crisis stance towards a more normal posture in\nthe interest of long-run stability. With robust demand, high inflation, and a tight labor market,\npolicymakers will need to grapple with the appropriate speed and magnitude of adjustments\nacross multiple policy tools as they work to achieve their long-run objectives for employment\nand price stability. That transition could be a bumpy one, with the prospect of asset valuation\nadjustments and the recalibration of supply and demand towards a new equilibrium.\n\n8\n\n\f"

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nJanuary 11, 2022 \nThe Central Exchange  \nRemarks delivered virtually  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Thank you, Ann.  It’s a pleasure to begin this New Year with the Central Exchange. This \nis an important organization for women in Kansas City who contribute actively to our \ncommunity in so many different ways , and it provides an important forum to share ideas, \nexperiences and opportunities. The Kansas City Fed suppo rts these goal s, and I’m pleased that \nwomen play an important role on the Boards of Directors of our four offices , on our executive \nmanagement team , and across all aspects of our public mission . In fact, several members of our \nleadership team are members o f the Central Exchange, and I know their involvement has \nbenefited them personally and professionally.  \nIt’s also an honor to begin the New Year by continuing the tradition of sharing my \noutlook for the economy here at the Central Exchange , something I first did in January 2012 \nshortly after I became president of the Kansas City Fed.  It was a time of recovery in the U.S. \neconomy after a terrible financial crisis and Federal Reserve policymakers were deliberating on how and when to unwind an extraordinary monetary policy response .  \nA decade later, the U.S. economy again finds itself recovering from a n unprecedented \nshock with Federal Reserve policymakers contemplating how and when to unwind an \nunprecedented monetary policy response . To be clear, the challenges we face today are quite \ndifferent in many respects even as the uncertainty that accompanies policymaking choices has \nfamiliar refrains.  \nLooking back, 2021 saw several  notable economic developments , including the largest \nincrease in employment on record as well as the most significant pick -up in inflation in decades . \nThe effects of a global pandemic and the extraordinary policy response that followed, both fiscal and monetary, drove those outcomes  and will likely continue to set the course for the economy \nthis year .  \n\n2 \n In my remarks this morning, I’ll talk about three key dimensions  that will influence \neconomic activity in the coming year : the outlook for demand, the outlook for supply, and the \noutlook for  monetary policy.   \n \nThe Outlook for Demand   \nThe outlook for demand is a positive one.  Spending was robust  going into the holiday \nseason , with November retail sales edging up following a large jump in October.  Recent \nindicators point to continued strong demand even as the sharp rise in Covid cases linked to the \nOmicron variant threatens to muddle the picture  somewhat . With newly reported ca ses now at \nall-time highs, many forecasters are revising down the ir projections  for the beginning of the year, \nthough there is a generally  held view that economic activity, and spending  in particular , has \nbecome more resilient to spikes in the virus.  \nMy own expectation is that the strength of the underlying fundamentals will continue to \nsupport solid consumption growth.  Notably, household income  continue s to increase rapidly.  \nNominal labor compensation has grown roughly 10 percent over the past year amid increases in \nemployment  and wages.  With a record 6.5 million people added to payrolls last year, m ore \npeople working means more income and more spending in the economy.  This is p articularly true \nfor the wage gains going to lower -income workers, a group tha t has traditionally spent a \nrelatively large share of their paychecks.  \nDemand growth is also likely to be supported by health ier household balance sheets.  \nSignificant f iscal transfers, along with  subdued spending early in the pandemic, allowed  many  to \naccumulate saving s and pay down debt.  Households now have over $2 trillion in additional \nsaving s relative to pre -pandemic trends , and buoyant asset markets, with both equity and house \n\n3 \n prices near record highs , have also boosted wealth.  While it is possible  that households could \ndecide to maintain a higher level of saving and liquidity following the volatility of the pandemic, \nmany have the capacity to spend.  \nAnother factor supporting demand growth is a robust outlook for s tate and local \ngovernment spending . With sizeable transfers from the federal government, state budget  \nbalances reached record highs in fiscal year 2021.  And while fiscal policy at the federal level is \nlikely to turn contractionary as spending and transfers fall back from elevated pandemic levels, \nstate and local spending is expected to expand close to 10 percent in the current fiscal year, the \nlargest increase in 15 years.   \nAlthough I expect overall spending to hold up, the surge in the virus is likely to  further \ndelay a normalization of the skewed pattern of consumption we have observed over the past two \nyears . Throughout  the pandemic,  consumers have favored the purchase of goods, particularly \ndurable goods . For example, additional time at home launched a wave of residential remodeling \nand upgrading with demand for furniture and appliances . It also inspired purchases  of home \nexercise equipment and bicycle sales.  Although durable goods consumption has fallen from its \npeak, the level remains 10 percent higher than its pre-pandemic trend, and there are indicators it \nmight be even higher if supply constraints weren’t limiting purchases . This is particularly true \nfor automobiles, where depleted inventories are likely weighing on sales.   \nIn contrast to goods, spending on services remains considerably below trend, as \nconsumers continue to avoid in-person recreation, including live performances and movies, and \nhave cut back on visits to doctors and dentists.  The same is true with bu siness travel still \ndisrupted, hotels and air transportation remain depressed (though it might be hard to tell from the middle seat of a n overbooked flight) .  \n\n4 \n  \nThe Outlook for Supply  \nTurning to the outlook for the supply of goods and services , 2021 saw supply lag demand \nfor many categories of consumption, particularly goods . The result was higher prices . With \noverall demand expected to remain strong , a key question for the outlook is whether supply will \nbe able to keep up, particularly as the Omicron variant threatens to delay a rotation of \nconsumption from an overheated goods sector to a relatively slack service s sector . Whether or \nnot supply is able  rise to the occasion in part will be determined by the persistence of pandemic -\nrelated disruptions that have weighed on both product and labor markets.   \nOne set of factors constraining supply relates to product ion bottlenecks and shortages, \nmany originati ng in the rapid closing and subsequent slow reopening of the economy during the \npandemic.  The range of disruptions across factories and across countries has jumbled global \nsupply networks, as ha ve disruptions to transportation networks , including the carefully \nchoreographed movement of shipping containers around the world temporarily collaps ing in \ndisarray.  Slowly, these disruptions are being dealt with , and there are indications that the wors t \nhas passed  as shipping rates have peaked  and port backlogs are being cleared.  Reports of supplier \ndelivery delays declined in December  even as they remain at historically elevated level s.      \nA lack of l abor also has been an  important constraint on supply.  Speaking to contacts in \nmy region, I hear consistent reports of labor shortages.  These reports align with  the data , \nreflecting the ratio of job openings per unemployed person near  all-time high s and workers \nquitting jobs at a record pace.  The labor market looks tight, with the unemployment rate f alling \nto 3.9 percent in December  and wage growth picking up solidly.  The strength of the labor market \n\n5 \n is even more apparent within some parts of our region, with the unemployment rate in Nebraska \ndropping to 1.8 percent, a record low for any state.  \nThis tight labor market  reflects the strength of demand but  also constrain ts on the supply \nof labor . In December, t he labor force participation rate remain ed 1.5 percentage points below its \npre-pandemic level and has shown little movement in recent months.  Taking into account the \ntrend decline in labor force participation as the population ages, this amounts to a shortage of \nroughly 3.5 million workers.  Understand ing w hat is keeping these workers out of the labor \nmarket, and how persistent these factors are, will be important for determining how quickly the \neconomy will grow, as well as the split between output growth and higher inflation.   \nSo why have workers left  the labor market?  The pandemic likely remains a key \nconsideration, and one that is likely to fade only slowly . In December , 1.1 million persons \nreported not being in the labor force because of Covid, mostly prime -age workers and \ndisproportionately  women . Through out the pandemic , issues in childcare availability have stood \nout as a key constraint on labor force participation, a concern that is only likely to be prolonged \nby the recent surge in the virus and renewed school closures.  Employment in daycare facilities \nremains 10 percent below pre -pandemic levels, suggesting that capacity still has some way to \nrecover.  However, it is not only children. E mployment in nursing and residential care facilities \nhas declined 12 percent relative to the start of 2 020, suggesting that  there has been a substantial \nshift in  family care responsibilities  towards households during the pandemic.   \nAnother contributor to lower labor force participation has been a large increase in the \nproportion of the  population that repor ts being retired.  While these workers are largely not \nattributing their lack of workforce participation to Covid, I would not underplay the role that the \npandemic  could have in elevating the retirement rate . Looking  at detailed data, it appears much \n\n6 \n of the increase in the reported retired population does not reflect  workers moving from \nemployment to retirement but rather a sharp slowdown in the number of retirees returning to \nwork.  In normal times , there is a regular  flow of retired individuals who move  back into \nemployment, in some cases out of personal interest or in other cases out of necessity.  During the \npandemic it appears as though more retirees are deciding to stay retired, perhaps because of \nconcern over illness or as buoyant equity and housing markets have boosted retirement nest eggs \nand financial security.  If concern over illness is a prime motivating factor, some fraction  of these \nworkers are likely to return as the pandemic fades.  \nOf course,  the pandemic has yet to fade, and the latest Omicron variant has the potential \nto prolong supply disruptions and to delay a further recovery in labor markets.
