        "content": "Inform ing Today’s  Monetary Policy  Choices  \n \n \n \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 18, 2019  \nEnergy and the Economy: Markets in Transition  \nA Joint Conference of the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas  \nDenver, Colorado  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n2 \n I’m pleased to welcome you to the fourth  annual energy conference  hosted by the Federal \nReserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas . Energy is a key sector of  our regional economies . \nTaken together, our two regions account for more than 50 percent of U.S. oil prod uction and an \neven larger share of the headquarters of U.S. exploration and production companies, including \nseveral right here in Denver .  \nThe title and theme of this year’s conference  is “Energy and the Economy: Markets in \nTransition .”  As the title sugge sts, there are several notable transitions that we will consider and \ndiscuss today.  \nWe will look first at the transitions underway as global oil markets calibrate the dynamics \nof rising U.S. production amid signs of slowing global economic growth . The Kan sas City Fed’s \nthird quarter energy survey released last Friday showed that new drilling in our region has \nslowed further and firms anticipate more deterioration in coming months, so we are keeping a \nparticularly watchful eye on the sector at the moment.  \nWe will  also discuss the energy transition occurring in the U.S. power utility sector \ndriven by abundant, inexpensive natural gas and rapid growth in renewable energy generation . \nWithin the Kansas City Federal Reserve District  alone , renewables’ share of e lectric power \ngeneration capacity has grown from less than 10 percent a decade ago to more than 25 percent in \n2019 . At the same time, our region produces more coal  — the primary fuel being replaced in \npower generation  — than any other Federal Reserve District . So understanding more about how \nthis transition is evolving is vital for understanding economic trends across our region.  \nFinally, w e will explore transitions in energy finance, with an eye toward the factors that \nare influencing investment and r isk management within the oil and gas , and the renewable \nenergy industries . Understand ing how transitions in the broader energy sector could affect \n\n3 \n financial institutions both la rge and small across our region  is an important aspect of the Federal \nReserve’ s role as a bank supervisor and regulator.  \nTo help guide us through each of these topics, we have a distinguished set of speakers \nand panelists with considerable expertise and  experience from both the private and public \nsectors . I look forward to their co mments and your participation in discussing these themes.  \n As energy market s experience  transitions , they do so in the context of changing dynamics \nin the broader economy . My remarks today will highlight the challenges that monetary \npolicymakers fac e in reading and understanding these transitions while determin ing the \nappropriate setting for policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price \nstability.  \nBefore I continue, however, I want to note that these are my own views and are not \nintended to represent  the view s of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nTHE U.S. ECONOMIC OU TLOOK  \nLooking across most of our economic measures, the U.S. economy is generally \nperforming well . We are now in the  11th year of the current expansion, and the economy has , by \nmost accounts, achieved full employment and stable prices.  The unemployment rate is currently  \n3.5 percent, which is  the lowest level on record in the past 50 years . And inflation, which \nhistorically h as moved higher as the labor market strengthens, has remained low and stable.  \nWith respect to the overall growth rate of the economy, 2019 has been a transition year . \nAs expected , the pace of economic growth has decelerate d to a level more consistent with the \nlonger -run trend growth rate of the economy following two years of strong growth in 2017 and \n2018 . This transition was expected in part due to the tightness of the labor market . When an \neconomy  approach es its full-employment level, the lack of available workers, particularly skilled \n\n4 \n workers, naturally limits the pace at which business activity can expand . The latest reading from \nthe National Federation of Independent Business es survey confirms this dynamic. The percent of \nsurvey respondents that cited  finding qualified workers as their No. 1  problem hit a 46 -year \nrecord high in July .  \nThe transition from faster growth last year to a more moderate pace in 2019 also is \nrelated to fiscal policy . The economy received a boost to aggregate demand from stimulus in \n2018 in the form of a tax cut to businesses and households in addition to increased government \nspending . This stimulus produce d a transitory boost to growth that was expected to eventually  \nfade in 2019 and 2020.  \nUnder these conditions , we have seen the pace of growth decelerate from a strong annual \nrate near 3 percent toward a pace of growth closer to 2 percent . Looking forward, I expect \ngrowth to slow  a bit further over the medium term as it approaches the economy’ s longer -run \ngrowth rate, which I view  as just under 2 percent.  \nWhile the aggregate economic growth picture has unfolded largely as expected in 2019, \nthere are important developments in play across broad sectors of the economy . A clear \ndichotomy is emerging between the services sector1, which is supported by strong  consumption \ngrowth, and the goods -producing sector, which is facing a range of economic crosscurrents . \nAcross both of these sectors, t he primary driver for economic growth in the U.S. is t he consumer . \nThe strong labor market with high levels of employment and upward pressure on wages has \nprovided the fuel to support solid consumption growth  and contribute to a high  level of consumer \nconfidence . Strong consumer momentum, which is also suppor ted by an overall personal savings \n                                                 \n1 Service -providing industries tied closely to the consumer include education and health services, leisure \nand hospitality, information, finance, and wholesale and retail trade.  \n \n\n5 \n rate that remains at a stable and relatively high level, has been the key underpinning of my \noutlook for continued economic expansion over the medium term.  \nThe goods -producing sector, which includes manufacturing, mining,  energy production \nand construction, has, on the other hand,  faced a range of challenges that has limited its pace of \nexpansion . For example, an expansion of U.S. tariffs on imports, retaliatory tariffs on our exports \nabroad, along with weaker global growth and continued uncertainty surrounding trade policy \nhave  created stiff headwind s for manufacturers . Our manufacturing survey for the region shows \nthat activity has contracted in  each of the past three months , and the national ISM survey  \nindicates that manufacturing activity for the nation also moved into contractionary territory in \nAugust . For the energy sector, oil prices are down about 20 percent from a year ago, contributing \nto a slowing in drilling activity across most oil -producing regions in the country.   And in the \nhousing sector, although  forward -looking indicators have improved recently , rising mortgage \nrates in 2018 and the first half of 2019 coupled with rising housing prices contributed to a \ndecline in home sales and six conse cutive quarters of declining residential investment .  \n So on balance, while the broad economy continues to grow with high levels of \nemployment and low inflation, downside risks are prominent and have strained key parts of the \ngoods -producing sector . This d ichotomy presents a challenge for policymakers as they determine \nthe appropriate stance for monetary policy  under such conditions . \n \nDATA DEPENDENCE VERS US RISK MANAGEMENT  \nAs policymakers confront this challenge, policy choices can become more difficult . \nEasing policy may be viewed as a proactive step to ward off weakness in a particular sector in \nthe attempt to prevent th at weakness from spreading to broader parts of the economy . Another \n\n6 \n approach would be to closely monitor the sectoral weakness, but wait until signs emerge of a \nbroader slowdown in activity before taking action . To better illustrate this challenge , I’ll talk \nabout these  different approaches to policy setting  using two frequently cited descriptions : a data-\ndependen t approach  and a risk-manag ement  approach . I’ll argue that both elements are important \nto monetary policy decisions.  \nFederal Reserve policymakers began using the phrase “data dependent” in 2012 to \ndescribe their approach to policy making . The phrase was intended to convey that polic ymakers \ncould not credibly commit to specific actions at specific dates in the future, but instead, their \nview of the appropriate setting of interest rates would evolve based on new data received . Such \nan approach could be misread as suggesting a “data -dependent” policymaker is solely influenced \nby the most recent data release , basing his or her decision on the arrival of new data  rather than a \nmodal outlook for the economy .  \n“Data-dependent” policy decisions in my view actually encompass a much broader  and \nmulti -faceted  process in which the da ta represent just one element . The foundation for the  \ndecision -making process is  a collection of information  that includes not only incoming data, but \nalso the perspectives from my District contacts . Their anecdote s provide timely information that \nis not likely to  appear in the data for several weeks or months given the inherent delays in \nreporting and revision of data statistics .  \nWith  this information in hand, judg ments are required to determine how t his broad \ninformation updates the  economic outlook for the near and medium term . Given the long and \nvariable lags in the time it takes for monetary policy decisions to transmit to the broader \neconomy, one’s outlook  for key variables such as real GDP growth, the unempl oyment rate, and \ninflation are central to determin ing the appropriate policy action for today . So when I refer to a \n\n7 \n “data -dependent” approach for policymaking, it is this broader approach  that I have in mind  \nrather than a short -term reaction to the most re cent data point . \nA second commonly cited approach to policymaking is “risk management .”  This \napproach is not  necessarily distinct from a “data -dependent” approach . Rather than focusing on \none’s view of the data and the mostly likely, or moda l, view for the outlook, a risk -management \napproach seeks to assess the range of risks  and then determine the policy action that best  \npositions the economy to weather those risks.  \nIn the current context, while one’s modal outlook for the economy may be consistent \nwith the FOMC’s dual mandate, downside risks may represent alternative scenarios with \nundesirable outcomes for econom ic growth and stability . One such current risk is associate d with \nthe ongoing trade policy uncertainty . Key questions relevant for policymaker s as they assess this \nrisk would include: How have developments in trade policy impacted the economy since the start \nof 2018 ? How will trade policy decisions going forward influence the outlook? What role is \ntrade policy uncertainty having on the decisions  of businesses and cons umers? Is monetary \npolicy an effective tool to mitigate risks that may emanate from trade policy uncertainty?  \nAssessment of the range of risks facing the economy, which expand far beyond trade \npolicy uncertainty, along with judg ments  of the possible economic implications should any of \nthose risks transpire, may justify policy action as insurance . In such a circumstance, it may be the \ncase that the overall  economy is growing at an above -trend rate and the modal outlook is in line \nwith our dual mandate objectives . But the emergenc e of downside risks  could be viewed as \nsufficiently threatening to warrant an adjustment in policy while those risks persist.  \nA recent example of  this type of situation occurred  in 2014 and 2015 when the economy  \nfaced several shocks that impacted a few industries at a time while  the overall economy was \n\n8 \n expanding at a solid pace . During this period, the price of oil fell by more than  50 percent, the \ndollar appreciated by  approximately 20  percent, and agricultural commodity prices such as corn \nand soybeans fell by more than  25 percent . These shifts in prices contributed to a downturn in the \nenergy, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors  and represented downside risks for the broader \necono my. \nIn this instance , the FOMC did not choose  to directly provide additional accommodation \nto the economy, but instead communicated a shift in its view of the appropriate path for policy \ngoing forward . Using the median of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Pro jections (SEP) as a \nreference point, the projection for the appropriate setting of policy at the end of 2016 was \nlowered by nearly a full percentage point from the March 2014 projection to the December 2015 \nprojection . This adjustment provided appropriate support for the broader economy at a time \nwhen some sectors were experiencing weaknes s. And as the impact of those shocks dissipated \nover time, the FOMC  then implemented the projected policy adjustments that had been delayed . \nDuring this period, the broade r economy continued to expand with real GDP growth remaining \nabove trend and average emp loyment growth in excess of 200,000 new jobs per month.  \nOne c hallenge with this type of risk -management approach to policy setting is that while \nthe benefits of taking out insurance may be clear, the costs are not. One potential cost is that such \nan insurance policy risks overheating the sectors of the economy that are already performing \nwell. This can lead to a misallocation of resources toward those  interest rate -sensi tive sectors at \nthe expense of sectors that may be better positioned for  growth over the longer  run. A second \npotential cost stems from the fact that an easing in monetary polic y is designed to encourage \nrisk-taking and leverage . In the earlier periods of an economic expansion, risks associated with \nincreasing leverage may be moderate, and as such the cost of extra insurance may be low . But \n\n9 \n these costs move higher as the economic expansion matures and as levels of corporate debt and \nother vulnerabilities be come elevated.  \n \nMONETARY POLICY  \nTurning to the current monetary policy settings , data dependence and risk management \ncontinue to provide important strategy foundations for policymakers . In 2018, as the economic \nexpansion continued and the unemployment rate  moved b elow most estimates of its long -run \nlevel, the FOMC continued to gradually remove accommodation and the federal funds rate \nmoved cl oser to estimates of its longer -run level . At the start of 2019 with an outlook for \neconomic growth to decelerate tow ard its longer -run trend growth rate, downside risks had \nemerged and the Committee announced that it would be patient as it determined what future \nadjustments would be appropriate . Then at its July and September meetings, the Committee \ntwice lowered the fe deral funds rates, citing implications of global developments for the \neconomic  outlook as well as muted inflation pressures .  \nI dissented from the recent de cisions to ease policy based on my view of the outlook as it \nrelates to the Committee’s objectives f or price stability and maximum employment . From a data -\ndependence perspective, the moderation of economic growth in 2019 has been for the most part \nin line with my outlook , in which I expect growth  to gradually decline toward it s longer -run \ntrend level over the medium term . The combination of record -low unemployment, moderate \ngrowth, and low and stable inflation with an unchanged outlook led me to conclude that an \nunchanged setting for the federal funds target range  remained appropriate.  \nSupporting  an un changed policy rate in recent meetings does not ignore the downside \nrisks facing our economy . The emergence of those key risks to the outlook as early as the fourth \n\n10 \n quarter of 2018 caused me to moderate my expectation that further rate increases were neede d. \nSimilar to the experience from the 2014 -15 period that I described earlier, I shifted downward \nmy view of the appropriate path for policy over the next one to two  years  in light of the \ndownside risks that have emerged over the past year and the implicat ions of those risks for \ncertain sectors  of the economy . I view this as an appropriate adjustment that is consistent with \nboth data -dependent and risk -management strategies.  \nWhile some may view the cost of a reduction in rates as benign given that inflation  \nremains some what below our 2 percent longer -run target, I am mindful that rate reductions are \nintended to boost demand and encourage risk -taking and leverage . The ability of the Federal \nReserve to offset any unintended effects related to financial stabili ty at this stage of the business \ncycle seem s limited . In the most recent Financial Stability Report issued by the Federal Reserve \nBoard in May, assessments for overall vulnerabilities were mostly sanguine . But the report also \nnoted that “elevated business debt, easy lending standards, and strong risk appetite pose a \nvulnerability… that potentially increases the downside risk to broader economic activity.”  As \ncorporate debt continues to rise to high levels with the fastest growth among the riskiest firms, \nthe largest banks also are lowering their loss-absorbing capital levels . I view this combination of \nrisks as potentially costly to employment and growth, especially at this stage of the expansion .  \nLooking forward, I will remain attentive to the incoming data for signs that downside \nrisks to the outlook materialize in a way that meaningfully affects broad economic conditions . \nUnder those circumstances, I would be prepared to adjust monetary policy accordingly.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n\n11 \n Consumers continue to drive  momentum for economic expansion  in the face of downside \nrisks that over the past year  have slowed activity in several key  sectors . In these circumstances, \nboth data -dependent and risk -management strategies  guide policymakers as they consider \nmonetary poli cy settings . My own outlook for the economy does not call for a mo netary policy \nresponse. While weakness in manufacturing and business investment  is evident , it is not clear \nthat monetary policy is the appropriate tool to offset the risks faced by business es in those sectors  \nwhen weighted against the costs that could be associated with such action . Should downside \nrisks spill over into the broader economy in a way that fundamentally affects the consumer and \nshifts the overall outlook, a monetary policy  response may be required ."

        "content": "Building for the Future : A Public Policy Perspective  \n \n \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 15, 2019  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago Payments Symposium  \nChicago, Ill.  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n1 \n I appreciate the o pportunity to join you today  and want to thank Ellen Bromagen  and the \nChicago Fed team for organizing this important conference . I look forward to the insights that \nwill come from this year’s program and its participants.   \nToday’s theme of innovation recognizes that the changing payments landscape is both \nimportant and exciting, as well as unsettling and disruptive . While a  real-time payment \ninfrastructure for retail payments is the nation’s most significant modernization in more than 40 \nyears , other innovations such as digital currencies enabled by technological adv ancements \ncontinue to emerge . Determining what role they might play in safely and effectively serving the \nbroader payments needs of U.S . households and businesses will require careful public policy \nresearch and analysis .  \nIn the case of faster payments, t he Federal Reserve’s recent decision to build and operate \na real -time payment system also followed years of research and analysis, including broad public \nengagement . Beyond their popularity for speed and convenience, faster payments demonstrate \nvalue in yield ing real economic benefits . In particular, individuals and businesses could realize \nmore flexibility to manage their money and to make time -sensitive payments whenever needed . \nThese advantages could result in better cash flow management and efficienci es for small \nbusinesses , and enable some individuals to avoid high -cost borrowing and penalties such as \noverdraft or late fees .  \nGiven these potential economic benefits, the Federal Reserve determined that upgrades to \nthe payments capabilities of both the Federal Reserve and the private sector were important . To \nfacilitate private -sector advancements, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  approved in \n2017 access to accounts that would allow settlement between and among banks participating in \nprivate -sector payment systems . At the same time, the Fed eral Reserve  began to assess the F aster \n\n2 \n Payments Task Force’s recommendation, asking it to evaluate what role the Reserve Banks \nmight  play in providing real -time settlement services . This year, the Board announced its \ndecision to operate a real -time payment service alongside the private sector . It also announced \nthat further efforts to support private sector services through exploring expansion of hours for the \nFedwire Funds Service and the National Settle ment Service would follow .  \nRecognizing that time to market is important, the Federal Reserve has committed to \nlaunching this new service, known as FedNow, as soon as possible. Work is underway now to \nengage with industry participants on the initial design  and features of the service .   \nAs financial institutions prepare to connect to this critical infrastructure, some are raising \nquestions about the strategic choices they face . I’d like to address three such questions in my \nremarks today . First, will the pr ivate and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems \nwork togethe r seamlessly and ubiquitously? Second, will the pricing scheme be the same for all \nbanks regardless of their size? Third, how soon will the FedNow Service be operational? Before \naddressing each of those questions, I first want to briefly discuss the Fed eral Reserve ’s history as \na payments provider as context .  \n \nFROM THE BEGINNING  \nAlthough real -time payments represent s a significant evolution in our payments system, it \nis not the first time our payments system has been through a significant transition . History shows \nthat the central bank has worked effectively with the private sector and that the nature of this \npartnership has benefitted the system, its participants and the public.  \nThe Panic of 1907 was a catalyst in the creation of the Federal Reserve . One of the \nhallmarks of th e 1907 financial crisis was a nationwide currency shortage that left businesses \n\n3 \n unable to pay workers and settle accounts . Absent a central bank, a few larg e private institutions \nheld tremendous influence  over the financial system . When these institutions  were either \nunwilling or unable to provide necessary liquidity, local bankers w ould band together and issue \nspecial certificates that effectively functioned  as a privately -issued currency . Creating a central \nbank was intended in part to address what had been referred to as a “famine of currency,” during \nthis crisis . This new central bank, according to Ca rter Glass, one of its congressional founders , \nneeded to  “tear down these tollgates u pon the highways of commerce.”  \nEarly on , the Fed developed a  nationwide par clearance system for checks that ensured \nthat a recipient of a payment received the full value regardless of location . In the 1950s, when \nrising check  volumes and a lack of standardization even in the physical dimensions of checks  \nwere proving problematic to banks, the Fed and the American Bankers Association in \npartnership developed the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) system.  \nIn the 1970s, the Fed and private sector developed the automated clearinghouse network \n(ACH) to improve efficiency in the handling of many routine and recurring payments, thus \neliminating the need and cost associated with processing paper checks in these instances.  \nDuring the 1990s, the Fed recognized that the internet’s growing role in our economy \nwould prompt a similar evolution in payments, which then were still largely made by check . A \nnational commission headed by Alice Rivlin, vice c hair of the Fed’s Board of Gover nors at the \ntime, explored the future of the Fed’s role in retail payment services . Through a public feedback \nprocess, the commission reached two conclusions . First, the Federal Reserve Banks should \ncontinue to serve as an operator for retail payments . Second, the Fed should work collaboratively \n\n4 \n with the banking industry to improve efficiency and develop strategies for the movement toward \na digital payments environment.1 \nIn the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when some banks sought to limit customer \nwithdrawal s, the Fed assured the public it was open and ready to meet liquidity needs while \nfinding alternative ground transportation  for check transfers . Importantly, the Fed pledged to \nimmediately credit to banks all checks it processed . This promise to honor “flo at” provided a key \nsource of liquidity.  \nIn the months after the 9/11 attacks, the Fed played a key role in promoting greater use of \nelectronic check processing  to eliminate  significant inefficiencies in the payments system . \nCongress ultimately passed legislation, known as Check 21, to support the nationwide \nachievement of this improvement to our payment system .   \nThis historical record shows that having the Federal Reserve as an operator within the \npayments system has yielded public benefits . This reco rd also suggests that participation in real -\ntime settlement services will raise performance and accountability for the FedNow Service and \nothers.  \n \nTHE ROAD TO FEDNOW  \nFrom the Rivlin Commission to the efficiencies gained through Check 21, the Fed eral \nReserve , working with the industry , had already taken the first steps on the road that would lead \nto today’s faster payments supported by real -time settlement infrastructure . Over the past six \nyears , there ha ve been a number of collaborative initiatives between the Federal Reserve and \nindustry stakeholders on strategies for improving the payment system .  \n                                                           \n1 “The Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism.” Federal Reserve System. January \n1998. https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/general/1998/19980105/19980105.pdf  \n\n5 \n Among these, in  2015, the Federal Reserve convened the Faster Payments Task Force, a \n320-member group comprised of a broad range of industry participants . Its conclusions – that the \nFederal Reserve  should develop a 24x7x365 settlement ser vice to support faster payments  and \nexplore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operati onal role(s) in faster payments – \naligned with both the outcomes of the Rivlin Commission and the Fed’s longstanding role in \npayments . The United States Treasury shared that view, recommending last year that “the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the \ndevelopment of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and \nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”2 \nThroughout its history, access to Fed payment services, such as check, ACH, and funds \ntransfer services, has facilitated the banking system’s ability to deliver its services with \nnationwide reach . In addition, these services have traditionally operated alongside private -sector \nservices , achieving broad public benefits . Giving the industry choices in payments services, t his \ncompe tition has spurred lower costs, increased efficiencies and better service for users, as noted \nby independent reviews including the Government Accountability Office in 2016 .3 \n \nQUESTIONS  \nWith this historic al context , I’ll turn to each of the three questions I noted earlier : 1) will \nthe private and public options be interoperable to ensure the systems work together seamlessly \n                                                           \n2 U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System That Creates Econo mic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and  \nInnovation,” (July 2018) at 156. Available at  https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018 -08/A -Financial -System -that-\nCreates -Economic -Opportunities ---Nonbank -Financials -Fintech -and-Innovation.pdf  \n3 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase  \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.” U.S. Government Accountability Office. August 30, 2016.  \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO -16-614. https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/679388. pdf \n\n6 \n and ubiquitously? 2) Will the pricing scheme be the same for all banks regardless of their size? \n3) How soon will FedNow be operational?  \nThe importance of interoperability was prominent in the desired attributes of a faster \npayment system based on the Faster Payments Task Force’s  work . In a market structure with \nmultiple operators of real -time gross settlement services for faster payments,  the ability to secure \nnationwide access is advanced when customers of a bank participating in one service are able to \nreach the customers of a bank participating in another service . Similar to the efficiencies gained \nthrough the development of a consistent MICR system with checks in the 1950s, and the \nnationwide reach achieved with existing payment services, common standards and rules for \nseamless processing of real-time payment messages  is a desirable feature . But it is one the \nFederal Reserve recognizes may be difficult to achieve, at least early on .  \nAcross the existing payments landscape, services with multiple operators have been able \nto achieve the goal of nationwide reach . Although the approaches differ, they have functioned  \neffectively.  \nOne approach allows the direct exchange of payments between operators, where \npayments originated by a participant of one service could be received by a participant of another \nservice . This situation exists today in the case of the ACH system . The direct exchange of \nmessages between operators would require technical functionality to move the messages and a \nmethod to enable settlement across systems and participants . The level of cooperation between \noperators and complexity increases significan tly with this approach . I don’t consider it an \ninsurmountable challenge, but it could take time to achieve , and thus, it may not be an initial \nelement of the FedNow Service.  \n\n7 \n Another approach to achieving nationwide reach is for financial institutions to participate \nin multiple services that are not interoperable, but where at least one service has achieved \nnationwide reach on its own . Such an approach is used today in the funds transfer system . A \nfinancial institution that participates in multiple services can choose which service to use for \ntransactions, depending on any number of factors, such as fees, functionality, and counterparties \na particular service can reach.  \nAs we engage with the industry, we are exploring these approaches and other potential \npaths to achieving the ultimate goal of nationwide reach for faster payments . We also recognize \nthat the initial approach may change over time as technology, industry practices, and the \nrelationship between real-time gross settlement  services for faster payments evolve . To be sure, \nthe Federal Reserve is committed to exploring with the industry interoperability and other paths \nto achieving ubiquity.  \nA second question that has surfaced relates to how the FedNow service will be priced . As \nnoted in the Federal Register Notice, the Board of Governors will announce the FedNow fee \nstructure and fee schedule before the service is launched . This transparency in pricing will take \ninto account prevailing market practices and can be expected to i nclude a combination of per -\nitem fees, charged to sending and potentially to receiving banks, and fixed participation fees .  \nAs with existing services, the FedNow Service will be subject to the Monetary Control \nAct which requires that aggregate revenues ma tch costs over the long run and requires the Board \nof Governors to adopt pricing principles specifically to avoid unfair competition with the private \nsector . The Federal Reserve follows a transparent process in describing its schedule of fees for \neach serv ice line in an annual notice to the public.  \n \n\n8 \n Because the current private sector service initially  proposed flat -fee pricing , questions \nhave been raised about whether th e Fed will offer the same pricing or a volume -based pricing \nstructure. Implic it in this qu estion is whether one approach is fairer than the other . \nPricing based on volume or bulk is common in many industries . In the context of \npayment services, there are  often large fixed costs . When a service has more volume, it is able to \noffer the service at a lower pric e because the costs are spread out over more transactions . Unlike \nservices provided to a small group of participants with high transaction volumes, Federal \nReserve services are provided to a diverse group of participants that vary in terms of size and \ntransaction volume.  \nIn such circumstances , volume -based pricing helps ensure sufficient use of the service to \nspread costs over greater volumes, yielding lower prices for all participants . Because of these \nbenefits , volume -based pricing has been considered an acceptable pricing strategy, as noted  in \nthe 2016 GAO review . That said , a pricing structure for the FedNow Service has not yet been \ndetermined.  \nFinally, w e have received a number of questions about th e timing and a desire to see the \nnew service delivered quickly . Recognizing that time to market is an important consideration for \nmany industry participants , the Federal Reserve has committed to launching the new FedNow \nService as soon as we can . Efforts are now underway to gather input from industry participants \non the initial design and features of the service . As these  details are finalized, the Board of \nGovernors  will publish a final service description .  \nWhile the initial availability of the FedNow Service is a top priority for the Federal \nReserve , the achievement of true nationwide reach  remains a critical measure of success for \nfaster payments  for any service, including the FedNow Service or a private -sector service . \n\n9 \n Connecting more than 10,000 financial institutions to a faster payment service w ill take some \ntime. For example, by the middle of 2019, banks that had joined the private -sector service \nrepresented less than 1 percent of all U.S. banking institutions .  \nIn addition to moving quickly to deliver the service, we will ensure that industry \nparticipants are prepared to connect to the FedNow Service . Ahead of the service’s availability, \nthe Federal Reserve will be work ing closely with banks and their technology partners to prepare \nfor expeditious onboarding.  \nBeyond the questions related to inte roperability, pricing and time to market, the safety of \nthe payment system is crucial to the nation’s economic growth and financial stability . The \nFederal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the safety of the U.S. \npayment system by providing liquidity and operation al continuity in times of crisis . As \nprominence of faster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow \nService will allow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support t he \nbanking  system and the broader economy .  \nAs operator of the FedNow Service, the Federal Reserve also will be in a position to \npromote the development and implementation of industry -wide standards, as has been the case in \nother payments systems where the  Fed plays an operational role . Given the irrevocable, real -time \nnature of faster payments, the ability to detect and prevent fraud will be a key aspect of ensuring \nsafety of the system.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nInnovation brings important benefits to our economy . We are seeing faster payments \nservices grow in popularity . An efficient payment system facilitates and encourages economic \n\n10 \n activity by making it faster, cheaper, and more convenient for individuals and businesses to pay \nfor goods and services . Creating real -time settlement services in the U.S. lays a foundation on \nwhich both banks across the country and the broader payment industry can build modern, \ninnovative, and safe faster payment services.  \nThe Federal Reserve has been core to that system for more than a century . In response to \ntoday’s need for real -time settlement services, we are moving quickly to deliver the FedNow \nService . Decisions about interoperability  and pricing  across multiple providers are yet to come, \nbut the Federal Reserve’s h istory points to  a strong public policy focus on objectives for access, \nequity and safety  that will guide the answer to these questions . Importantly, t he FedNow S ervice \nwill support the innovative  solutions available to consumers and businesses today, and many \nmore I anti cipate are yet to be thought of, although they may only be just around the corner."

        "content": "Price Stability: A Main Street Perspective  \nRemarks by  \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 6, 2019  \nNational Ass ociation for Business Economics  Annual Meeting  \nDenver, Colorado  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n \n1 \n Thank you and welco me to Denver  — one of three branch cities in the Tenth Federal \nReserve District , headquartered  in Kansas City . Our Denver Branch  serves Colorado, Wyoming, \nand northern New Mexico  and provides valuable insight into local and regional economic \nconditions thr ough contacts and relationships fostered by our Branch staff and Board of \nDirectors . The Federal Reserve’s founders knew that the long -term success and credibility of the \ninstitution would rely on its ability to serve the diverse interests, geographies, an d industries that \nmake up the U.S. economy. By maintaining close regional relationships throughout our District, \nincluding Colorado, we are able to ensure that a regional perspective can be  represented at policy \nmeetings in Washington , D.C.  \nIn addition  to providing regional economic insights , the B ranch  engages in the \nsupervision and regulation of financial institutions, provides cash services to these institutions, \nand promotes financial education and community development through a variety of programs . \nOur Denver Branch is located just a few blocks from this location, and we hope that you’ll join \nus for a reception at the Branch tomorrow evening.  \nThis afternoon I would like to focus my remarks on how I view the Federal Reserve’s  \ninflation objective in relation to its dual mandate for price stability and maximum employment .1 \nAs I hear from many academics, financial market participants, and central bankers, there appears \nto be considerable angst over the fact that inflation has fallen persistently below t he Fed’s \ninflation objective of 2 percent . It has given rise to increased interest in alternative monetary \npolicy strategies that might better  anchor inflation at 2 percent and is one reason why the Federal \nReserve has embarked on a n unprecedented public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, \nand communications .  \n                                                 \n1 I would like to thank Kansas City Vice President and Economist George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these \nremarks.  \n\n \n \n2 \n Viewed from the perspective of Main Street , however, stakeholders show little concern \nabout  inflation run ning below the Fed’s target . They see t he U.S. economy is currently in a good \nplace . The unemployment rate is near a 50 -year low, inflation is low and stable, and the economy \nis growing near potential . In the midst of the longest business cycle expansion in history , \ninflation running a few tenths of a percent below 2 percent is , in itself, not a compelling \njustification for providing additional monetary policy accommodation.  \nIn my comments today, I will focus on three issues related to inflation dynamics, \nparticularly as they relate to the Fed’s  price stability mandate . First, wha t explains low i nflation \nin the United States? Second, is low inflation currently a problem? And third, to the extent low \ninflation is a problem, how should the Fed respond?  \n \nWhat Explains Low I nflation in the United States?  \nTo begin, let me discuss some of the factors that may be contribut ing to continued low \ninflation in the United States . As the economic expansion enters its 11th year, questions continue \nto linger whether inflation will eventually accelerate in the midst of an ever more mature \nexpansion .2 While the  dynamics of inflation during this expansion have surprised many \nobservers, including myself, my current outlook for inflation remains fairly benign .  \nThroughout much of this year, lower -than-expected readings on inflation, as measured by \nthe p ersonal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, have led 12 -month measures of \ninflation to decline relative to last year . PCE inflation currently stands at 1.4 percent as of August \n2019, down from 2.3 percent in August 2018. Core PCE inflation, which st rips out the volatile \nfood and energy components from the consumption basket, also moved lower over the past year. \n                                                 \n2 The National Bureau of Economic Research dates the start of the recovery in June 2009.  \n\n \n \n3 \n Core PCE inflation declined to 1.8 percent at an annual rate in August 2019 from 2.0 percent in \nAugust 2018 .  \nInflation moved lower over the past year despite the unemployment rate edging below 4 \npercent. This recent behavior of inflation suggests to me that factors other than the domestic \nlabor market may be driving inflation . For example, I see global inflationary trends as an \nimportant facto r keeping inflation pressures muted in the United States.  \nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  adopted  its numerical, longer -run \nobjective of a 2 percent annual change in the PCE price index in 2012 . Since then , this measure \nof U.S. inflation has aver aged about 1.4 percent. However, the United States  is not alone in terms \nof falling  short of its longer -run inflation target. Several other major foreign economies also have \nstruggled  to reach their longer -run inflation objectives, including the euro area and Japan.3 More \nbroadly across the globe, inflation declined throughout the last decade. Among nearly 200  \ncountries in the IMF’s database of international statistics, the share of co untries with inflation \nabove 2 percent has, in recent years, declined to levels last witnessed in the 1960s.4   \nWhile there are certainly some specific challenges shaping inflation in each economy, \nincluding where they stand in their own business cycle, th ese recent patterns suggest some \ncommon forces are likely keeping global inflation trends subdued . First, we’ve witnessed the \nwidespread adoption of inflation targets in advanced and emerging economies. As more central \nbanks pursue policies to keep inflati on low, other countries export less inflation globally . This \nfactor may be at work in the United States recently as import price inflation currently remains \n                                                 \n3 The United Kingdom is one advanced economy  that has recently experienced above target rates of inflation amid a \nrapid and large depreciation of their currency following the Brexit vote.  \n4 The International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics database and Federal Reserve Bank of Kans as \nCity research staff calculations. Of 193 countries  and areas , the share with a 3 -year moving average of inflation \nabove 2 percent declined from 97 percent at the end of 2008 to 51 percent as of the end of 2018 . While the database \ncovers 198 countries  and areas , data on inflation is missing for five of them.  \n\n \n \n4 \n lower than during 2004 -2007  — a  period in which  the unemployment rate also reached its \ncyclical lo w but inflation was running slightly above  2 percent .  \nSecond, changes in commodity price dynamics may have significant consequences for \nglobal inflation. Unlike past decades, the advent of nimble U.S. oil production seems  likely  to \nkeep energy prices in check even amidst oil supply disruptions and shortages . As a result, oil \nprice inflation has been lower in recent years than in the 2004 -2007 period, possibly helping \nexplain why the current low unemployment rate is failing to genera te as much inflation in the \nUnited States  as in past expansions. The global nature of commodity markets suggests that these \ndevelopments are likely to affect inflation outcomes in the United States as well as other \ncountries .  \nAnd third, the e -commerce ind uced disruption to global retail represents a global factor \nwhich may weigh on inflation, although its exact effects are difficult to quantify . Comparing to \nthe 2004 -2007 period, the share of U.S. retail sales accounted for by non -store retailers has \ndoubl ed from around 7 percent to nearly 15 percent. As major retailers compete for global \nmarket share, perhaps at the cost of margins, retail price inflation is likely to remain tame.  \nBeyond these longer -term global trends, the rapidly changing trade environm ent threatens  \nthe rise of global supply chains, and I see the persistent effects from the ongoing trade dispute as \ndisinflationary for the United States. In particular, the uneven effects of the changes in trade \npolicy on our trading partners, coupled with  the safety and security of the U.S. dollar in an era of \nuncertainty, has generally led to a rise in the foreign -exchange value of the dollar against other \ncurrencies. These forces, along with ongoing geopolitical risks, likely further reinforce d the \nstren gth in the U.S. dollar over the past year. As a result, I expect that global disinflationary \ntrends, embodied in low import price inflation, will continue to weigh on U.S. inflation.  \n\n \n \n5 \n In addition to  global factors, domestic factors also are at play . For example, recent \nresearch at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City highlights that, after growing rapidly at \nroughly 7  percent  per year over the 1980 -2004 period, college tuition prices have slowed \nmarkedly, averaging much closer to 2  percent  over the las t few years.5  Other staff analysis \nhighlights that inflation for medical care services, a fairly large and important component of the \npersonal consumption expenditure price index, has also been substantially weaker over the last \ndecade.6  These sector -specific factors, such as changes in state appropriations to higher \neducation or changes to the Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors, are important drivers of \nchanges in the inflation rates for these various components . Given that these idiosyncratic, \nsector-specific factors are unlikely to be directly affected by changes in labor market slack, some \ncomponents of inflation may remain muted even if the overall economy is operating at or near \npotential . Such factors are beyond the reach of monetary policy to  control.  \n \nIs Low Inflation Currently a P roblem?  \nWhile I have suggested a number of reasons why inflation has been low in the United \nStates, should we be concerned that inflation is running persistently a few tenths of a percent \nbelow the F ed’s objective o f 2 percent?  My answer to that question is based partly on my \ninteractions with business and community leaders but, in addition, depends on the broader \neconomic circumstances that coincide with low inflation.  \nAs I listen to business and community leaders  around my region, I hear few complaints \nabout inflation being too low. In fact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that \n                                                 \n5 Brent Bundick and Emily Pollard , “The Rise and Fal l of College Tuition Inflation ,” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City Economic Review, First Quarter, 2019 .  \n6 Presentation by A. Lee Smith at the BLS Data User’s Conference .  \n\n \n \n6 \n inflation is as low as measured in a number of key sectors. This leads me to the observation that \ninflation as experienc ed by households and businesses is fundamentally different from inflation \nas viewed by many financial market participants and economists. Households see the prices of \neveryday goods such as food, energy, rents, and health care rising and don’t understand w hy the \nFed would be concerned that inflation is too low. Their short -run expectations for inflation are \ndriven largely by changes in retail gasoline prices while their longer -run expectations, as \nmeasured by the University of Michigan, have been fairly sta ble. (Expected changes in prices \nduring the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 and 2.6 percent since April 2 016 and are \ncurrently at 2.4 percent.)  \nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power, \nsee their pro fit margins squeezed. For them, the product prices they charge are determined by \nstructural factors such as global competition and technological disruption that don’t necessarily \nrespond to monetary policy, while their costs are driven by tight labor and c ommodity market \nconditions. In the A ugust  survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most \nimportant problem, compared with 2 7 percent who said “qual ity of labor” and 9 percent who said \n“cost of labor.”   I would also point out that in the last NABE outlook survey (June 2019), your \noutlook panelists’  median forecast for core PCE price inflation for each quarter of 2020 was 2.0 \npercent at an annual rate  — right at the Fed’s longer -run objective.   \nPhilip Lowe, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, summed it up well at our \nJackson Hole symposium when he said “…many people in our communities are incredulous that \nwe would be too worried over whether inflation was 1.6  per cent, 2.0  per cent or 2.2  per cent. \nThey ask, ‘haven’t you got something more important to worry about? ’”  \n\n \n \n7 \n Beyond this view of inflation from Main Street, I also keep in mind the Fed’s dual \nmandate . Unlike some central banks, we are t asked not only  with achieving price stability, but in \naddition, we have a mandate to achieve maximum employment . In circumstances where the \nunemployment rate is high and inflation is low, as was the case throughout much of the recovery \nfrom the Great Reces sion, policymakers typically ease policy to bring both variables in line with \ntheir longer -run objective s. Low inflation can be a symptom of economic slack, and \naccommodative policy tends to reduce unemployment and increase inflation . In these \ncircumstance s, the direction of policy is clear and policymaker consensus is relatively easy to \nachieve.  \nIn other circumstances  — such as we have today  — with both unemployment and \ninflation low relative to their longer -run objectives, the policy response is not so cl ear. On one \nhand, e asing policy might lift inflation, but at the cost of further tightening an already hot labor \nmarket  and perhaps fostering financial imbalances . And given the reduced responsiveness of \ninflation to economic slack, it might take a conside rable dose  of monetary accommodation to \nnudge inflation upward . On the other hand, tightening policy might limit the overheating of labor \nmarkets , but at the cost of putting further downward pressure on inflation.   \nIn these circumstances, where the objectives are not complementary, the FOMC ’s \nStatement on Longer -Run Goals  and Monetary Policy Strategies  lays out the framework of a  \n“balanced approach” in promoting them . In particular, we take into account the magnitude  of the \ndeviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are \nprojected to return to mandate -consistent levels .  \nNot surprisingly, under this balanced approach, there may be disagreement about a \nnumber of the factor s that determine appropriate policy . For example, policymakers may \n\n \n \n8 \n disagree about the amount of slack in labor markets or the relative costs of deviations of inflation \nand unemployment from their objectives . From my perspective, the deviation from our infl ation \nobjective is currently small, but given structural changes in inflation dynamics, trying to quickly \nreturn inflation to 2 percent by adjusting interest rates could require aggressive actions that \nwould misallocate resources and create financial imbal ances.  \nMy dissent at the last two FOMC meetings was based in part on balancing our objectives \nfor price stability and maximum employment . I dissented from the Committee’s  decision to \nlower the target range for the federal funds rate in July and September because the moderation of \neconomic growth in 2019 has been  in line with my own outlook that calls for a gradual decline to \na trend level over the medium term. With moderate growth, record low unemployment, and a \nbenign inflation outlook, maintaining an unch anged setting for policy would have been \nappropriate, in my view . There are certainly risks to the outlook as the economy faces trade \npolicy uncertainty and weaker global activity. Should incoming data point to a broadly weake r \neconomy, adjust ing policy may be appropriate to achieve  the Federal Reserve’s mandates for \nmaximum sustainable employment and stable prices.  \nBut in the absence of more evidence that the downside risks may be realized, muted \ninflation alone would not warrant a policy response . Rather  than focus ing too narrowly  on \nachieving a precise point target of 2 percent inflation , I find it more realistic  to accept that there \nwill be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target and, as long as they \ndon’t exceed  a reasonable threshold  — perhaps as big as 50 or even 1 00 basis points  —they \nshould be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions . Keeping our sights set on low \nand stable inflation  is key , with 2 percent as our North Star  and longer -run inflation o bjective.   \n \n\n \n \n9 \n When is Low Inflation a Concern and What Can Be Done About I t? \nSo when should  we be concerned about low inflation  and what can be done about it ?  As \nI’ve suggested, in current circumstances , concern about low inflation  seems unnecessary . While I \ndo not see a case for deliberately eas ing policy to boost inflation , the Fed’s 2 percent inflation \ntarget also should not be viewed as a ceiling . Rather, it seems reasonable to allow  modest \nunexpected shocks to  inflation  — perhaps stemming from import prices  — to demonstrate to the \npublic a commitment to achieving our inflation goal on a symmetric basis.  \nIn contrast, if conditions change so that the goals of policy are no longer in conflict, \npolicymakers should be prepared to adjust policy as necessary . For example, if weaker global \ndemand and trade policy uncertainty were to materially weaken my modal  outlook for growth , \nproviding additional monetary accommodation  may be warranted . Such a response to changing \neconomic conditions would support both the e conomic expansion and help offset further \ndownward pressure on inflation.  \nWere a more -severe downturn to hit the economy , policymakers are keenly aware that \nlittle policy space remains with the federal funds rate currently at 1¾ to 2  percent . The prospect \nof such a situation  makes  the Fed’s reevaluation of its policy strategies and objectives  a timely \nundertaking . The review has several parts, including a series of Fed Listens events around the \ncountry designed to help policymakers better understand the per spectives of people from diverse \nbackgrounds and with varied interests . In fact, we’ll host such an event in Kansas City  this week .  \nA few months ago , the Chicago Fed h eld a conference that brought together a distinguished \ngroup of academics, financial  market experts , and labor leaders  to share their p erspectives on \nhow the Federal Reserve can best achieve its mandate. Finally, the FOMC , supported by staff \nthroughout the Federal Reserve System, is devoting time at  its regular meetings to assess lessons \n\n \n \n10 \n learned in the aftermath of the Great Recession . Whether or not we ultimately make any changes \nto our framework, this review is essential in my view to the credibility of our decision -making, \nour commitment to transparency, and our collective learning abou t the changing landscape . I \nhope the exercise will become a regular feature of the Committee’s policy framework.   \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing , the U.S. economy is currently in a good place with low inflation, low \nunemployment, and an outlook for continued moder ate growth . In these circumstances, I am not \nconcerned that inflation is running a bit below our objective of 2 percent . Persistently muted \ninflation is the result of a confluence of temporary and structural factors that are not particularly \nresponsive to interest rate adjustments . Therefore, a degree of flexibility in how we interpret our \nprice stability mandate  seems appropriate . Should conditions change, however, and we find \nourselves again  at the zero lower bound, a fundamentally different strategy  may be needed . In \nanticipation of that possibility, now is a good time for a thorough review of policy strategies, \ntools, and communications."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 4, 2019  \nEconomic Forum  \nTahlequah, Oklahoma  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers, or representatives.   \n\n \n1 \n  \nI am delighted to join you today.  \nI’d like to spend a few moments talking about the Feder al Reserve’s important \nconnection to Tahlequah . The history and design of our nation’s central bank is often \nmisunderstood, but is as important today as ever. Tahlequah is an especially appropriate location \nto discuss this history becau se events that occur red in this area more than a century ago had a \ndirect and significant impact on the Fed’s design.  \nAs you may know, sometime before  1880 a gentlem an named Robert L. Owen came to \nthe Tahlequah area as a teacher and supervisor of the Cherokee National School System.  The \nhistoric Owen School House, now known as the Park Hill/Owen Community Center, near the \nCherokee Heritage Center that bears his name.  \nAfter leaving the school, Owen  became a lawyer and practiced law not far from here in \nMuskogee where he organiz ed and served as president of the First National Bank for a decade.  In \n1907  he was elected one of Oklahoma’s first United States Senators, making him one of the first \ntwo Native Americans to serve in the Senate . \nHe joined  the Senate at a time of economic turmoil. Only a few weeks earlier,  the nation  \nexperienced  a financial crisis that would become known as the Panic of 1907. Soon  after, \nCongress began  discussions about how to improve the nation’s financial system, launching a \nprocess that would lead to the  Federal Reserve Act of 1913.  \nThere, Owen played a key role, serving as the legislation’s Senate sponsor and chair of \nthe Senate Banking Committee.  \nOwen’s 10 years in Oklahoma banking contributed importantly to his th inking about the \nrole of a central bank  and how it should be design ed. Owen was a banker during a particularly \nvolatile time for our nation’s banks and the U.S. economy. The panic of 1893 l ed to the closing \n\n \n2 \n of 500 banks. Owen later talked about  how he saw the problem s in the banking  sector during this \nperiod  ripple across the eco nomy, affecting property values, business failures and \nunemployment, which reached 25 percent or higher in some areas of the United States.  \nHe later wrote that the panic of 1893  “demonstrated the complete instability of the \nfinancial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly \ndefective banking system.”  \nHe had spent much time considering how to address these issues and, as fate would have \nit, was ideally suited to shape a solution when the opportunity was presented.  \n \nMISSION AREAS  \nBefore I talk about the structure, however,  it might be helpful to explain the full mission \nof the Federal Reserve.  \nAlthough monetary policy is likely the first thing that comes to mind when the Fed is \nmentione d, as the central bank of the United States , the Fed  has other responsibilities that focus \non the stability of our nation’s financial system.  \nWe are a banking supervisor with regulatory responsibilities that entail not only \nexamining depository institutions for financial fitness, but also ensuring that all customers are \noffered financial services on fair and appropriate terms. Here we focus on s uch matters as the \nability of borrowers to access the credit that may be necessary to fund an education, establish a \nbusiness or purchase a home.  \nWe are a bank for banks and also serve as the government’s bank .  This means we not \nonly hold deposits but we  are a provider of important services such as those necessary for the \nsmooth functioning of the payments system. This has included the processing of checks along \n\n \n3 \n with the use of other payment rails to transfer funds between depository institutions. Recentl y, \nyou may have seen some headlines about a new Fed initiative for real -time payments, a system \nwhich will expedite the actual flow of funds to match the speed with which consumers pay for \nthings using  apps on their phones or other online services . This i nitiative, which might be \nthought of as a high-tech plumbing network for the financial system, is the most substantial \ninnovation in payments in at least 40 years.  \nAnd, of course, there is our r ole in conducting the nation’s monetary policy , where we \nopera te under a directive from the U.S. Congress that is widely known as the Fed’s dual \nmandate: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and a maximum level of \nsustainable employment.  \nThe Fed relies on a substantial foundation of research in su pport of these operations. Th e \neconomists  who study a variety of economic issues include for example , our Oklahoma City \nBranch with particular expertise in the nation’s energy economy. Others are experts in banking, \nfinancial markets  and payments.  \n \nTHE FO UNDATION OF TODAY’S FED  \nAs I list these responsibilities, it is clear that there are many instances where the financial \nsystem has evolved in ways  that Owen and the Fed’s other c ongressional founders could not \nhave predicted.  \nFor example, w hen Congress was  debating the Federal Reserve Act, the gold standard \nwas literally the standard for the world’s most important currencies. That began to change \ninternationally during World War I and  changed  later in the United States. Th us monetary policy , \nas it is admini stered by the FOMC today under the delegation of Congres s, is an area that has \nseen significant change. In addition, t echnology has increased the pa ce of commerce around the \n\n \n4 \n globe . Meanwhile, innovation in financial products and services has fostered with it a \ncorresponding expansion of  risks.  \nIn the same way the authors of the Constitution could not plan for every eventuality, the \nframers of the Federal Reserve Act recognized that they were establishing a framework for a \ncentral bank that would have to  evolve if it would be capable of serving t he public interest.  \nIn terms of structure and governance, there were two main ideas  put forward during the \ndeliberations : On one side were those who supported a decentralized structure under the control \nof the pri vate sector; on the other side were those who believed  that the system should be highly \ncentralized under government control.  \nOwen , however,  believed in what might be considered a third option: He  was among \nthose who supported the idea of a balanced syste m where both sides could share in governance . \nWith a background in rural Oklahoma banking, Owen  had understandably strong opinions about \nthe potential risks associated with a central bank operating  under  Wall Street’s direct control. In \na debate on an earl y proposal that did not advance, Owen  voiced his concern about a system that \nwas “concentrated in any one city where a small clique could control ” it.  \nSuch an arrangement could present a couple of key risks. First, a closely aligned group of \nlike-minded l eaders might not have sufficient perspective for gauging risks since they would \nlikely have similar views.  For example, a group dominated by an East Coast perspective might \nnot have an appreciation for the full diversity of our banking system and the econ omy. No one \nhere needs to be told that the banking  needs of a Wall Street firm and a Tahlequah entrepreneur \nare very different.  \nThanks in part to Robert Owen,  we have a central bank structured in a manner that serves \nour nation well . General oversight of the Federal Reserve is through a government -appointed \n\n \n5 \n Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. The 12 regional Reserve Banks, meanwhile, are \nindependent corporations that, along with their affiliated Branch offices, operate under the \nleadership of a local bo ard of directors.   \nCurrently, two Oklahoman s serve on the Board of Directors  of the Kansas City Fed’s \nhead office . Rose Washington, who some may know from her work as CEO of the Tulsa \nEconomic Development Corporation , currently serves as chair , while  Doug Stussi, with Love’s \nTravel Stops in Oklahoma City, is a director. Meanwhile, Susan Chapman Plumb from here in \nTahlequah is one of seven Oklahomans serving on the Board of our Oklahoma City Branch .  \nIn addition to their oversight roles , these directors are especially important to me in my \nrole representing the Tenth Federal Reserve District in FOMC policy deliberations. Along with \nour advisory councils and ot her local contacts, they are a source of information regarding \nemerging developments in banking and t he economy.  As intended by Robert Owen, t hey are the \ncritical link in ensuring that our nation’s central bank is not an isolated institution but one that \nconsiders the broad economic experience of all Americans . \nThis broad representation across the United  States  provides the regional Reserve Banks  \nwith a degree of protection against a risk that was recognized early in U.S. history by Alexander \nHamilton . That is  the risk that politicians could try to wield undue and dangerous influence over \nthe central bank . \nRobert Owen, a school teacher from Tahlequah, might not have imagined that the \ninstitution he shaped more than 100 years ago, would have proven so durable  amid  the economic \nand polit ical challenges it would face. But I think he would be pleased to see th at the Fed, by \ndesign , has a system that provides a forum for civil d iscourse about monetary policy and other \nimportant central bank issues.  And in my view, it continues to serve our nation well."

The FSPC oversees the \nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury  by the 12 \nFederal Reserve Banks.   I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth \nstatement on the role of the Federal Reserve in faster payments and the recently announced \nproposal by the Federal Reserve to support faster payments.  \nOver the past decade , cell phones and other online capabilities have made it more \nconvenient to send and re ceive payments .  Although the se mobile apps appear to provide for an  \nimmediate transaction, the underlying infrastructure is not designed to immediately  move money \nbetween banks , creating  notable delays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt .  \nTo support the demand for real -time payments in the United States and to address this \ngap, l ast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors (Board) announced that the Federal \nReserve Banks would develop a new service called the FedNow  Service .    \nSince its founding more than a century ago, t he Federal Reserve has p rovided payment \nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient \npayment system  for the nation .  Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important \noperational role and preparing to support the moderniz ation  of our nation’s p ayment system with \ncapabilities that allow payments to move quickly  through a safe and efficient foundation , on top \nof which innovation and competition can f lourish .  \nThis decision was made only after three established criteria were met.  \n\n2 \n \nThe first of these criteria is that it is a service that other providers alone cannot be \nexpected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity .  \nOf notable impo rtance  related to this criteri on is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect \nto more tha n 10,000 financial institutions.  Through these connections, the Federal Reserve ’s \nexisting  payment services allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of \ncommunities across the United States  with com petitive, fair and transparent access.  Providing \nthis degree of comprehensive nationwide reach is something that we  believe will present \nsignifican t challenges to other providers in the current market landsc ape.  Coming from a region \nof the country with a significant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the \ncentral United States, I can tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been \nwell received.  \nThe second criteri on is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the \nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments system risk.  \nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of \nthe U.S. payment system by providin g liquidity and operational continuity in response to \nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other crises.  The FedNow Service will \nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking \nsystem , as well as promote the development and implementation of industry -wide fraud -\nmitigation  standards.  Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment \nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.   \nThe final criteri on is that the  Federal Reserve be able to fully recover its cost over the \nlong run.   The U.S. payments infrastructure today includes alternative payment choices and \nproviders.  Today, t he Federal Reserve and The Clearing  House operate competing and \n\n3 \n \ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition.  In all of \nour services, we have been able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost \nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals.  In this regard, \neven as we develop the FedNow  Service , the Federal Reserve will continue to explore ways to \nsupport the market’s existing private -sector real -time payment service including through \nexpanded Fedwire Funds Service and Na tional Settlement Service hours as described in the \nrecent Federal Register notice . \nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the  Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has \nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the  nation’s \npayment system and its customers .1, 2  Last summer , the U.S. Treasury recommended that “ the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system, such as through the \ndevelopment of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more efficient and \nubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3  We are engaging now with stakeholders \nfor their input on features of the FedNow Service through the Federal Register notice issued last \nmonth.   \nFinally , I found it gratifying after the Fed eral Reserve  started the conversation about \nfaster payments in the U .S. and led four years of stakeholder engagement that culminated in the \noverwhelming majority of 400 comments from industry, consumer, and small business \nexpressing  support  for the Fed eral Reserve ’s role as a faster payments provider .   \n                                                           \n1 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office.

I am happy to respond to  your questions.  \n\n \n \nFaster Payments and the U.S. Payment System  \nThe U.S. payment system faces a critical juncture in its evolution.  Services to conduct \nfaster payments, which are available via smart phones apps or on our computers, have begun to \nemerge along with the growth of digital commerce.  Faster payments allow individuals and \nbusinesses to send and receive payments within seconds, any time of day, on any day of the year, \nsuch that the receiver can use the funds almost instantl y.  The round -the-clock, real -time nature \nof faster payments offers convenience that is not available with many traditional ways of making \npayments .  In addition, faster payments can yield real economic benefits for individuals and \nbusinesses by providing them with more flexibility to manage their money and allowing them to \nmake time -sensitive payments whenever needed .   \nYet with many of the faster payment services available today, the underlying \ninfrastructure is not designed to immediately move money between banks, creating notable \ndelays between the initiation of a retail payment and its receipt .  These shortcomings limit the \ndegree to which the potential benefits of faster payment services may be widely enjoyed across \nour economy in a safe manner.  Further expansion of the  interbank infrastructure is needed to  \nserve as the foundation for the development of faster payment services that are safe, efficient, \nand broadly accessible to the American public.    \nLast month, the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors  (Board)  announced that the \nFederal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) would develop a new service called the FedNowSM \nService to support widespread adoption of faster  payments  in the United States .  The FedNow \nService will provid e the necessary infrastructure, alongside similar services provided by the \nprivate sector, t o connect banks across the country , allowing them to offer innovative faster \npayment services to their customers. \n\n- 2 - \n \nSince its founding, the Federal Reserve has played a key operational role in the nation’s \npayment system by providing interbank payment infrastructure that is available to bank s across \nthe country, regardless of size or location.  This critical r ole, given  by Congress, stems from  the \nFederal Reserve’s unique ability, as the nation’s central bank, to provide interbank settlement \nwithout introduc ing liquidity or credit risks.  In today’s  payment infrastructure, whether in check \nprocessing,  automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers , you will see a     \nFederal Reserve service operating in healthy competition with and in support of similar services \nprovided by the private  sector , all for the benefit of the American public .   \nThe importance of this ro le has been recognized  broadly , with an independent review by \nthe U.S. Government Accountability Office concluding that the Federal Reserve’s provision of \npayment services has benefited the U.S.  payment system and its users.1  It is important to point \nout, however, that Congress did not grant plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the \nU.S. payment system to the  Federal Reserve , and the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory \nauthority over the pricing set by a private -sector system or to require a private -sector system to \nextend the service to banks of all sizes.  In some other countries, central banks have been \nassigned the  responsibility for regulating p ayment systems.   In the United States, this is not the \ncase.  Thus , the Federal Reserve has historically helped to promote the accessibility, safety, and \nefficiency of the nation’s payment system  and advance innovations through its operational role \nas provider of payment and settlement services.    \n  \n \n                                                           \n1 See U.S. Gov ernmen t Accountability Off ice, GAO -16-614, “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers \nBenefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase Assurance of Cost Accuracy” (2016) .  Available at \nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/GAO -16-614. \n \n\n- 3 - \n \n Path to Present  \nLeading up to the recent FedNow Service decision  and announcement  in August , the \nFederal Reserve took several actions to facilitate the advancement of faster payments in the \nUnited States.  In 2013, the Federal Reserve began a collaborative initiative with industry \nstakeholders to foster improvements to the nation’s payment system.  As part of th is initiative, \nthe Federal Reserve convened in 2015 the Faster Payments Task Force (FPTF), comprising a \nwide range of industry stakeholders, to identify and evaluate alternative approaches for \nimplementing safe and ubiquitous faster payment capabilities in the Unit ed States.  \nThe FPTF published in 2017 a set of consensus recommendations focused on actions to \nsupport improvements to the nation’s payment system.2  Among the FPTF’s recommendations \nwere req uests for the Federal Reserve (1 ) to develop a 24x7x365 settleme nt service to support \nfaster payments and ( 2) to explore and assess the need for other Federal Reserve operational \nrole(s) in faster payments.  Subsequently, t he U.S. Department of the Treasury recommended \nthat “the Federal Reserve move quickly to facilita te a faster retail payments system, such as \nthrough the development of a real -time settlement service, that would also allow for more \nefficient and ubiquitous access to innovative payment capabilities.”3 \n                                                           \n2 These recommendations were intended to help achieve the FPTF’s vision of ubiquitous faster payment capabilities \nin the United States that would  allow any end user (that is, an individual or business) to safely, efficiently, and \nseamlessly send a faster payment to any other end user, no matter which banks or payment services they use.  See \nFaster Payments Task Force, “Final Report Part Two: A Call to Action,” (July 2017).  Available at \nhttps://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/ wp-content/uploads/faster -payments -task-force -final-report -part-two.pdf .  \n3 The U.S. Department of the Treasury also noted that “[i]n particular, smaller financial institutions, like community \nbanks and credit unions, should also have the ability to access  the most -innovative technologies and payment \nservices. While Treasury believes that a payment system led by the private sector has the potential to be at the \nforefront of innovation and allow for the most advanced payment system in the world, back -end Fed eral Reserve \npayment services must also be appropriately enhanced to enable innovations.” U.S. Treasury, “A Financial System \nThat Creates Economic Opportunity: Nonbank Financials, Fintech, and Innovation,” (July 2018) at 156.  Available \nat https://home.treasury.gov/sites/default/files/2018 -07/A -Financial -System -that-Creates -Economic -Opportunities ---\nNonbank -Financi.pdf . \n\n- 4 - \n \n The Federal Reserve also has directly supported the development of private -sector real-\ntime gross settlement (RTGS) services for faster payments.  The Board approved in 2017 final \nguidelines for evaluating requests for joint accounts at the Reserve Banks intended to facilitate \nsettlement between and among banks participating in private -sector payment systems for faster \npayments.4  The impetus for allowing broader use of joint accounts was to support these private -\nsector arrangements . \n In November 2018, the Board published a Federal  Register notice (2018 Notice) \nrequesting comment on two potential actions  that could be taken  by the Federal Reserve  \nconsistent with the FPTF recommendations : (1) a service for 24x7x365 real -time interban k \nsettlement of faster payments ; and (2 ) a liquidity management tool that would enable transfers \nbetween accounts held at Reserve Banks on a 24x7x365 basis to support services for real -time \ninterbank settlement of faster payments.   \nThe Board explained that a Federal Reserve  RTGS service for fa ster payments, alongside \nprivate -sector RTGS services, would provide the infrastructure needed to achieve ubiquitous, \nsafe, and efficient faster payments in the United States.  Other parties, such as banks, payment \nprocessors, and providers of payment serv ices, could utilize this platform as a basis for \ninnovation to meet the specific needs of the business es and households they serve .  The Board \nfurther explained that a liquidity management tool, in turn, could help alleviate liquidity \nmanagement issues for  banks engaged in RTGS -based faster payments , notably those utilizing \nsettlement services offered by the private sector .  In particular, such a tool would enable \n                                                           \n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “Guidelines for Evaluating Joint Account Requests,” (Issued \n2017).  Available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/p aymentsystems/joint_requests.htm .  In 2016, Federal Reserve \nstaff received a request from a private -sector service provider to open a new joint account for that organization’s \nproposed faster payment system.  The use of a joint account at a Reserve Bank to  support settlement mitigates \ncertain risks by reproducing, as closely as possible, the risk -free nature of settlement in central bank money.  \n\n- 5 - \n \n movement of funds between accounts at the Reserve Banks during hours when traditional \npayment and settlement services are currently not open to allow liquidity to be moved, when \nneeded, to an account or accounts used to support real -time settlement of faster payments.  The \n2018 Notice proposed that the tool could be provided by expanding operating hours of current \nFederal Reserve services or through a new service.  \nIn the 2018 Notice, the Board requested comment on the appropriateness of real -time \ngross settlement as the strategic foundation for faster payments in the United States and the \npublic benefits, implications, and challenges of the Federal Reserve taking ei ther, both, or neither \nof the potential actions.  \nConsideration of Comments and Policy As sessment  \nThe Board received over 400 comment letters  representing over 800 entities  in response  \nto the 2018 Notice.  Comments were submitted by a wide variety of stake holders in the U.S. \npayment system,  including community banks,  individuals, consumer organizations, merchants, \nservice providers, private -sector operators, fintech companies, trade organizations, and other \ninterested parties.5  Consistent with the diversity of the payment industry, commenters \nrepresented a broad range  of viewpoints.  \nAlmost all commenters addressed the question of whether the Federal Reserve  should \ndevelop a  real-time interbank settlement s ervice for faster payme nts.  The vast majority  of these \ncommenters , representing nearly every stakeholder segment, supported the Federal Reserve \n                                                           \n5 Overall, banks were the largest group of respondents, with community banks (small and midsize banks) \ncomprising  approximately 60 percent of the total comments —the largest specific segment —and representing \ninstitutions from 34 states.  \n\n- 6 - \n \n taking this action.   In contrast, large banks, some trade organizations, and private -sector \noperators were generally not supportive of  the Federal Reserve developing such a service.6  \nIn reaching its decision to offer the FedNow Service, the Board was informed by these \npublic comments  and the history of the U.S. payment system , in which the Federal Reserve has \nplayed a role since its inception .  In addition, any decision by the Board to offer a new payment \nservice is subject to the factors set out in longstanding Federal Reserve polic y, and the pricing of \nReserve Bank services is subject to the requirements of the Monetary Control Act of 1980 .7  \nSpecifically, in considering new services, the Board assesses three criteria: whether the service is \none that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide with reasonable effectiveness, \nscope, and equity ; whether the service will yield a clear public benefit ; and whether the     \nFederal Reserve will achieve full cost recovery over the long run .8  \nOther Providers Criterion  \n Through this assessment , the Board has concluded that other providers alone cannot be \nexpected to provide an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments with reasonable effectiveness, \nscope, and equity.  So far, only one private -sector RTGS service for faster payments has been \nestablished in the United States.  Due to coordination challenges and the high f ixed costs \nnecessary to develop a new payment and settlement service, this service is expected to re main \nthe sole private -sector RTGS service for faster payments in the United States.   The ability of a \n                                                           \n6 Approximately half of the commenters discussed the liquidity management tool, with almost all supporting the \nFederal Reserve offeri ng such a tool.    \n7 In 1984, the Board established criteria for the consideration of new or enhanced Federal Reserve payment services \nin its policy The Federal Reserve in the Payment System.  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, “The \nFederal R eserve in the Payments System,” (Issued 1984; revised 1990).  Available at \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/pfs_frpaysys.htm . \n8 In addition, the Board performs a competitive impact analysis when considering an operational or legal change to a \nReserve Bank service or price that would have a direct and material adverse effect on the ability of other providers \nof services to compete w ith the Reserve Banks.   \n\n- 7 - \n \n sole private -sector provider to extend  access to a few  thousand banks, let alone the more than \n10,000 diverse banks necessary to achieve true nationwide scope, would be costly and time -\nconsuming given that the existing service has l imited relationships with and connections to these \ninstitutions.  \nIn addition,  the Board concluded that the private -sector operator alone cannot be \nexpected to provide the service with reasonable effectiveness , as viewed through the lens es of \nsafety and efficiency .  From a safety perspective, a sole provider may serve as a single po int of \nfailure in the market for RTGS -based faster payments .  From an efficiency perspective, a market \nwith only a single operator may cause challenges related to competition, innovation, and market \nfragmentation .  According to established economic theory and experience from other markets, a \nsingle service provider not facing competition can yield undesirable outcomes, such as higher \nprices or lower service quality.  Such undesirable outcomes could limit adoption of faster \npayments by end users, which could in turn curtail efficiency benefits to the broader economy.  \nPublic Benefits Criterion  \n The Board also determined that the FedNow  Service will yield a clear public benefit. \nSince its inception, an underlying public  policy rationale for the Federal Reserve’s involvement \nin the payment system has been to provide services in a safe and efficient manner to banks \nnationwide.  Because of this long -standing policy commitment, the Federal Reserve has \nhistorically extended a ccess to banks of all sizes, including smaller banks in rural and remote \nareas of the country.   The Federal Reserve’s  relationships with and  connections to thousands of \nbanks across the country provide a solid foundation for the FedNow Service to facilitat e those \nbanks gaining access to an RTGS infrastructure for faster payments, which would benefit small \nand midsize banks and the communities they serve.   \n\n- 8 - \n \n In a payment system with multiple operators, banks would have a choice whether to join \na single service  or multiple services.  An RTGS infrastructure could, therefore, achieve \nnationwide reach in two main ways, either through interoperability via direct exchange of \npayments between operators, such as in the U.S. ACH system, or through at least one service \nconnecting to virtually all banks, such as in the funds transfer system.  \nThe FedNow  Service would promote payment system safety in multiple ways.  As noted \nby commenters, the Federal Reserve has historically played an important role in promoting the \nsafety  of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response \nto financial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other crises.  As the prominence of \nfaster payments in the United States grows, the development of the FedNow  Service would allow \nthe Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking system and \nthe broader economy in times of crisis .  In addition, as the operator of the service , the        \nFederal Reserve would be in a position to promote the development and implementation of \nindustry -wide fraud -mitigation standards, which commenters highlighted are especially \nimportant for real -time p ayments .  The development of the service could also enhance the safety \nof the U.S. payment system by promoting resiliency through redundancy.  \nFinally, the FedNow  Service could provide efficiency benefits by serving as a platform \nfor innovation and the dev elopment of end -user services  by the private sector .  In addition, an \nRTGS infrastructure with nationwide reach would make the development of new faster payment \nservices based on real -time settlement more attractive, increasing innovation and competition i n \nthe market for end -user faster payment services.  Such c ompetition could yield efficiency \nbenefits by leading to lower prices and higher service quality.  \n \n\n- 9 - \n \n Cost Recovery Criterion  \nThe Board expects that the FedNow  Service will achieve full recovery of costs over \nthe long run .  The MCA requirement to require cost recovery “over the long run” is not \nassociated with a specific timeframe.  Beginning in 1995, the Board adopted a convention \nof evaluating long -run cost recovery for existing services using a ro lling 10 -year period.  At \nthat time, Federal Reserve  services were in mature states, characterized by widespread \nadoption by banks of all sizes throughout the country, with relatively stable volumes and \ncosts.  At other times, notably as the ACH service wa s evolving, the Board considered long \nrun over an extended time period in order to encourage the adoption of electronic payments \nfor the benefit of the economy.9  \nGiven the time frame necessary to create a broad network of banks  connecting to the \nservice , the Board determined that  a longer time frame for cost recovery is consistent with \nthe intent of the MCA to encourage the adoption of new services that have the potential to \nbring widespread economic benefits to the country.  \nExpanded H ours for Existing S ervices  \nThe second proposed action in the 2018 Notice entailed the exploration of  the expansion \nof operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service , which is our existing funds transfer service, \nand National Settlement Service  (NSS) hours, which is our servic e that supports private -sector \nnet settlement arrangements, potentially up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity management , \nnotably for users  of private -sector RTGS services.  \n                                                           \n9 ACH began as a Federal Reserve service in the 1970s, prior to the passage of the MCA.  In 1981 , when the pricing \nprinciples were first applied to ACH, the Board recognized that the ACH service was still evolving and allowed fees \nto be set based on mature volume costs rather than current costs for a number of years and only at the end of that \ntime began marking 10 -year cost recovery.  The Board concluded that doing so would result in a more efficient \npayment mechanism and was consi stent with the MCA.  See 46 FR 1343 (Jan uary 6, 1981).     \n\n- 10 - \n \n As described in the 2018 Notice, RTGS -based faster payment services require bank s to \nhave sufficient liquidity positioned in a specified account to perform interbank settl ement at any \ntime, on any day.  Without sufficient liquidity so available to conduct settlement, a faster \npayment cannot be completed in an RTGS -based service where,  by design, interbank settlement \noccurs before final funds can be made available to the receiver.  At present, the Federal Reserve \ndoes not provide a service that would provide a means to position additional liquidity in the \nspecified account  outside stand ard business hours .  In light of these considerations, in its 2018 \nNotice the Board proposed developing a liquidity management tool that could help address these \nneeds  by facilitating transfers to and from other accounts held by participants at Federal Res erve \nBanks . \nIn response to the 2018 Notice, several large banks and other commenters indicated that \nthe proposed tool could help with managing liquidity in the recently established private -sector \nRTGS service for faster payments.  The private -sector RTGS s ervice is supported by funds in a \njoint account at a Reserve Bank, and the proposed liquidity management tool would enable \nmovement of funds between a joint account and banks’ reserve accounts during hours when \nexisting services are not currently open.  Commenters suggested that the Federal Reserve should \nprovide this tool through expansion of operating hours for the Fedwire Funds Service.   \nCommenters also noted that expanded Fedwire Funds Service hours, and relatedly, NSS \nhours, could provide benefits f or a variety of payment activities beyond those related to faster \npayments.  Payment activity supported by expanded hours could include additional settlement \nwindows for the ACH service and wholesale payment activity in global markets.  Because of the \nsystemic importance of the Fedwire Funds Service, in particular, additional risk, operational, and \n\n- 11 - \n \n policy analysis is required for this action, and the draft notice indicates the Federal Reserve’s \nintention to engage actively with the industry to conduct this analysis.   \nThe FedNow  Service  \nAs explained in the August announcement, t he FedNow Service would conduct real -time, \npayment -by-payment, settlement of interbank obligations through debits and credits to banks’ \nbalances in accounts at the Reserve Banks.  Real-time settlement in accounts at the Reserve \nBanks means that settlement occurs without liquidity or credit risks, which enhances the safety \nof these payments.  The FedNow S ervice would incorporate clearing functionality, allowing \nbanks, in the process of settling each payment, to exchange information needed to make debits \nand credits to the accounts of their customers.  The service’s functionality would support banks’ \n(or th eir agents’) provision of end -to-end faster payments to their customers.  \nUltimately, the FedNow Service will provide, alongside similar private -sector services, \ncore infrastructure to promote ubiquitous, safe, and efficient faster payments in the United St ates.  \nIn fact, for all payment systems in our country, no single private -sector provider has ever \nachieved nationwide reach on its own .  With the FedNow Service, banks will now have a choice  \nin providers or could choose to use both a Federal Reserve and p rivate -sector service for back -up \npurposes, as some do today for check, ACH, and wire services.  \nThe Federal Reserve  recognize s that time -to-market is an important consideration \nexpressed by many commenters in response to the 2018 Notice.  Our objective is  to implement \nthe service as soon as practicably possible.  However, th e achievement of true nationwide reach \nover the long term, as opposed to initial availability of a service, is the most important measure \nof success for faster payments.  \n\n- 12 - \n \n At the same ti me as the Board published its decision regarding the new service, the Board \nrequest ed public comment on how the FedNow  Service might be designed to most effectively \nsupport the full set of payment system stakeholders and the functioning of the broader U.S. \npayment system.  In the same notice , the Board also announc ed its intention to explore the \nexpansion of Fedwire Funds Service  and NSS hours, up to 24x7x365, to facilitate liquidity \nmanagement in private -sector real -time gross s ettlement services for faster payments and to \nsupport a wide range of payment activities, beyond those related to faster payments.  \nThe Board’s important decision to approve a new payment service  comes over 40 years \nafter the last service, A CH, was approved for implement ation back in the 1970s .  The decision to \nestablish A CH came at a pivotal moment when the industry was overwhelmed by the volume of \npaper checks, and the new technology at that time allowed for what is essentially an electronic \nversion of paper checks.  Remarkable  new technology enables the Federal Reserve  to support the \nfinancial  sector in offering an ever -growing array of options  24x7 x365  in a safe and efficient \nmanner .  Providing such payment services is very much consistent with our historical role in the \npayment system , one that has helped banks to meet the needs of business and households  in a \ngrowing economy for over a century ."

        "content": "Statement by \nEsther George  \nPresident, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \non behalf of  \nThe Federal Reserve System  \nbefore the  \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  \nUnited States Senate  \n \n \nSeptember 25 , 2019  \n \n \n\nChairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown and members of the Committee,  thank you for \nthis opportunity.  \nChair Powell has asked me to speak to you today in my role as the Federal Reserve Bank \nleader responsible for  the Federal Reserve’s payments improvement initiative since its beginning \nand as chair of the Finan cial Services Policy Committee  (FSPC) .  The FSPC oversees the \nprovision of payment services to depository institutions and the United States Treasury  by the 12 \nFederal Reserve Banks.   I am pleased to offer my statement for the record as well as an in depth \nstatement on the role of the Federal Re serve in faster payments and the recently announced \nproposal by the Federal Res erve to support faster payments through the  develop ment of  a new \nservice called the FedNow  Service .    \nSince the Federal Reserve’s founding more than a century ago it  has p rovid ed payment \nand settlement services as part of its core function of promoting an accessible, safe and efficient \npayment system .  Today, the Federal Reserve is continuing this important operational role and \npreparing to support the moderniz ation  of our natio n’s p ayment system with capabilities that \nallow payments to move quickly  through a safe and efficient foundation , on top of which \ninnovation and competition can flourish .  \nThis decision was ma de only after three criteria were met.  \nThe first of these crite ria is that other providers alone cannot be expected to provide the \nservice with reasonable effectiveness, scope and equity .  \nOf notable importance  related to this criteri on is the Federal Reserve’s ability to connect \nto more tha n 10,000 financial institutions.  Through these connections, our  existing  payment \nservices allow banks of every size to serve the needs of thousands of communities across the \nUnited States  with com petitive, fair and transparent access.  Providing comprehen sive \n\n2 \n \nnationwide reach is something that we  believe will present significan t challenges to other \nproviders in the current market landscape.  Coming from a region of the country with a \nsignificant number of small community banks serving rural areas of the ce ntral United States, I \ncan tell you the Board’s decision to provide this new service has been well received.  \nThe second criteri on is that there will be a clear public benefit, including promoting the \nintegrity of the payments system and reducing payments s ystem risk.  \nThe Federal Reserve must continue to play an important role in promoting the safety of \nthe U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity in response to \nfinancial turmoil, terrorist attacks, natural disasters and other cr ises.  The FedNow Service will \nallow the Federal Reserve to retain its ability to provide stability and support to the banking \nsystem , as well as promote the development and implementation of industry -wide fraud -\nmitigation  standards.  Development of the service will also enhance safety of the U.S. payment \nsystem by promoting resiliency through redundancy.   \nThe final criteri on is that the Fed be able to fully recover its cost over the long run.  \nThe U.S. payments infrastructu re today includes alternative payment choices and \nproviders.  The Federal Reserve and The Clearing  House today operate competing and \ninteroperable services, which bring important benefits for resiliency and competition.  In all of \nour services , we have bee n able to meet the requirements of the Monetary Control Act for cost \nrecovery that ensures competitive fairness while fulfilling our public policy goals.  We fully \nexpect this will be the case with the FedNow  Service . \nAs was explained in a 2016 GAO study, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has \nlong been judged as effective in promoting accessibility, safety, and efficiency for the nation’s \n\n3 \n \npayment system and its customers1, 2  Last summer , the U.S. Treasury recommended that “ the \nFederal Reserve move quickly to facilitate a faster retail payments system.”3   \nWe are engaging now with stakeholders for their input on features of the FedNow Service \nthrough the Federal Regi ster notice issued last month.  \nI am confident that together we can achieve our public policy objectives for broad ly \naccess ible, safe  and efficient faster payments.   \nThank you.  I am happy to respond to  your questions.  \n                                                           \n1 “Federal Reserve’s Competition with Other Providers Benefits Customers, but Additional Reviews Could Increase \nAssurance of Cost Accuracy.”  U.S. Government Accountability Office.

        "content": "Opening Remarks  by Esther L. George  \nAt the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium , \n“Challenges  for Monetary Policy ” \nAugust 22, 2019  \n \nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to beautiful Jackson Hole, Wyoming and to the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s economic symposium titled “Challenges \nfor Monetary Policy.”   \n \nI am pleased to be joined by Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as \nmany of my current and former colleagues from the Federal Reserve; and by other \ncentral bankers, academics, and policymakers from around the globe.   \n \nThis year marks the 43rd economic symposium , and with its long history comes an \nassociation with m any distinguished individuals. Sadly, we lost two such \nindividuals this year, both of whom were significant contributors to t he discussion \nin Jackson Hole. And because of that, I want to  take a moment  to remember Alan \nKrueger and Marty Feldstein for their important contributions  and for their \nfriendship . \n \nAlan Krueger joined us at several symposiums both as chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers and as a professor at Princeton University. He was always a \ngracio us and thoughtful participant. Those who were with us here last year will \nrecall that Alan was the featured luncheon speaker and offered keen insights on \nchanges in worker bargaining power and implications for monetary policy.  \n \n\nMarty and Kate Feldstein attended many s ymposiums here, and Marty was on the \nprogram some 18 times. His influential contributions to the economics profession  \nand to public service will long be remembered.  He was a wonderful mentor and \nwe are grateful for his advice and input over the years as we considered  topics and \nspeakers  for this program .  \n \nAlan Krueger and Marty Feldstein were exceptional in many ways , and both of \nthem will be greatly missed.  \n \nAs we considered the topic for this year’s symposium, we were mindful that a \ndecade beyond the global financial crisis, central bankers face a range of \nchallenges as they pursue their mandates. Differen ces in econ omic conditions \nacross countries have contributed to a divergence in policy path s with implications \nfor exchange rates, trade, and ultimately economic activity. The buildup and \neventual unwinding of balance sheet policies have implications for capital mark ets \nand fina ncial flows between countries. And a s central banks have looked to \nnormaliz e policy settings, the prospect of lower neutral rates of interest has \nemerged across the globe. While charting a course to pursue their mandates under \nthese circumstances, central banks also must take into account the influences of \ncommodity and financial markets.   \n \nWithout question, it’s a complex ecosystem in which central bank ers seek an \nequilibr ium. And o ur setting here in the Grand Teton National Park  is perhaps the \nideal place to contemplate such challenges given the very c omplex natural  \necosystem  that exists here .   \n \n\nYou will find that t he national park is home to a variety of species – elk, m oose, \nbison, and grizzly bears to name a few. These animals co-exist  in an equilibrium \nthat provides mutual benefits when they respect each other’s territory. As the park \nrangers will tell you , some of the se animals establish large territories referred to as \nhome ranges. When the home ranges of different animals overlap , or one animal \nintrudes on another’s territory, things get a little more interesting.  That said, the \npark rangers assure me  that such encounters or even aggression are generally \nresolved  without bloodshed , typically with retreat of the intruder.  \n \nWe also know that n atural ecosystems are quite sensitive to change and restoring \nthe e quilibrium after a disruption can prove challenging . Earlier this week, I \nattended a talk hosted here at the Jackson Lake L odge that also may provide \nlessons for the ecosystem in which central bankers operate. In this talk, the speaker \nreviewed the history of Grizzly bears  in Yellowstone. He explained that, a s the \nrailroad was constructed across Wyomi ng in the 1800s , hotels began to spring up \nto provide accommodation s for travelers.   \n \nAfter serving meals, t he hotel kitchens would toss out the scraps a short distance \nfrom the kitchen door , which  as you might imagine,  eventually attracted the grizzly \nbears. A s it turned out, the tourists quite enjoyed watching the bears feed and at \nfirst, it seemed harmless, even beneficial – but there  were unintended \nconsequences. The bears began to prefer this new source of food to the detriment \nof their health a nd the safety of the tourists. Eventually, the park service put a stop \nto this practice with a difficult transition to a new equilibrium – getting the \ngrizzlies to return to their natural diet. And to preserve the restored equilibrium , \nyou will find today clea rly posted across the national park  a very familiar sign : Do \nnot feed the bears.  \n\n \nWhether or not central bankers can actually draw any lessons from this natural \necosystem,  I highly recommend while you’re here that you do not feed the bears \nand avoid encounters with them while hiking in their territory.  \nAgain, thank you for coming , and  I look forward to the presentation s and \ndiscussion s of the excellent papers prepared for this year’s program and the \ninsights from all of you on the challenges for monet ary policy ."

I want to  thank the organizers and , in particular , Már and the Central \nBank of Iceland for inviting me to participate in this program.  It is timely to consider the lessons \nlooking back and to continue to do the hard work of implementing needed cha nge to secure and \npreserve monetary and financial stability. Preserving  that stability is especially important today \nas central banks work within more limited policy space and , to varying degrees , under challenges \nto independence.  \nThis month marks th e tenth year of expansion of the U.S. economy, now the longest \neconomic expansion in its history.  This long period of expansion has been one of generally \nmoderate growth , but also a period during which the stance of monetary policy remained \naccommodative  for many years,  only recently approaching what appears to be a neutral level.  \nThe unemployment rate, currently at 3.7 percent, remains below most assessments of its long -run \nnatural level and stands in stark contrast to its peak of 10 percent nearly a decade ago. Inflation \nhas remained low and relatively stable throughout this period even as labor markets tightened, \nwages moved higher and domestic demand grew . After years of accommodative policy, the U.S. \neconomy appears to be performing reasonably well  notwithstanding the emerging downside risks  \ncoming from slower global growth and trade policy uncertainty.  Even as the U.S. economy has \nachieved a degree of stability , the prolonged low rate environment accompanied by \nunconventional policy has increased risk appetites  and influenced asset values.  And signs of \nfinancial imbalances are growing, while capital in the nation’s largest banking organizations is \nnot.  \nSecuring economic and f inancial stability for the long -run health  of the macroeconomy  \nrequires balancing monetary policy calibration with an understanding of potential vulnerabilities \nin the financial system . This remains a focus in the United States. My comments today will look \n\n \n2 \n at the nature of current financial vulner abilities  and the challenges I see associated with \nresponding to those vulnerabilities at this stage of the expansion.    \n \nThe Expanded Regulatory Toolkit  \n Following the 2008 -09 financial crisis, massive regulatory change came from legislation \nknown as the 2010 Dodd -Frank Act  and revamped supervisory approaches and keener attention \nto financial stability. Among improvement s in U.S. bank regulatory policy and the  tools \nimplemented to evaluate and promote financial stability , the supervisory stress tests have been a \nkey innovation for assessing the level of capital  in the banking system . This analytical exercise \nprovides a quantitative and comprehensive process for evaluating the sufficiency of an individual  \nbank’s capital , as well as aggregate levels of capita l in the system,  to offset losses that stem from \na simulated stress  environment.  In addition  to stress testing , regulatory capital requirements for \nthe largest banks have been strengthened through more rigorous risk -weighting approaches and \nincreased l everage capital requirements.  To address cyclical concerns about financial stability \nrisk, the Federal Reserve now has the authority to impose a countercyclical capital buffer \n(CCyB ) requirement on the largest banks.  On the other hand, its authorities  related to its role as \nlender of last resort were constrained.  \n Regulatory changes for the largest banks also have  improved their liquidity cushions . \nThese firms  now hold a larger amount of high -quality liquid assets  and must routinely \ndemonstrate their ability to meet short -term liquidity demands . Efforts are underway to develop  \nrequirement s to address longer -term liquidity risk.   \nIn addition, U.S. regulators implemented structural reforms in derivatives markets, \nincluding promotion of central clearing and swap execution facilities, margin requirements, \n\n \n3 \n improved reporting , and bank capital rules for derivatives . Money market mutual fund \nregulations were implemented to reduce run risk in these funds.  Finally, the Finan cial Stability \nOversight Council was formed along with the Office of Financial Research.  \nTaken  together, t hese changes undoubtedly have improved the overall health  and \nresiliency  of the U.S. financial system . Whether these steps will prove robust to a fut ure shock \nhowever has yet to be tested.   \n \nIdentifying Vulnerabilities  \nIdentifying vulnerabilities has taken on renewed focus. To that end, t he Federal Reserve  \npublishes its assessment of risks and vulnerabilities in the economy twice  each year.  The \nframework used by the Fed looks at vulnerabilities across four dimensions:  1) asset valuations; \n2) household and business debt; 3) leverage in the financial sector; and 4) funding risks.   \nThe most recent financial stability report highlights a variety of r isks and vulnerabilities.  \nAmong them, for example, corporate leverage in the United States  has grown rapidly and is at a \nrecord level. The amount of outstanding debt among the corporate sector in the United States  has \ngrown to an unprecedented amount durin g the long expansionary period. Non -financial \ncorporations now have approximately $6 trillion in outstanding debt, roughly twice the amount \nof debt outstanding at the beginning of the expansion. Much of the growth in corporate debt \noutstanding is due to bo rrowing by firms that were already highly leveraged.  \nThe ratings for many of these corporate bonds are at the margin of investment grade and \nare at risk of being downgraded if economic conditions were to deteriorate.  In addition, the \nstandards for leverag ed corporate loans have declined steadily in recent years as loan structures \nand covenants have weakened.  \n\n \n4 \n With much of the recent growth in leveraged borrowing funded by non -bank lenders, \nvulnerabilities that originate outside the banking sector could pos e substantial challenges for both \nthe macroeconomy and U.S. banks during times of financial stress. Close links between the \ntraditional banking sector and the so -called shadow banking sector are evident, but not well -\nunderstood. However, d isruptions in the  corporate debt markets are likely to flow through these \nlinks and raise demands for short -term funding from banks during a period of market stress . A \ndecline in investor demand for corporate debt could also create loan syndicate pipeline risk and \ndownward  pressure on values that would have adverse impacts on banks.  More broadly, a \ndisruption in corporate debt markets could cause broader spillover effects on other assets classes, \nwhere values are currently elevated, adversely impacting overall bank health a nd the \nmacr oeconomy . For this reason, a focus on the stability of the banking system is essential .  \nIdentifying risks  is clearly important. Equally important  is understanding what tools are \nat our disposal to address such concerns.  In the case of the United States , this is very much a \nwork in progress .  \n In my view, monetary policy settings are not well suited to react, notwithstanding the \neffect it may have in influencing the conditions around risk and investor’s reach for yield.  And, it \nseems to me,  macroprudential approaches are desirable in theory but face considerable challe nge \naround the age -old issues of being delivered timely and potently , at least in the  United States’ \nexperience. O ther countries have different macroprudentia l loan-to-value  measures  to use .  \nWithin the Federal Reserve , a number of my colleagues and I participated in a tabletop  \nexercise a few years ago.  The exercise w as designed to assess the efficacy  of certain \nmacroprudential tools in responding to a hypothetical financial crisis. In the exercise, we \nexamined the use of capital -based, liquidity -based, and credit -based tools, along with stress \n\n \n5 \n testing and supervisory guidance in mitigating the effects  of an overheating of the financial \nmarkets. What we discovered in conducting the exercise was that the effectiveness of the tools \nvaried because of realities like implementation lags and/or limited scope.  Clearly, this particular \nexercise is not conclusiv e in all scenarios, but it cautions against becoming overly confident in \nrelying on macroprudential tools to address growing financial imbalances.1  \n I’d like to mention two potential macroprudential approaches in play: the CCyB and \nstress testing.   \n The CCyB,  as I noted earlier, is a new authority granted the Federal Reserve post-\nfinancial crisis . Based on the framework approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2016 , the \nCCyB is designed to be implemented while economic growth is healthy, bank profitability  is \nrising and financial stability risks  are “contained , but above normal .”  \n  Based on t he Federal Reserve Board’s assessment, the CCyB has not bee n deployed and \nremains at zero, c oncluding that financial risk is not meaningfully above normal.   \n A second tool, stress testing , has been considered.  The supervisory stress  tests have been \nviewed as a more  dynamic method for evaluating capital against vulnerabilities.  Stress tests are \nforward looking , and by choosing adverse scenarios carefully, the tests can b e used to measure \nexposure to specific risks , such as those  associated with real estate or  rapidly  growing corporate \nleverage.  While the stress testing exercise has been a  useful tool to gauge bank capitalization and \npromote safety and soundness, the underlying assumptions are subject to certain limitations.   All \nmodel results have some degree of uncertainty, especially when the current vulnerabilities , such \nas in leveraged corporate debt,  represent uncharted territory . Stress test results need to be \ninterpreted carefully and used among other indicators of resiliency.   \n                                                 \n1 Tobias Adrian, Patrick de Fontnouvelle, Emily Yang, and Andrei Zlate, “Macro -prudential Policy: A Case Study \nfrom a Tabletop Exercise,” FRBN Y Economic Policy Review, February 2017.  \n\n \n6 \n Some have argued that stress tests are counter -cyclical in that more stringent scenarios \ncreated during good times encourage (even require) banks to build capital during periods of \neconom ic growth, thereby preparing for future downturns.  I find little evidence that stress tests \nhave done this.  The latest results of the Federal Reserve stress tests that were released last month \nconcluded all have sufficient capital and all were permitted to  proceed  with capital distribution \nand stock b uybac ks. Despite continued economic growth, actual capital ratios on a consolidated \nbasis for the largest banking organizations have not increased in recent years.2 Instead , \nSupplementary Leverage Ratio s (SLRs) have declined in recent years. In addition, recent  \nresearch has shown that the stress tests have not required banks to build capital.3 After \ndistributions and stock buybacks, the losses (declines in capital) in stress scenarios have been \nsmaller over the last few years.  Banks only need to add capital (or reduce capital distributions) \nwhen losses push projected capital ratios below req uired minimums.  These results suggest  that \nstress tests cannot be relied upon to make banks build capital as we progress thr ough the \neconomic cycle. The prospect of the stress tests not having the desired counter -cyclical outcomes \nshould have the attention of bank regulators and supervisors against a backdrop of increasing \nvulnerabilities .  \n \n \nConclusion  \n                                                 \n2 For the larger “advanced approaches” banking organizations, the average Tier 1 leverage ratio declined from 9.0 \npercent at December 2016 to 8.7 percent at December 2017 to 8.5 percent at December 2018.  \n3 Berrospide, Jose, Andrew Cohen, Ronel Elul, David Hou, Aytek Malkhozov, Marc Rodriguez, and Robert Sarama \n(2019). \"Cyclicality and the Severity of the U.S. Supervisory Stress Test: 2014 to 2018,\" FEDS Notes. Washington: \nBoard of Governors of the Federal Re serve System, June 7, 2019, https://doi.org/10.17016/2380 -7172.2393.  \n\n \n7 \n Looking back, the lessons of the financial crisis should  remain in front of us. They were \ncostly to learn.  \n Even as we work to develop the most effective macroprudential  tools, we must take to \nheart the important lesson of bank capital as the single most important element in our framework \nfor financial stability . It serves as a buffer.  Whether or not our judgments about the size or scope \nor timing of risk is properly judged, h igher capitalized banks have been shown to lend through \nthe cycle at a higher rat e than those with lower capital and are much less likely to fail.  \nIf we are to secur e economic financial stability for the future, building stronger capital  is \nessential."

First, let me thank the organizers : the Finnish Government, Governor \nRehn and his staff at the Bank of Finland, and the Global Coalition on Aging for inviting me to \nparticipate in this very important forum on the Silver Economy. It is an honor to join with these \nexperts who bring insight to both the challenges and opportunities we are going to face  with an \naging population.   \nCertainly, d emographic trends are reshaping the U.S. labor force , and it is leading \neconomists and policym akers to rethink the key macroeconomic parameters  that drive our \ndecision making .  Monetary policymakers, like myself , have  had to reassess their views about \nthe economy’s longer -run growth potential, the natural rate of unemployment, and how we think \nabou t interest rates .   \n Like melting glaciers, the changes in global demographic trends are often difficult to see \nin the near term, but over time they will reshape the landscape.  Looking over the past quarter \ncentury at the U.S. economy, structural changes have only gradually  reduced the economy’s \npotential growth rate, its natural rate of interest, and  unemployment , but they must be considered \nin the context of how we respond to business cycle fluctuations and potentially underlying \ninflation.  \n I’d like to make three brief  observations about these demographic trends affecting  the \nlabor force ’s composition , the job market , and the housing market.  Then I will briefly describe \nsome of the challenges monetary  policymakers face as they confront these trends . \n \nLong-Term Trends in the Composition of the U.S. Labor Force  \nFirst, the age of the labor force in the United States has changed significantly over the \npast 25 years . The share of older individuals (age 55 and up) in the labor force has continued to \n\n2 \n increase . Twenty -five years ago, o lder individuals made up roughly 10 percent  of the workforce; \ntoday, that share has more than doubled to over 20 percent . At the same time, the shares of \nprime -age (age 25 to 54) and young individuals (age 16 to 24) in the labor for ce have declined. \nThese d emographic factors, particularly the increasing share of the older so -called baby -boom \ngeneration that are retiring, continue to put downward pressure on labor force participation.  \nStarting in the last recession,  we saw that labor  force parti cipation rate s declined steadily.  \nOver the past five years, the participation rate has stabilized as market conditions have improved \nand boosted participation enough to offset some of the downward pull from an aging population.  \nOne of the impo rtant implications of these long -term demographic changes relevant for \npolicymakers is related to  what is known as  the trend unemployment rate. The unemployment \nrate tells you something about the health of the labor market today, but where it stands in rel ation \nto what we think of as a natural  rate – or a trend unemployment rate – is far more informative for \npolicymakers. Research by my own staff at the Kansas City Fed show s that the changes in the \nage and skill composition of the labor force have systematically lowered the trend \nunemployment  rate over the past 25 years .1   \nAs these estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have declined, the scope for \nmonetary p olicy to foster lower rates of unemployment w ithout generating inflationary pressure s \nhas increased. Of course uncertainty about exactly where those natural rates of unemployment \nmight currently lie requires us to be cautious , examine a wide range of information and \ncontinually update the parameters we use as new data arrive.  \n   \n                                                 \n1 Tüzemen, Didem. \"Job polarization and the natural rate of unemployment in the United \nStates.\"  Economics Letters , 175 (2019): 97 -100. \n \n\n3 \n Job P olarization  \nMy second observation is that this shift in the composition of the labor force to older \nwork ers has coincided with  dramatic  changes in skills demanded by employers .  This change, \ndue to technological advancements , has resulted in a phenomenon known  as job polarization. \nMore specifically, job opportunities have shifted away from middle -skill occupations  that lead to \na middle -class standard of living  and toward high - and low -skill occupations . \nSkills demanded in the labor market are rapidly changing, and technological \nadvancement has rendered the skills of many less -educated workers obsolete. As we’ ve \nwitnessed in the U.S. , this lack of job opportunit y, in turn, may lead to depression and illness \namong displaced workers, and these health conditions may become further barriers to their \nemployment. E quipping workers with the new skills employers are demanding in the face of \nrapid technological advancement s continues to be a key issue for labor force  participation and  \npolicy makers .  \n \nDemographic Forces and the Housing Outlook  \n Finally,  my third observation relates to how  these demographic forces are interacting \nwith, and influencing the outlook for, key sec tors of the U.S. economy.  In the housing sector, for \nexample, a combination of forces has  resulted in high levels of housing prices and rents . These \nhigh prices  disproportionately impact younger adults , and as a  consequence younger adults are \ndelaying for ming their own households. For example, the share of adults in their late twenties \nthrough late thirties living with their parents has increased steadily.  This delayed household \nformation is also likely contributing to young a dults delaying marriage  and h aving children.  \n\n4 \n Looking forward,  downsizing by baby boomers could  significantly increase demand for \nnew multifamily construction, especially in metropolitan suburbs. This downsizing , together \nwith the mor tality associated with age , would be expected to free up existing single -family \nhomes for re -occupancy. Younger households who move into these homes from rental units  will \nin turn free up multifamily units for newly forming households.  \n With housing being a key fulcrum of monetary policy and a sector we kno w can be prone \nto boom and bust cycles, these developments will require careful monitoring.   \n \nImplications for Monetary Policy  \n This brings me to the implications of demographic change and other key structural \neconomic relationships for monetary policy.  We have already seen this play out at the Federal \nOpen Market Committee in terms of revisiting our estimates of economic  parameters. For \nexample, according to the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections,  popularly \nreferred to as the “dot plot,”  the median projection for the long -run growth rate of real GDP has \ncome down, t he median projection for the long -run unemployment rate has also fallen \ndramatically a nd the median projection for the long -run interest rates has come down notably .    \n Understa nding of cours e that considerable uncertainty remains around these estimates,  \npolicymakers must remain attuned to changes in macroeconomic trends such as aging \ndemographics if we are to achieve our object ives for the economy."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 14, 2019  \nEconomic Club of Minnesota  \nMinneapolis, Minn.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n Thank you. I’m delighted to be here.  \nMy remarks today will focus on a question that garners  a great deal of attention  for those  \nwho follow Fed policy .  It is a question about whether the current level of inflation is too low. Of \ncourse, understanding the drivers of inflation dynamics is an essential part of the Federal Open \nMarket Committee’s (FOMC)  work.   \n  As central banks have done in other countries, t he Federal Reserve announced last \nNovember its plans to review its monetary policy strategy, tools  and communications practices.   \nThis review strikes me as appropriate given the changes that occur over time in  our economy,  but \nit may be especially important now  in a low interest rate environment . I look forward to the ideas \nthat may come forward as part of  this review , even as I offer  a few preliminary thoughts of my \nown today on the F ederal Reserve’s price sta bility mandate, and the FOMC’s inflation objective \nand policy strategies.   Before I do that, I’ll begin with my views on the economic outlook for the \nnation and monetary policy settings.  \n \nEconomic Outlook  \n Last year, the U.S. economy enjoyed robust growth boosted by accommodative monetary \nand fiscal policies.  As the stimulus from these policies wanes, and with slower foreign  growth, I \nexpect to see a slower pace of growth – somewhere in the neighborhood of the economy’s \nlonger -run trend of roughly 2 percen t.  \n As you know, real gross domestic product (GDP) – our broadest, if not the timeliest, \nmeasure of economic activity  – came in at a stronger -than-expected annual growth rate of 3.2 \npercent in the first quarter.  However, beneath this robust  headline numb er, real final sales to \ndomestic purchasers grew at a more modest 1.3 percent rate  – a clear slowing from its pace in \n\n \n2 \n recent years.  In contrast, inventory investment and net exports contributed a combined 1.7 \npercentage points to overall growth.  Inventories and net exports are volatile and difficult to \npredict.  Based on this underlying data, I would expect to see less contribution from these sectors \nin coming quarter s and a greater contribution from domestic final sales.  \n My outlook for  continued  but somewhat more moderate growth is tied to expectations \nthat job gains, wage increases and  consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer \nspending .  Total nonfarm payroll employment  increased by 263,000 in April after increasing \n189,000 in March.  Over the last three months, j ob gains have averaged 169,000 per month , well \nabove the esti mated  number required to keep the unemployment rate steady.  As a result, we \nhave seen a further decline in the unemployment rate to 3.6 percent in April, the lowest rate since \nDecember 1969.   \n As the job market has tightened , labor compensation has steadily accelerated .  Average \nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual growth rate of roughly 2½ percent in 2017 to 3 \npercent last year, and 3 .3 percent in the first quarter of this year.   With low rates of inflation, \nworkers are beginning to se e signi ficant gains in real wages .  Although consumer confidence was \nbuffeted  early in the year  by the government shutdown  and financial market volatility , it bounced \nback in the spring and remains near its post -recession high.  I am also encouraged to see a  \nrelatively high personal saving rate ( 6.5 percent in March 2019 ), which suggests consumers have \nthe wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse shock.  \nAnother reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that \nbusiness spending has picked up following  the sharp slowdown in 2015 -16.  While I don’t expect \nto see the same robust growth of business fixed investment that we saw last year, I do expect to \nsee it make a positive contribution to overall growth.  The waning of the fiscal stimulus, higher \n\n \n3 \n interest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity.  Still, business \noptimism remains high, and the ou tlook for sales and profits over the medium term remains \nsolid.  \nAs always, there are risks to the outlook , and this generally positive outlook  has several  \nprominent downside risks .  Over the medium term, I see the biggest risk s coming from trade \npolicy un certainty and slower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and the United \nKingdom.    To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary stimulus \nrepresent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we c ould see \nsomewhat slower growth.  Right now the data are noisy , and we need more time and evidence to \njudge whether this risk materializes .   \nFinally , the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign  and, in my view, broadly \nconsistent with our price  stability mandate . While inflation has declined over the course of this \nyear, last year at this time it was near 2 percent.  On a month -to-month basis, movements in \ninflation are  typically  dominated by transitory factors such as changes in energy and import \nprices.  More fundamentally, to the extent beneficial supply side developments such as increased \nproductivity growth may be pushing inflation down, they promote higher real wages and , \nultimately, higher  standards of living.  \n \nOutlook for Monetary Policy  \n At its April meeting the FOMC  maintained the target range for the federal funds rate at \n2¼ to 2½ percent and indicated that it could be patient as it determines whether future \nadjustments  to the target range may be appropriate.  I supported that decision.  This wait -and-see \n\n \n4 \n approach is appropriate because we have not seen upward pressures building on inflation, even \nthough we have experienced above trend growth and a further tightening of labor markets.    \nOver the course of this year , I will be looking for evidence on the amount of slack, if any, \nthat remains in labor  markets; signs that businesses are changing their pricing behavior ; and \nevidence that longer -run inflation expectations could be signaling a lack of confidence in the \nFed’s ability to achieve its longer -run inflation objective  of 2 percent.  I’ll also  be evaluating the \nstance of policy relative to the estimates of the long -run neutral policy rate  – the interest rate \nconsistent with price stability and maximum employment.  This rate has apparently declined over \nthe past decade, but its precise level is uncertain and subject to change.  \n \nThe Balanced Approach  \n Fostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of  course the core of \nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress.  Wit h the unemployment rate at  an historic \nlow level and inflation currently running under the FOMC’s  objective, a  longer -run policy issue \nis whether the persistent undershoot of the inflation objective is undermining its credibility and \ncausing inflation to be anchor ed at too low a level.  Some have expressed concern that i f inflation \nexpectations fall persistently  below the 2 percent  objective , that the extent we could lower real \ninterest rate s by reducing our target for the federal funds rate  – the Fed’s key policy tool  – would \nbe diminished . This could limit the accommodation we could provide in a future downturn \nbecause interest rates cannot fall below a lower bound of roughly zer o percent.       \nAt the time the FOMC  adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012 , monetary policy \nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and  inflation was \nrunning above 2 percent.   Since then, inflation has run pe rsistently below 2 percent.   I have not \n\n \n5 \n viewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy \nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable. Since 2012, core PCE inflation has \nfluctuated in a range of r oughly 1½ to 2 percent , except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed  \ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent .   \nAs long as inflation was below its objective and unemployment was above its longer -run \nlevel, it was appropriate to run an accommodative  policy to promote the movement of both \nvariables back toward their longer -run sustainable levels.  Accommodative policies tend to lower \nunemployment and, generally  speaking , increase inflation.  \nBut with the unemployment rate now below its longer -run level, s hould we still be \nconcerned about inflation  running slightly below target ?  As I listen to business and community \nleaders around my region, I hear few complaints about inflation being too low.  In fact, I am \nmore likely to hear disbelief when I mention tha t inflation is as low as measured in a number of \nkey sectors.   \nThis leads me to the observation that inflation as experienced by households and \nbusinesses is fundamentally different from inflation as viewed by financial market participants \nand many econom ists.  Households see the prices  of everyday goods such as food, energy, rents, \nand health care rising and don’t understand why the Fed would be concerned that inflation is too \nlow. Their short -run expectations for inflation are driven largely by changes i n retail gasoline \nprices while their longer -run expectations, as measured by the University of Michigan, have been \nfairly stable . (Expected changes in prices during the next 5 years have fluctuated between 2.3 \nand 2.6 percent since January 2018  and are cur rently at 2.3 percent. ) \nBusinesses see their labor and other input costs rising, and with limited pricing power, \nsee their profit margins squeezed.  For them, the product prices they charge are determined by \n\n \n6 \n structural factors such as global competition an d technological disruption that don’t  necessarily  \nrespond to monetary policy , while their costs are driven by tight labor and commodity  market \nconditions . In the April  survey of small businesses conducted by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business,  only 1 percent of respondents said inflation was their single most \nimportant problem, compared with 24 percent who said “quality of labor” and 8 percent who said \n“cost of labor.”  \nIn contrast, financial market participants see inflation and inflation expec tations as key \ndriver s of monetary policy decisions. They look at past, current, and expected future inflation \nrelative to target to form a view about the policy path that they then use to price financial market \ninstruments.  If they perceive the 2 percent  inflation objective as a line in the sand that the Fed \ndoes not want to overshoot , they may come to expect inflation to run belo w 2 percent over the \nlonger run. This concern has led to calls for the Fed to ease rates to push inflation and inflation \nexpect ations higher in an effort to  maintain the credibility  of the target  and preserve policy space.  \nBut even if such a policy  were  effective, how is policy space preserved if rates have to be cut to \nboost  longer -run inflation expectations?   \nEven with these concerns , I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longer -\nrun objective for inflation  in 2012 , and I support it today .  I believe it has been effective in \nhelping anchor longer -run inflation expectations.  Arguably, though, adopting a point est imate \ninstead of a range has placed considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the \nprecision with which monetary policy can a chieve this goal .1  It would seem reasonable that even \n                                                 \n1 Jon Faust and Eric Leeper  describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to \nexplain movements in inflation with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates” \nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary polic y,” in “ The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of \nInflation and Monetary Policy ,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, \nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015, \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en . \n \n\n \n7 \n somewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if th ey are limited to, say 50 basis points \nabove or below , may be acceptable  taken in the context of  broader economic conditions.  \nThe FOMC anticipated that its objectives for employment and inflation cou ld move in \ndifferent directions . It addresses this issue  in its annual  “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and \nMonetary Policy Strategy,” noting that when its objectives are not complementary, the \nCommittee follow s a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of \nthe deviations and the pot entially different time horizons over which employment and inflation \nare projected to return to mandate -consistent levels.   \nWhat this means is that we should not focus on one leg of the mandate without \nconsideration for the other.  For example, cutting in terest rates today to boost inflation to 2 \npercent at some point in the future would likely cause labor markets to tighten further, leading to \na reallocation of resources into the most interest sensitive sectors.  Given the current \nunresponsiveness of infl ation to labor market tightness , it might take a considerable further \neasing of policy and considerable further  tightening of labor market conditions to have the \ndesired impact on inflation.   And given the lags with which monetary policy operates, it may \ntake a considerable period of time.  In the meantime, lower interest rates  might fuel asset price \nbubbles , create financial imbalances, and ultimately a recession.  \nIn current circumstances, with an unemployment rate well below its projected longer -run \nlevel, I see little reason to be concerned about inflation running a bit below its longer -run \nobjective.  Moreover, I am not convinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below objective \nrequir es an offsetting overshoot of the objective.   As I mentioned earlier, the current benign \ninflation outlook gives us the opportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the \neconomy and the level of the n eutral  rate of interest.  \n\n \n8 \n Conclusions  \nWith the current outlook for the economy remaining positive, monetary policy settings \nlook appropriate to me.  As we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary \npolicy “space” could be limited in response to a future downturn because o f the low level of \ninterest rates.2 This has led some to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some \nkind of a price -level target.  While I see little value in pursuing a higher inflation target given the \ncredibility we have built over the last decade around 2 percent, the Federal Reserve will be \nseeking ideas and input on alternative policy strategies next month at a conference hosted by the \nChicago Fed.3  It will be an opportunity to learn  more about the pros and cons of different \napproach es for our monetary  policy strategy, tools, and communications practices.   \nThe current level of inflation may perplex central bankers and financial market \nparticipants, but in the context of a growing economy and job gains, it doesn’t demand a Fed \npolicy response  in my view.   Steering what is currently a low and stable rate of inflation up by \n20-50 basis points to reach a precise numerical target , while  disregarding the labor market, the \nother leg of our dual mandate, strikes me as a degree of fine -tuning  that goes beyond our span of \ncontrol .  \n \n                                                 \n2Other government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might cont ribute to faster \ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby providing additional monetary policy space.  Moreover, \nthe prospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need \nto be on the menu of possible counter -cyclical options.  \n3 Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession, \nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hit ting the zero lower bound \n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at the ZLB in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit: \nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future , Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas  City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en ."

With 17 participants currently sitting on the  Federal \nOpen Market Committee  (FOMC ), the public has access to a variety of perspectives and insights \non the U.S. economy and monetary policy.  Some have  argue d that communication from this \nlarge number of policymakers  can confuse the public about our policy path.  That potential exists.  \nOn net, though, I think the Federal Reserve System ’s transparency is a strength, giving financial \nmarkets and the broader public a sense of the diversity of views that come to bear on  policy \nstrategy, tactics and stance.   \n In my remarks t his evening , I’ll offer  my views on the economic outlook and  monetary \npolicy, focusing in particular on how I think about our price stability mandate and related \ncommunications.1 As central banks have done in other countries, t he Federal Reserve announced \nlast November its plans to review its monetary policy strategy, tools  and communications \npractices.2 This review strikes me as appropriate under any circumstance  given the ongoing \nevolution of the economy . But it may be especially important now in a low interest rate \nenvironment given the real possibility  of a future  return to the zero lower bound . In the spirit of \nthis review, I ’ll offer  a few preliminary thoughts on the FOMC’s inflation objective and policy \nstrategies.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 I would like to thank George Kahn for his assistance in preparing these remarks.  \n2 Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications, \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review -of-monetary -policy -strategy -tools -and-\ncommunications.htm . See also, Richard Clarida, “The Federal Reserve’s Review of Its Monetary Policy Strategy, \nand Communication Practices, https: //www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/clarida20190222a.htm . \n \n\n \n \n2 \n Economic Outlook  \n I’ll begin with a brief review of the economic outlook . Last year, the U.S. economy \nenjoyed robust growth boosted  by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.  As the stimulus \nfrom these policies wanes, and global growth slows, I expect a deceleration this year toward the \neconomy’s longer -run growth trend of roughly 2 percent.   \n My outlook for  continued, but somewhat more moderate growth, is tied to expectations \nthat job gains, wage increases and consumer confidence will remain supportive of consumer \nspending . Although the monthly increase in payroll employment fell to just 20,000  last month , \nthe previous two months were revised up and, averaging over the last three months, employment \nincreased by a strong  186,000 jobs  per month . Weaker aspects of the February jobs report \nsuggest the  unusually harsh winter weather negatively impact ed constructio n employment and \nspending on entertainment . While I would expect to see a rebound in March , employment growth \nwill likely slow to a rate more consistent with the net rate of entry into the labor force . \nAs the job market has tightened , labor compensation has steadily accelerated . Average \nhourly earnings have climbed from an annual rate of roughly 2½ percent last February t o almost \n3½ percent this February.  And w ith low rates of inflation, workers are beginning to se e \nsignificant real i ncome gains.  Real personal disposable income increased almost 4 percent last \nyear on a twelve -month basis.  Although consumer confidence has been buffeted by the \ngovernment shutdown, financial market volatility, and a softening of employment growth in \nFebru ary, consumers continue to expect the economy to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace \nthan last year.  Moreover, given the relatively high personal saving rate (7.6 percent in December \n2018), consumers have the wherewithal to maintain spending in the event of a temporary adverse \nshock.  \n\n \n \n3 \n Another reason I expect the economy to maintain its forward momentum in 2019 is that \nbusinesses have increased capital spending after the sharp slowdown in 2015 -16. While I don’t \nexpect to see the same robust growth of busines s fixed investment that we saw last year, I do \nexpect to see it make a positive contribution to overall growth.  The waning of the fiscal stimulus, \nhigher interest rates, and lower oil prices will all contribute to a slower pace of activity.  Still, \nbusiness  optimism remains high, and the outlook for sales and profits over the medium term \nremains solid.  \nAs always, there are risks to the outlook , and this generally positive outlook  has several  \nprominent downside risks . Tracking measures of first quarter growt h appear to be weak, but \ncould well reflect the influence of  transitory factors such as the government shutdown, financial \nvolatility, an unusually harsh winter , and heightened p olicy uncertainty.  Over the medium term, I \nsee the biggest risk coming from sl ower growth abroad, particularly in China, the euro area, and \nthe United Kingdom . To the extent slower foreign growth and waning fiscal and monetary \nstimulus represent a stronger headwind than I am building into my baseline forecast, we could \nsee somewhat slower growth.  Right now the data are noisy , and we need more time and evidence \nto separate the signal from the noise .  \nFinally , the current outlook for inflation appears to be benign , and I consider the recent \nbehavior of inflation to be broadly consistent with our price stability mandate.   \n \nOutlook for monetary policy  \nWith the solid expansion experienced over the past few years and a generally positive \noutlook over the medium term , the Federal Reserve has been in a position to remove much of the \npolicy accommodation that was put in place during the  financial crisis and Great Recession.  In \n\n \n \n4 \n addition  to raising short -term rates 225 basis points , the Fed’s balance sheet has been slowly \nshrink ing as securities have matured.  At its meeting last week, th e FOMC noted it would \nconclude the reduction of its securities holdings by the end of September.3 With high levels of \nemployment and low inflation readings, the FOMC has judged it can be patient in determining \nwhether it needs to take any further policy ac tions.  I supported that decision.  \n \nEvaluating our inflation objective  \n Fostering a strong labor market while maintaining price stability is of course the core of \nthe Federal Reserve’s dual mandate from Congress.  With the unemployment rate at  a historic ally \nlow level and inflation currently running just under the FOMC’s  objective, a  longer -run policy \nissue is whether the persistent undershoot of our inflation objective is undermining its credibility \nand causing inflation to be anchor ed at too low a level.  If inflation expectations fall persistently  \nbelow 2 percent , the extent we could lower real interest rate s by reducing our nominal target for \nthe funds rate would be diminished . This could limit the accommodation we could provide if we \nwere to return to th e zero lower bound.   \nAt the time the FOMC  adopted its 2 percent inflation objective in 2012 , monetary policy \nwas highly accommodative, unconventional policy tools were being deployed, and  inflation was \nrunning above 2 percent.  Since then, inflation has run  persistently below 2 percent.  I have not \nviewed this as a major concern given that, aside from the effects of wide fluctuations in energy \nprices, inflation has remained low and relatively stable.  Since 2012, core PCE inflation has \nfluctuated in a range of  roughly 1½ to 2 percent , except during 2015 when a strong dollar pushed  \ncore inflation somewhat below 1½ percent  \n                                                 \n3 For information about the Committee’s plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer -\nrun operating regime, see https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy -normalization.htm . \n\n \n \n5 \n Should we be concerned about this low level of inflation?  As I listen to business and \ncommunity leaders around my region, I hear few complaint s about inflation being too low.  In \nfact, I am more likely to hear disbelief when I mention that inflation is as low as measured in a \nnumber of key sectors.  I see this reaction to inflation as a good sign, and consider this \nperformance consistent with the definition of price stability that Paul Volcker and Alan \nGreenspan preferred . Both of them  judged price s tability as an inflation rate that is sufficiently \nlow [and stable] that it is not considered a key factor in the decisions of businesses or \nhouseholds .  \nEven so , I supported the FOMC’s decision to adopt a 2 percent longer -run objective for \ninflation  in 2012 , and I support it today . I believe it has been effective in helping anchor longer -\nrun inflation expectations.  Arguably, though, adopting a point estimate instead of a range has \nplaced considerable attention on a precise target and has exaggerated the precision with which \nmonetary policy can achieve this particular numerical target.4 It would seem reasonable that even \nsomewhat persistent deviations from the objective, if they are limited to, say 50 basis points \nabove or below the objective may be acceptable, depending on broader economic conditions.  \nI also support the idea that the objective should be symmetric so that deviations below \nand above the objective should be viewed as costly, taking into account deviations of \nemployment from our employment objective. Consistent with  the FOMC’s  “Statement on \nLonger -Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” this suggests th at when our objectives are not \ncomple mentary, we follow a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the \n                                                 \n4 Jon Faust and Eric Leeper describe the “disparate confounding dynamics” of inflation that makes it difficult to \nexplain movements in inflati on with a small number of “conventional summary statistics for headline aggregates” \nand “complicates the nature of appropriate monetary policy,” in “ The Myth of Normal: The Bumpy Story of \nInflation and Monetary Policy ,” Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, \nJackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium, August 2015, \nhttps://www.kansa scityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2015/2015faust_leeper.pdf?la=en . \n \n\n \n \n6 \n magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment \nand inflation are projected to return to mandate -consistent levels.  In current c ircumstances, with \nan unemployment rate well below its projected longer -run level, I see little reason to be \nconcerned about inflation running a bit below its longer -run objective.  Moreover, I am not \nconvinced that a slight undershoot of inflation below ob jective requires an offsetting overshoot \nof the objective.  As I mentioned earlier, the current benign inflation outlook gives us the \nopportunity to test our assumptions about the degree of slack in the economy and the level of the \nnatural rate of interest.  \nAs we look ahead, however, there is a legitimate concern that monetary policy “space” \ncould  be limited in the next downturn because of the low level of interest rates.5 This has led \nsome to argue for a higher inflation target or the adoption of some kind of a price -level target.  \nWhile I see little value in pursuing  a higher inflation target given the credibility we have built \nover the last decade around 2 percent, evaluating alternative policy strategies is appropriate .6 \nSome have promoted the use of  a tem porary price -level target that takes effect when the federal \nfunds rate target hits the zero bound.  Another approach might be an inflation target that is \nachieved on average over a fixed period of time or over the business cycle.  In theory, a price -\n                                                 \n5Other government policies that focus on productivity growth and labor force participation might contribute to faster \ntrend growth and a higher natural rate of interest, thereby p roviding additional monetary policy space.  Moreover, the \nprospect of a future return to the zero lower bound suggests that, along with monetary policy, fiscal policies need to \nbe on the menu of possible counter -cyclical options.   \n6 Former Federal Reserve C hair Janet Yellen discussed possible monetary policy responses to a future recession, \nincluding the use of an aggressive policy rule for setting the funds rate in advance of hitting the zero lower bound \n(ZLB), and asset purchases and forward guidance at th e ZLB  in “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit: \nPast, Present and Future,” Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future , Federal Reserve Bank \nof Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, August 2016.  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016yellen.pdf?la=en . At the same symposium, \nMarvin Goodfriend discussed the use of negative nominal interest rates in “Th e Case for Unencumbering Interest \nRate Policy at the Zero Bound.”  \nhttps://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/sympos/2016/2016goodfriend.pdf? la=en . \n  \n\n \n \n7 \n level t arget that is fully credible could potential ly smooth fluctuations in output and employment, \nespecially at the zero lower bound.  \nWhile not pre -judging the potential efficacy of such strategies, I see both fundamental \nand practical issues to grapple with in moving to s uch regime s. What works in elegant economic \nmodels can have limitations and unintended consequences when put into practice.  \nFundamentally, an effective price -level target could substantially reduce uncertaint y about the \nprice level many years into the future and thereby help households and businesses make long -\nterm plans and commitments.  It also  could increase the variability  of, and uncertainty about,  \ninflation over the medium term.  This is because a price -level target would require policymakers \nto engineer an increase in inflation in response to the price level falling below its target path and \nengineer a decrease in inflation in response to the price level rising above the target path.  These \nbenefits and cos ts would need to be carefully weighed.  \nOn a more practical level, there are a number of issues to be consider ed. First, in a price -\nlevel targeting regime, choosing  the base period can make a big difference.  For example, getting \nback to a 2 percent price -level path that was based in a year just prior to the Great Recession \nwould require a much longer period of above 2 -percent inflation  than if the base year were set \nmore recently.  This is simpl y because the cumulative undershoot of the 2 -percent price path \nwould be so much greater under  the earlier base period.  \nSecond, g iven the difficulty over the last decade in getting inflation up to 2 percent on a \nsustained basis, it is not clear to me that adopting a price -level target would be any more \neffective than our current inflation target.  And deliberately push ing inflation above 2 percent at a \ntime when  the unemployment rate is well below its presumed longer -run level  could be costly.  It \n\n \n \n8 \n would likely require a further overheating of the labor market with related misallocation of \nresources, along with increased uncertainty about the future inflation rate and price level.  \nThird, a price -level target ing strategy  is time inconsisten t unles s policymakers can \ncredibly commit to following it . If the goal is to have inflation of 2 percent on average, a period \nof below 2 percent inflation would require an equal period of inflation above 2 percent . But once \ninflation has moved up to 2 percent , policymakers might be tempted to renege on their prior \ncommitment and not allow inflation to go higher.  This would undermine the future credibility of \nthe price -level targeting strategy.  To the extent the public understood this time inconsistency \nproblem, pr ice-level targeting would not be credible to begin with, absent a commitment device.  \nWith regular turnover among members of the FOMC, it would be difficult for one Committee to \ncommit a future Committee to a particular course of action.  \nFourth, t he timefra me for achieving an average inflation target  would be difficult to \ndetermine  and communicate . “Over the business cycle” is a vague timeframe since business \ncycles vary in length  and recessions are notoriously difficult to predict . Given that U.S. inflation  \nhas been below target for seven  years, would we need  or want  seven -plus years of inflation \nabove 2 percent?  At what point should bygones be  bygones?  \nFinally, t he Federal Reserve’s most recent Monetary Policy Report to Congress contained \na section on policy rules and systematic monetary policy.  It provided an example of a  price -level \ntargeting  rule that included the gap between the level of prices today and the level of prices that \nwould be observed if inflation had been a constant at 2 percent from a specified starting year  \n(1998) . The prescription from that rule would have been  to set the target funds rate at less than 1 \npercent at the end of last year. Of course, it is impossible to judge the counterfactual implications \nof maintaining the funds rate target at or below 1 percent throughout the recovery.  I think it is \n\n \n \n9 \n fair to assume , however, that the potential to generate real and financial imbalances  might be \nsubstantial , ultimately imposing a n even  higher cost to the economy than where we are today.  \n \nConclusions  \nThe econom y’s fundamentals are sound.  Downside risks are notable however as my \noutlook calls for growth to slow to trend, with moderating job gains and low inflation.  In these \ncircumstances, m onetary policy can take a wait -and-see approach.   \nOver the longer -run, with an evolving economy, prudent policymaking would suggest  \ntaking a look at our current policy strategies to see if they can be improved  or refined, especially \nin light of the possibility of a future return to the zero lower bound.  In doing so,  we must be \naware that what works in theory may have limitations and unintended consequences when \nadopted in practice.  The Federal Reserve will explore these issues as part of its review of its \nmonetary policy strategy, tools  and communications p ractices  this year."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 15, 2019  \nCentral Exchange  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed  by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n1 \n I’m delighted  to be back  with the Central  Exchange  for what  has become  something  of a \nNew  Year’s  tradition.   This year marks  another  rotation  for me into the role of a voting  member  \non the Federal  Reserve’s  Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC) —the body  that sets our nation’s  \nmonetary  policy.    \nAs you may know,  the FOMC  consists  of the governors  of the Federal  Reserve  Board , \nwho are nominated  by the president  and confirmed  by the Senate , and the presidents  of the 12 \nregional  Federal  Reserve  Banks , who are appointed  by their respective  Boards  of Directors  \nsubject  to the approval  of the Board  of Governors  in Washington.   Each  of the governors  and the \nregional  Fed presidents  participate  in all FOMC  meetings .  However , voting  rights  are rotated  \namong  the presidents  each year.  In contrast  to the governors  and the New  York  Fed president , \nwho each have  a permanent  vote on the FOMC,  the other  11 Fed presidents  share  four votes  on a \nrotating  basis.   This system  was designed  to ensure  that the publicly  appointed  governors  have  a \nmajority  of votes  on the Committee  unless  there  are vacancies  on the Board  of Governors.   As \npresident  of the Kansas  City Fed, I rotate  voting with the presidents  of the Minneapolis  and San \nFrancisco  Feds.    \nWith  that in mind,  my remarks  today  will focus  on the current  state of the economy  and, \nin that context,  how I’m thinking  about  the stance  of monetary  policy .   \nThe U.S. economy  is currently  enjoy ing one of its longest  expansions,  while  the Federal  \nReserve  has been  gradually  removing  a portion  of the massive  accommodation  it provided  \nbeginning  in 2008.   Short -term interest  rates  have  moved  up and the Fed’s  sizeable  balance  \nsheet , which  reached  $4.5 trillion  in late 2014,  has been  slowly  shrinking.   With  these  conditions  \nin play,  the question s currently  being  asked  are, “Where are we in the normalization  process?   \nDo we have  some  distance  to go to reach  a ‘norma l’ interest  rate or are we nearly  there ?”  \n\n \n2 \n These  questions  remind  me of road trips with my children .  Filled  with anticipation  to \nreach  the destination,  they would  ask, repeatedly,  “Are we there  yet, how much  longer ?” The \nanswer  was usually  a vague  response,  like “We’re getting  close .  Just look out the window.”      \nToday,  even  with GPS-like technology  to serve  as a guide , I find our policy  map is \nincomplete  and, therefore,  I cannot  give an exact  answer  to how close  we are to a neutral  setting  \nfor interest  rates.   There  remain s a host of factors  that can influence  its “location ,” and, as a \nconsequence , will affect  the journey  ahead .  The truth  is that a vague  “we’re  getting  close ” may \nbe the best response  I have  to offer .   \nLet me share  my thoughts  on where  we are and why this is the case, reminding  you that \nthe views I express  today  are my own.  \n \nA Look  at the U.S. Economy  and Where  We Are \n By most  measures,  the U.S. economy  is performing  well.   The unemployment  rate is near \na 50-year low, and inflatio n is stable  and well-anchored  near the Federal  Reserve’s  2 percent  \ntarget.   In addition,  real gross  domestic  product  (GDP )—our broadest  measure  of economic  \nactivity —is increasing  at a moderate  pace,  supported  by both consumer  spending  and business  \nfixed  investment.   Last year,  with accommodative  fiscal  and monetary  policies,  real GDP  grew  at \nan estimated  annual  rate of roughly  3 percent —somewhat  above  the economy’s  longer -run \ngrowth  potential,  which  is estimated  to be a bit below  2 percent.    \nLooking  ahead,  I would  expect  to see a somewhat  slower  rate of growth,  closer  to but \nperhaps  still a bit above,  the economy’s  longer -run growth  potential.   While  we have  begun  to \nsee some  slowing  in interest -sensitive  sectors  such as housing  and motor  vehicles,  consider able \nunderlying  momentum  remains  and should  serve  to sustain  the expansion.   For example,  \n\n \n3 \n business  and consumer  confidence  are both near post-recession  highs.   Wages  are rising  at a \nroughly  3 percent  annual  rate, up from  2½ percent  a year ago.  Manufacturi ng activity  has \nrecovered  from  a slowdown  in 2015 -16 and is now expanding  at a solid  pace.  And,  employment  \ncontinues  to grow  at a rate that is faster  than required  to absorb  new entrants  into the job market.  \nAlongside  these  favorable  outcomes,  there  are of course  factors  that will affect  this \nperformance  and pose risks  to the outlook.   On the upside,  growth  above  the economy’s  longer -\nrun potential  could  further  stretch  labor  markets,  leading  to wage  gains  that are out of line with \nproductivity  growth.  As these  wage  gains  begin  to shrink  profit  margins,  firms  may pass higher  \nlabor  costs  on to their customers  causing  inflation  to rise.  According  to standard  economic  \ntheory,  there  is a level  of unemployment —calle d the natural  rate of unemployment —at which  \ninflation  neither  rises nor falls.   When  the unemployment  rate falls below  the natural  rate, \ninflation  tends  to rise.  There  is a lot of uncertainty  about  where  the natural  rate is, but current  \nestimates  place  it around  4½ percent.   Thus,  with the unemployment  rate at 3.9 percent  in \nDecember  and expected  to fall further,  it is possible  that we could  be on the cusp of an \nundesirable  increase  in inflation.    \nOn the downside,  financial  market  conditions  have  tightened  and become  more  volatile.   \nThe foreign  exchange  value  of the dollar  has appreciated,  contributing  to a loss of \ncompetitiveness  of our exports  and potentially  a softening  of inflation  below  our 2 percent  \nobjective.   Credit  spreads  have  widened,  making  capital  investment  costlier.   Uncertainty  about  \ntrade  policy  and global  economic  growth  has increased,  possibly  causing  businesses  to postpone  \nor rethink  capital  spending  projects.   In my travels  aroun d the seven  states  of the Tenth Federal  \nReserve  District,  I increasingly  hear that input  costs  are rising,  qualified  workers  are hard to find \n\n \n4 \n and retain,  pricing  power  is limited,  and that firms  are pulling  back  rather  than passing  higher  \ncosts  on to their customers.    \nTwo sectors  of particular  importance  to our region  have  their own unique  set of \nchallenges.  The farm  sector  is in a prolonged  downturn  as a result  of declining  agricultural  \nprices,  made  worse  by retaliatory  tariffs  on U.S. farm  products.   And the oil and gas sector  is \nfacing  another  sharp  decline  in oil prices.   While  this sector  has expanded  dramatically  since  the \nearly  2000s  thanks  to fracking  and the related  shale  oil revolution,  sharp  oil price  fluctuations  \nhave  led to a boom -and-bust cycle that may be repeating  itself.     \n To summarize,  labor  markets  are tight,  inflation  is low and stable,  and economic  growth  \nis expected  to slow  to a rate close  to the economy’s  longer -run growth  potential.   \nNotwithstanding  both upside  and downside  risks,  the outlook  for the economy  appears  favorable.      \n \nImplications  for monetary  policy  \nWith  this background,  let me turn to the matter  of monetary  policy.   Since  the beginning  \nof the interest  rate normalization  process  in December  2015,  the Federal  Reserve  has raised  rates  \n225 basis  points,  removing  much  of the policy  accommodation  that was put in place  during  the \nfinancial  crisis  and Great  Recession.   \nSo, are we there  yet?  Has the FOMC  raised  rates  back  to a neutral  or normal  level  so that \nthey are no longer  either  stimulating  or restraining  economic  activity?   Have  we reached  the \nproverbial  soft landing  where  the economy  has achieved  maximum  employment,  stable  prices,  \ngrowth  at potential,  and monetary  policy  neutrality?  In my view,  we are not there  just yet.  \nHowever,  we are close  and for now,  it seems  to me that we should  proceed  with cautio n and be \npatient  as we approach  our destination.  \n\n \n5 \n   As the year unfolds , I will be looking  for signals  from  the economy  in a number  of areas  \nthat will determine  my policy  choices.   My position  on whether  to further  increase  rates  or stay \nwhere  we currently  are will depend  on several  factors.   If, for example,  the inflation  outlook  \nremains  benign  despite  tight labor markets  or if the downside  risks  I spoke  of earlier  materia lize, \nwe can pause  the normalization  process.   On the other  hand , if inflation  pressures  emerge , it \nwould  suggest  we are further  away  from  neutral  than we may have  previously  thought  and \nfurther  interest  rate increases  could  be necessary .   \nIn judging  future economic  conditions , I am mindful  that the effects  of past policy  actions  \nhave  not yet fully  played  out, calling  for patience  in considering  our policy  actions .  As the \nfamous  economist  Milton  Friedman  observed,  monetary  policy  acts with “long  and varia ble \nlags.”   Typically,  policy  moves  affect  real economic  activity  with a lag of six months  to a year \nand inflation  in one to two years.   Given  the cumulative  225 basis  points  of tightening —100 \nbasis  points  of which  occurred  last year—we have  likely  not yet seen the full effect  of higher  \nrates  on real economic  activity  or inflation.   A pause  in the normalization  process  would  give us \ntime to assess  if the economy  is responding  as expected  with a slowing  of growth  to a pace that \nis sustainable  over the longer  run.  Failure  to recognize  these  lags could  lead to an over-\ntightening  of policy,  a downturn  in economic  growth  and an undershooting  of our inflation  \nobjective.  \nThese  issues  are made  all the more  difficult  by a fact that I mentioned  earlier  in my \nremarks —the map guiding  us is incomplete.   We do not know  precisely  the location  of our \ndestination:  that is, the longer -run neutral  value  of the federal  funds  rate.  Recall  that the neutral  \nrate is the rate that neither  stimulates  economic  activity  nor restrains  it.  Participants  at last \nmonth’s  FOMC  meeting  gave  a range  of estimates  of the longer -run federal  funds  rate from  2½ \n\n \n6 \n percent  to 3½ percent  with a median  of 2.8 percent.   With  the funds  rate target  currently  at 2¼ to \n2½ percent,  we are near the lower  end of the range  of our estimates  of neutral .  And complicating  \nour reliance  on these  estimates  is that, in the background,  we are gradually  reducing  the size of \nour balance  sheet,  allowing  assets  to roll off as they mature .  It is unclear  whether,  or how much,  \nthis roll off is further  removing  accommodation.  Again,  this sugg ests it might  be a good  time to \npause  our interest  rate normalization , study  the incoming  evidence  and data, and verify  our \ncurrent  location.    \nA final reason  to show  patience  around  further  rate adjustments  is that a number  of key \neconomic  relationships  that have  guided  policy  over the years  may have  broken  down  in the \naftermath  of the financial  crisis  and Great  Recession.   Structural  changes  in the economy  such as \nthe aging  of the populatio n, sluggish  productivity  growth,  business  sector  consolidation,  rising  \ngovernment  deficits  and debt,  and historically  low interest  rates  have  potentially  rendered  past \nguideposts  to policy  less reliable.   In addition,  central  banks  in other  parts  of the world, like the \nFederal  Reserve,  undertook  massive  asset  purchase  programs  to address  the financial  crisis,  and \nare now beginning  to confront  the need  to shrink  their balance  sheets.   These  central  bank  \ninterventions  may be changing  the structure  of financia l markets  in unknown  and unpredictable  \nways.  \nOne relationship,  for example,  that has confounded  economists  and policymakers  over \nthe past several  years  is that of inflation  and economic  slack.   As mentioned  earlier,  when  the \nunemployment  rate falls below  its natural  rate, we generally  expect  inflation  to rise.  But despite  \nunemployment  falling  well below  most  estimates  of the natural  rate, inflation  has remained  \nsubdued.   This raises  questions  about  whether  our estimate  of the natural  rate is too pessimisti c \nand whether  the economy  can operate  at a lower  unemployment  rate today  than in the past \n\n \n7 \n without  sparking  inflationary  pressures.   This is another  area where  I will be looking  for \nfeedback  from  the economy  to assess  whether  we might  need  to revise  our estimates  of the \nnatural  rate. \nTo this mix, I would  add any number  of additional  real and financial  market  indicators  to \nmonitor  closely  for evidence  that monetary  policy  is approaching  neutral  and that the pace of \nnormalization  should  change.   Gauging  the appropriate  policy  response  will also importantly  be \nshaped  by analysis  from  my staff and input  from  a wide  range  of contacts  who have  on-the-\nground  knowledge  of financial  conditions,  price  pressures,  and the outlook  for economic  activity.    \n \nConclusion  \nEarlier in the normalization  process,  the FOMC  provided  forward  guidance  suggesting  \nthat monetary  policy  was accommodative  and that gradual  interest  rate increases  would  be \nconsistent  with achieving  our goals.   Given  current  economic  conditions,  providing  such explicit  \nguidance  now about  the future  path of policy  rates  would  not be appropriate  in my view.   \nBack  then,  policy  was some  distance  from  a neutral  setting  and we had not fully  realized  \nour objectives  for employment  and inflation,  and thus the direction  of policy  was clear.   Today,  \ncircumstances  are different.   While  my policy  view  always  depends  on the flow of data,  this year \nwe must  acknowledge  that rates are approaching,  and may be closing  in on, our destination  of \nneutral.    We should  also remain  sharply aware  that the effects  of past rate increases,  while  \ndissipating,  are still in play and the effects  will need  to be watched  carefully.    \nIt is possible  that some  additional  rate increases  will be appropriate .  But making  that \njudgment  is not urgent  and should  depend  on a careful  look at the data and gathering  additional  \n\n \n8 \n insight  into where  our destination  is, how much  further  we need  to go to reach  it and how \nquickly  we should  get there ."
