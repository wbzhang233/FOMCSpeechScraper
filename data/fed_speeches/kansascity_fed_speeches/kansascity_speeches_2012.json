This has certainly been a challenging period for bank supervisors  who took a \nvariety of ad hoc steps during the crisis to deal with troubled institutions and markets , worked to \nmaintain core financial services  and public confidence , and are now  issuing and  implementing a \nlong list of reforms .  \nDespite these well -intentioned  efforts, we should consider whether  the regulatory reforms  \nreflect an effective  response to the issues that surfaced in the recent financial crisis.  Further, we \nshould look to lessons from the past to understand to what extent the approaches used during the \nfinancial crisis may at least partially explain why many countries around the world  are \nexperiencing an economic recovery that has been agonizingly slow.  \nTo illustrate this p oint, I will first look at the policy approaches taken in previous cris is \nperiods  and examine what worked best and what did not. Then I will compare  the response to the \nrecent financial collapse with successful approaches  from the past.  Finally, I will dis cuss my \nview that t here are policy shortcomings that still need to be addressed and ways that we can  \nprovide for a stronger recovery.  \n \nLessons from Previous Crises  \n  As the side effects of the 2008 crisis ha ve lingered and turned into a very slow recovery \nprocess, several reasons  have been given as possible explanations for this  experience . One idea, \nfor example, is  that financial crises are unique  and it takes much longer to recover from them \nthan other econom ic downturns.  Similarly, some contend  that asset price bubble s produce a \n“balance sheet recession .” As a result, people  must  first try to pay down debt and increase \n\n2 \n savings, thus leaving monetary policy and low interest rates less effective in encouraging \nborrowing and expansion.  Another contention is that banks must first work off their bad assets \nand restore capital before they are in position to help promote a recovery.   \n  While all of these carry some truth, we have had major  financial crises in the pas t. In a \nnumber of  cases, the outcomes have been better, setting the stage for relati vely faster recoveries \nwhile also limiting any moral hazard problems that might be carried forward . \n \nUnited States, Sweden and Japan  \n  What the United States did to address  the banking panic  of the 1930s  became the model \nfor much of what was done in Sweden and eventually in Japan.  The banking crisis of the 1930s \nwas the most severe in U.S. history , with the total number of commercial banks declining by \n9,000 , or nearly 40 pe rcent, from the beginning of 1930 to the end of 1933.  About 4,000 banks \nfailed in 1933 alone.  \n  After a one -week banking holiday was declared in March 1933, the Reconstruction \nFinance Corporation (RFC), which was a public entity established in the 1930s to  provide \nsupport to ailing banks and businesses , joined with the banking authorities to quickly assess the \ncondition of every U .S. bank . Each bank was then placed into one of  three categories.  The first  \ncategory included  sound banks that were generally thought to have adequate capital.  A second \ngroup included banks that had lost most of their capital but still had the resources and ability to \nprotect depositors  and remain  viable , and a third group consisted of failing  banks that had lost all \nof their cap ital and would not be able to pay off their depositors in full.  Notably, i n making these \nevaluations, the RFC established a policy that every  bad asset in a bank must  first be written \ndown to its realistic economic value.  \n\n3 \n   The banks in the first group were then reopened promptly after the bank holiday, and \nbanks in the second group were reopened after raising new capital privately or by se lling \npreferred stock to the RFC.  Banks in the third category were placed into conserva torships.  The \nRFC also insisted that any needed changes be made in a bank’s management before RFC funds \nwere injected.  \n  Overall, the RFC was highly successful in promptly restructuring, recapitalizing and \nrestoring public confidence in a U .S. banking syst em that had been in a sharp downward spiral.  \nNearly all of the RFC funds were eventually repaid with virtually no loss to taxpa yers.  Also, the \nRFC’s insistence  that bad assets be written  down to realistic values and poor management be \nreplaced helped to minimiz e moral hazard issues.  The economy continued to remain weak  in the \nyears after 1933 due to a variety of factors, such as the substantial disruption in financial \nintermediation from bank failures, zero interest rates and extreme caution on the part of \nbusinesses to expand their operations by  making new investments and hiring new workers.  \nDespite the soft recovery,  the banking sector  encountered few problems after 1933.  \n   In Sweden, a speculative boom in real estate and bank credit , along with unsustainable \nexchange rate policies,  led to a severe economic downturn and banking crisis  in the early 1990s . \nActions by Swedish authorities closely followed what the RFC did in the  United States.  Swedish \nbanks were classified into three categories that w ere patterned after the RFC approach . This \nanalysis led to a governmental takeover of two of Sweden’s six largest banks, with a third bank \nneeding to raise additional capital.  To restore confidence during the crisis, the Swedish \ngovernment instituted tempo rary guarantees for bank depositors and creditors but left \nstockholders at risk.  \n\n4 \n   One additional element employed in Sweden was the  use of asset management \ncorporations to acquire and resolve the bad assets of the two banks that were taken over . Thus, \ntwo healthy bank ing operations  were  returned to private ownership without significant delay.  As \na result of these steps and a strong economic recovery, the Swedish banking crisis was resolved \nmore quickly than generally expected and at little or no cost to ta xpayers.  \n  In contrast to Sweden, Japan ese authorities  were slow to address the ban king problems \nthat arose after Japan’s  real estate crash in the early 1990s.  Japanese banks became swamped \nwith substantial volumes of bad assets and had little real capital  to support their operations.  As a \nresult , Japan suffered through a series of severe credit crunches for muc h of the 1990s —the so - \ncalled “Lost Decade .” \n  Japan ese authorities  finally took action beginning in 1998 to deal with bank insolvency \nissues and to inject capital into the remainder of the banking system, using the RFC model as a \nguide for these actions.  These capital injections largely ended the credit crunch and were l ater \npaid back with out loss to taxpayer s. \n  A final example  is the thrift crisis in the United States in the 1980s.  This crisis arose from \nthrift institutions holding 30 -year, fixed -rate mortgage loans during a period of rapidly rising \ninterest rates in th e early 1980s.  As market rates jumped well above the contractual rates on \nmany of these loans, a significant number of thrifts were faced with both funding and insolvency \nissues.  However, there was little public commitment  to deal with these issues, given an \ninadequate amount in the thrift insurance fund and little support in Congress for allocating \nmoney to clean up the industry.   \n  Unfortunately, t he primary  response was to give thrifts a wider range of powers in the \nhope of  provid ing a new way out of the ir problems while allowing them to continue operating on \n\n5 \n little, if any, capital base.  This framework led to serious moral hazard issues and a surge in \ncommercial real estate lending by problem thrifts . By the end of the 1980s, a greatly expanded  \nfederal b ailout was needed for  the thrift  industry . \n  The lessons from these previous financial crises are clear.  First, the quickest way to \nrestore prosperity and financial stability is to identify the losses in the financial system and take \ntimely and concerted action to address them.  A guiding rule for supervisors should be that o nce a \nloss in the financial system is incurred, it will not go away on its own and will only delay the \nchances for recovery  and increase the eventual costs . \n  Second, supervisors must b e in a position to identify whic h institutions are viable and \ncapable of surviving a crisis . Supervisors also  need to determine  which institutions  are insolvent  \nand must be  resolved while providing a  chance to  bring them  back to private ownership under  \nnew and more capable management.  \n  Third, moral hazard issues must be considered in the steps take n. Whenever possible , \nregulators should  pursue actions that force the responsible parties to take losses and minimize \nfuture problems.  \n \nRecovering from the R ecent Crisis  \n  Faced with uncertain ty and urgency,  the United States and many other countries did not \nturn to  these lessons or the  crisis resolution model that was used in the United States in the 1930s \nand later adopted in Sweden and eventually in Japan.  In the United States, for instance, public \nauthorities provided significant liquidity assistance and debt guarantees  during the recent \nfinancial crisis , but did  little to pursue corrective measures when granting this assistance.  \n\n6 \n   For example, t he Troubled  Asset Relief Program (TARP), which was used to inject \npublic capital into U .S. banks, did not follow  the key principles that were used by the RFC in \n1930s to strengthen banks and avoid moral hazard problems.  Unlike the RFC, TARP injected \nfunds indiscriminately into all the major U .S. banks . No attempt was made to  put these banks \ninto different categories based on their condition and viability . Neither were they required to first \nwrite down their problem assets  to gain a perspective into capital needs  and to  force a balance \nsheet cleanup  and minimize  moral hazard concerns.  Equally important, there was no effort to \nassess the quality of management and to insist on changes when needed.  Instead,  attention and \nrestrictions were tied to limiting executive compensation and bonuses after the fact and not to the \nmore critical question of management  capability .  \n  Perhaps one could ar gue that the 2008 crisis was different and did  not lend itself well to \nthe type of actions taken in previous crises.  For example, many claim that today’s financial \ninstruments  are less transparent and are harder to evaluate and price.  Another factor may be the \nsystemic nature of many of the institutio ns involved in this crisis and the global nature of the \ncrisis itself.  \n  These and other characteristics  certainly merit consideration . However , the slow nature of \nthis recovery, the limited amount of new lending after more than four years  and the continuation \nof banking issues  in some countries may suggest that the actions we took left unresolved \nproblems.  In addition, we must consider whether what we are doing is sustainable in the long run \nor whether it only increase s the chance of  futur e crises.   \n  We should first ask ourselves if we have corrected the misaligned incentiv es that were \nbehind this crisis.  Quite clearly, a major issue in the United States and many other countries \nduring the crisis was the public assistance and protection that was given to banks deemed “too \n\n7 \n big to fail.”  We cannot expect to have a sound financial system if the key players in it are not \nheld fully responsible for the choices they make.  \n  The traditional safety nets in most countries already provide incentives for added risk -\ntaking that we all attempt to address, albeit imperfectly, through regulation  and supervision . \nAdding too -big-to-fail protections into our safety nets not only further distorts these risk-taking \nincentives but also puts a much greater degree of pressure on the supervisory framework.  \nEnhanced supervision and the related steps many of us are taking now are unlikely to work well \nas long as major institutions still have incentives to take on added risk.  \n  Another incentive  problem  we should think about is the Basel risk weights.  Regulators \nhave spent a great deal of effort trying to construct a quantitativ e system for linking capital needs \nto risk levels.  Yet the financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that mortgage loans, mortgage -\nbacked securities and sovereign debt were  not the low -risk assets as designated under the Basel \nstandards.  We have also seen that institutions have a remarkable ability to circumvent  standards \nas long as they have an incentive to do so . \n  Regulatory capital measures undoubtedly gave us a misleading picture during the crisis —\nin part because we were reluctant to require that bank holdings be written down to their actual \nvalues, but also because these capital measures failed to  pick up the steep decline in capital that \nbecame evident in  market capitalization  figures  and other market -based measures of capital.  To \nme, all these issues imply that we must have a strong leverage constraint to counteract any \nshortcomings that may exist in risk-based capital standards .  \n  Along with strong leverage ratios, we must have the correct supervisory focus , \nparticularly since  we have not carefully followed some of the lessons of previous crises . For \ninstance, d o we still need to clean up the banks and insist on better management?  In previous \n\n8 \n crises, the first step to a successful recovery was to  admit that some banks had faile d and could \nonly be brought back to life with better management and a clean balance sheet.  \n  With regard to other aspects of supervisory focus , I am especially concerned that we may \nforget the importance of our traditional supervisory tools —microprudential supervision, careful \nexaminer assessments of credit and other banking risks and our evaluations of the quality of bank \nmanagement . Today we are focused on enhanced supervision of the systemically important \nfinancial institutions, stress tes ts, macroprudential supervision  and many other reforms . These \nsteps will not get us very far if we don’t first address the incentive problem s in our financial \ninstitutions , insist on better  bank management  wherever needed and emphasize our traditional \nsupervisory framework.  \n  Enhanced supervision and stress tests, for instance, are likely to draw many resources \naway from traditional supervision.  While the se new supervisory tools have been  useful exercises, \nin the end they may become little more than rou tine, repetitive steps  in satisfying regulatory \nrequirements —much like the Basel risk weights —without contributing to a more effective \nsupervisory process.  \n  \nConclu sion \n  It is said that regulators come in after the battle is over and shoot the wounded.  In this \ncase, many issues remain as we seek to put our respective economies in position for a strong \nrecovery and a more resilient financial system.  I believe we must first  identify and  correct  the \nshortcomings discovered in this crisis.  Previous crises pr ovide an excellent guide  of what works \nwell in re -establishing a strong banking system , as well as what does not work.  Because  each \n\n9 \n crisis is different, we must diagnosis carefully  the risks and outcomes within our financial system \nas a foundation for a stronger economic recovery."

George  \nPresident and CEO  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2012 Community Banking Conference  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \nNovember 2, 2012  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n Introduction  \nCommunity banks are a n important part of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s \nregional economy , and we have significant supervisory responsibilities  for those banks and  their \nholding compa nies. Certainly, we recognize the challenges facing community banks  today . In \nfact, some have question ed whether community banks will be able to effectively compete going \nforward . Others remain optimistic and continue to see opportunities for the community bank \nmodel , as discussed this morning .  \nWithout question, t he recent financial cris is and slow economic recovery are now \nfocusing much attention on the banking industry and its regulatory framework.  In particular, the \nDodd -Frank Act and the proposed Basel III capital rules are bringing major changes to the \nregulatory structure . These include  the new Financial Stability Oversight Council and Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, enhanced supervision and orderly liquidation authority for \nsystemically important organizations, a new regulatory regime for the capital markets and \nfinancial i nfrastructure, and higher and more complex capital requirements . \nUnderstandably, w e often hear from community bankers that they do not expect this \nchanging environment to work  well for them . These bankers  anticipate  being hit with  significant \nregulatory costs  for a crisis that originated in other parts of the financial system . I have similar \nconcerns about the current direction of regulatory policy and how it may negatively affect the \nability of commun ity banks  to be competitive  and serve the credit needs of their communities . \nToday I will discuss my concerns and the importance of ensuring a more equitable landscape for \ncommunity banks.   \n  \n \n \n\n2 \n Previous Challenges  for Community Banks  \nI should begin by acknowledging that community bankers are no strangers to a \nchallenging operating environment.  Over the past few decades, c ommunity banks have \nencountered many challenges and developments that were often thought to favor larger \ninstitutions and threaten the future of community bank s. Some of you here today experienced  \nthose challenges . \nWhen I started at the Federal Reserve  in 1982 , bank expansion laws  were viewed as a \nserious threat . In many parts of our District, we still had a unit banking structure in which banks \ncould only operate o ut of a single office or perhaps with a few  additional limited -service  \nfacilities . Several  District states also did not allow multibank holding companies, and interstate \nbanking was nonexistent  outside of a few special exceptions . \nWhen efforts were begun to relax these expansion restrictions, a common assertion was \nthat larger, expansion -minded institutions would invade  community bank  market s and steal their \nbusiness . We often heard t hat “Multibank holding companies would be the death of  the \ncommunity bank.”  As it happened , the liberalization of bank expansion laws still left many \ncommunity banks in operation , albeit with some reduction in the ir number s and overall share of \nindustry assets.  Many well -managed community banks have been able  to capitalize on this new \nexpansion framework by making acquisitions of their own and spreading their skills over a large r \nbase of operations.  In fact, about  60 percent of bank mergers since 1985 have involved one \ncommunity banking organization acquiring another one.  \nSimilarly, w hen deposit interest rate ceilings were removed in the 1980s , community \nbankers were concerned that larger  banks would be able and wi lling to pay more for deposits \nthan community banks —an outcome many claimed would pull  deposit s out of  community banks \n\n3 \n and destroy  their net interest margins.  Technological change was also thought to favor large \nbanks because they had the resources to be on the cutting edge of such developments as ATM \nnetworks, online banking, automation of banking operat ions, new financial instruments  and risk -\nmanagement models . Finally, community banks have seen c ertain lending and product markets \nshift to larger institutions , captive finance companies , credit unions  and the capital markets.  \nAmong these shifts  have been  credit card  lending , auto loans, equipment lending  and the \ndominant role community banks once had as the principal repository for their customer s’ \nsavings . \nIn all of these cases, community banks have established an innovat ive track record, \nwhether it is an increased ability to manage funding needs by paying competitive deposit  rates , \ndevelop their own expertise in technology and find vendors to provide other services , or discover \nnew services to provide to customers . To be sure, the community bank  business model has \nproven resilient and able to withstand significant challenges when bo ards of directors and their \nmanagement teams demand strong performance and are willing to be flexible and ready to \ncapitalize on new opportunities.  \n \nWhat Characteristics Allow Community Banks to Survive and Pro sper?  \nUnderstanding how community banks successfully overcame these challenges is \nimportant, especially as we consider the direction of today’s financial reforms. I’d like to \nhighlight a couple of studies we’ve done to analyze this.  \nFirst, community banks generally operate with t he right incenti ves and a n effective  \ncorporate governance structure . Many community banks are closely held institutions with the top \nmanage ment  and board members having significant ownership positions.  These ownership \n\n4 \n incentives help to ensure that key policymakers are committed to achieving good performance, \nhave enough a t stake to avoid excessive risk -taking, and also have a vested interest in the health \nof their communities.  This is well understood by community bankers , and it stands in sharp \ncontrast to some of the governance problems apparent at larger banks , especially during the \ncrisis.  Few outside of the community banking sector, though, fully understand the significance \nand implications of this governance structure.  \nThe s taff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has conducted several studies o n \nthe ownership and management structure of community banks .1 We found  that the better \nperforming and safer community banks are those where the major policymakers ha ve much to \nlose if they d o not  make the right decisions.  This concl usion  is significant when we consider  how \ncommunity banks should be supervised compared to larger banking organizations.  \nAnother commonly noted  strength of community banks is that they have close \nrelationships with and detailed knowledge of their customers.  As a general practice,  community \nbanks do  not make “cookie -cutter” loans  and do not offer the same standardized products  as \nlarger banks , but instead tailor their services to the needs  of their customers.  \nWhile  many now claim that the value of customer relationships is declining with credit \nscoring and credit risk models, a recent study at our Bank found that there is real value in \nrelationship  lending and in the soft personal information on customers that community bankers \ntypically have.   \nThis study looked at a large sample of Small Business Administration  loans made by \ncommunity banks  to new businesses and to other businesses with blemished credit records . \n                                                           \n1 Robert DeYoung, Kenneth Spong, Richard J. Sullivan, “Who’s minding the store? Motivating and monitoring hired \nmanagers at small, closely held commercial banks,” Journal of Banking and Finance , July 2001, pp. 1209 -1243; and \nRichard J. Sullivan and Kenneth R. Spong, “Manager wealth concentration, ownership structure, and risk in \ncommercial banks,” Journal of Financial Intermediation , April 2007, pp. 229 -248.  \n\n5 \n Given the inherent risk in such loans , one might expect that having a good personal knowledge \nof these customers would be useful . Not surprisingly, the study found  that default rates on these \nloans were indeed lower when the lending was to businesses  located in the same market as the  \nbank . Defaults were higher  when the borrowers were in a different  market where the bank would \nnot be expected to have the same type of  close personal relationship s with th ese borrower s. \nFurthe rmore , the lowest default rates were in smaller communities where local  banker s \ntypically have lifelong knowledge of their customer s and the closest personal relationships.  This \nresearch suggests that community banks fulfill a very important function in es tablishing close \nrelationships and directing credit to customers whose needs might otherwise go unserved . This \nevidence suggests that policymakers must understand the business model dynamics and \nincentives for banks of all sizes  and must carefully consider the implications of new reg ulation, \nits cost and benefit, and its unintended consequences.  \n  \nA More Equitable and Rational Path for Community Banks  \nGoing forward , community bankers  will be challenged once again to find way s to be \nsuccessful in a  difficult environment, ranging from a n economy that is growing slow ly amid  an \ninterest rate environment that is not especially  conducive to good banking , to a complex and \nburdensome regulatory regime . I will focus my remarks on the latter.  \nThe challenges of regulatory compliance have long ranked among c ommunity bankers ’ \ntop concerns.  And you and I both know that the industry and regulators view risk differently.  For \nexample, in 2006, the banking regulators issued interagency guidance  regarding commercial real \nestate concentrations.  Prior to issuing this guidance, w e received thousands of letters from the \nindustry and members of Cong ress question ing the guidance and causing regulators to back \n\n6 \n away.  As it turned out, some bankers would have been well served to heed this warning.  So, we \nbelieve supervision and regulation can and should play an important role . That said, h aving been \ninvolved in community bank supervision for 30 years, today’s regulatory issues , in my view , \nhave different i mplications .  \nAs you are well aware, m uch of the new regulation is a reaction  to the shortcomings and \nproblems at large banks and within capital markets that contributed to this crisis . Their business \nmodel and related activities and practices , combined with lax supervision , have been well \ndocumented.   The result is a  new regulatory environment  that is substantially at odds with how \ncommunit y banks actually operate.  \nFor example, r esidential mortgage lending is likely to become much more complica ted \ndespite the focus on simplifying disclosures.  This complexity includes new provisions defining \nqualified mortgage loans, requirements regarding a borrower’s ability to repay the loan, risk -\nretention standards, and an array of risk weights under Basel III based on standard mortgage \nlending terms.  In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be rewriting many of \nthe key regulations related to mortgage lending.  \nThis approach of specifying how residential mortgage loans should be structured and \nunderwritten will undoubtedly leave community bankers with far less flexibility and authority to \ntailor such lending to the characteristics of their communities  and customers.  Because of this , it \nis not uncommon to hear commu nity bankers say that th ey may be  force d to cut back \nsubstantially on their home lending activities or even eliminate them entirely.  Such unintended \nconsequences are costly and impede mortgage lending at a time when housing markets are weak.  \nNew capital ru les, known as Basel III , contain  a variety of features that could have a \nsignificant effect on community banks if they are adopted as originally proposed.  I know this \n\n7 \n because I read all 1,000 pages of the draft rule. Some of these include higher and more complex \nrisk weights for selected types of loans and securities, inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on \ncertain debt securities in regulatory capital calculations, the treatmen t of trust preferred securities  \nand additional capital dedu ctions of mortgage servicing assets . \nTo be clear,  I absolutely support efforts to increase the level of capital in our largest \nbanks and improve the quality of this capital,  but I find many of these rules to be costly for \ncommunity banks and of little publ ic benefit  for this part of the industry . Risk weights based on \nstandardized lending terms, for instance, completely ignore the data I referenced earlier —that \nlending relationships and personal information are of substantial value to community banks in \ncontrolling credit risks.  Nor do the higher, more complex risk weights , as well as  the restrictive \nprovisions of Dodd -Frank , accurately reflect the low loss rates that community banks typically \nexperienced on the ir residential mortgage lending and small bu siness  lending  during the crisis . In \naddition, Basel III will almost certainly lead to greater fluctuations in regulatory capital levels at \ncommunity banks even though the underlying assets and risks may not have changed much.  \nFurthermore , we should not forget that  the proposed Basel III rules are designed to be a \nthree -pillar approach, linking capital requirements with supervision and market discipline . \nUnfortunately,  I think  the complexity embedded in the proposed capital requirements fai ls to \nacknowledge that supervisory and market assessments of a bank’s capital are critical factors in \njudging capital adequacy.  In my experience, t he supervision of community banks clearly \nprovides a more refined measure of risk than can be achieve d with o ne-dimensional , static  risk \nweights . And, b ased on the performance of risk weights in the recent crisis, I support efforts to \nstrengthen our supervisory regime for large banking institutions to balance the assessment of risk \nbeyond quantitative measures of  capital.   \n\n8 \n We should also acknowl edge that market discipline plays an important role in community \nbanks.  As our studies have shown, the ownership and management structure of community banks \nprovide s important incentives , as does a strong  corporate governance framework . In the end, \ncommunity bankers know  they are not “too big to fail” and must manage their operations and \nrisk exposures accordingly . \nOverall, the  strength of  the community banking model should tell us that a regulatory \nformat aimed at the largest banking organ izations and the recent crisis is not likely to be a good \nfit for community banks.  Some have advocated for a different regulatory framework for \ncommunity  banks to recognize the difference in business models of large and small banks.  At \nbest, though, this strikes me as only a partial fix.  Until we address the incentive problems and \n“too big to fail” status of our largest financial institutions , the entire financial sector —indeed the \nentire economy —will be vulnerable to future crises.  For that reason, I would argue that we must \nalso take steps to ensure that the largest institutions operate under a framework that encourages \nsafe and sound banking and allows for failure of mismanaged risk.  \n \nConclusion  \nIn closing, h istory has shown that w ell-managed and innovative community banks are \nwell position ed to handle  the challenges of the future and to take advantage of  new opportunities.  \nThe new regulatory challenges,  though, may be a different type of battle.  I have been involved in \ndiscussions to encourage r egulators to take steps to ensure that commun ity banks are not put at a \ndisadvantage by laws and rules  meant to fix problems that do not exist in community banks . This \nReserve Bank is fully committed to this objective , and I encourage all of you to sh are your \nthoughts with us and with other regulatory agenc ies at every opportunity."

Over the past few years, \nsignificant policy reforms have been adopted in many countries in an attempt to address \nproblems that arose during the financial crisis  and that in many respects  continue to plague our \nfinancial systems . As financial supervisors, we are now in the process of deciding how to \nimplement the new  reforms , while also thinking about  what else should be done. \nI am pleased  to see this confer ence focus on the challenges we now face in supervising \nfinancial institutions and  in creating a more resilient and stable financial system —both \ndomestically and globally.  In fact, the organizers of the conference have structur ed this important \npolicy debate around the  key questions  that we should be asking ourselves.  Among these are:  \nWhat policy tools will be effective, which tools will function as intended, are ther e alternative \nsteps we should consider, and what reforms might remain “ works in progress ” for the \nforeseeable future?  \nFollowing the theme of this conference, I will provide a high -level context for  the steps \ntaken in the United States to  address the financial crisis —many of which mirror actions being \ntaken around the world or by inter national authorities . Then I will offer my own views on \nwhether  these policy steps can be expected to contribute to a more stable financial system while \naddress ing what went wrong in th e crisis.  \n \nFinancial Crisis and Reform in the United States  \nThe financial crisis in the United States was unique in the sense that it was one of the \nmore severe crises in U .S. and global history . It also involved a deep and widespread collapse in \nthe housing sector that had never occurred before in our  country, except perhaps during the \n\n \n2 \n 1930s. The cost of this crisis ha s been exceedingly large and continues  to grow. From the \nstandpoint of direct costs, the conservatorships of Fannie M ae and Freddie Mac—our  two main \ngovernment sponsored enterprises for h ousing —have so far cost taxpayers $187 billion. The \nestimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from failures of depository institutions between \n2008 and 2011 have been more than  $85 billion, and federal authorities provided more than  $245 \nbillion in capital support to depository institutions through the Troubled Asset Relief Program \n(TARP)—all  but $10 billion of which has been paid back with interest and fees.  \nThese direct costs, though, are just the tip of the iceberg.  The crisis led  to a reduction in \nhome equity in the United States of nearly $7 trillion.  The International Monetary Fund \nestimated that the crisis could result in write  downs of loans and securities in U .S. banks of as \nmuch as $1 trillion. Among other costs related to t he crisis, the fiscal stimulus authorized by our \nfederal government in 2008 and 2009 totaled more than $1 tri llion, and we have also suffered \nfrom large federal de ficits, protracted unemployment  and slow economic growth. Finally, the \ncombination of massive  public assistance and outsized executive compensation has created \nwidespread mistrust and anger directed at large financial  institutions, their regulators  and \ngovernment officials. \nAll of these costs justifiably created substantial pressure for major  reform of our financial \nregulatory system.  Much has been written about the crisis and its spread on a global basis, so I \nwill turn to the key  reforms we are adopting in the United States as  we try to  enhance \nsupervisory focus and create a stronger  financi al system.  \nTwo years ago, the U.S. enacted t he Dodd- Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act  in the hope of bringing greater stability to its financial system.  This act has many  \ncomponents  and introduces a  macroprudential perspective  by creati ng the Financial Stability \n\n \n3 \n Oversight Council. This Council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury Department, with \nnine other voting members drawn largely from the federal financial regulatory agencies and five \nnonvoting members. A major responsibilit y of the Council is to identify and monitor emerging \nrisks or regulatory gaps that might threaten financial stability and to make recommendations for corrective action.  The Council issued its first annual report on financial stability in 2011, and \nanother report was issued in July of this year. These reports have provided a starting point, but there is still much to be done with regard to the very challenging task of  monitoring financial \ntrends and threats to stability  and developing timely and effective responses.  \nThe Council is also charged with identifying nonbank financial institutions whose  \nactivities, financial distress  or failure could pose a risk to financial stability.  The Council has yet \nto identify the specific nonbank companies that will be designated in this manner. Under other authority, t he Council has identified eight systemically important financial market utilities that \nwill be subject to enhanced risk- management standards.  \nAny nonbank companies that are identified as systemical ly important and a ll banking \norganizations with more than $50 billion in total assets will be subject to heightened supervisory standards and prudential supervision by the Federal Reserve , including risk -based capit al, \nliquidity, overall risk -management an d credit exposure reporting, concentration limits, resolution \nplans or living wills , and stand alone risk committees . The Dodd- Frank Act also requires the \nFederal Reserve to conduct annual stress tests of these companies using three different scenarios  \nwith the companies further conducting their own stress tests.  \nThese standards are in various stages of the rulemaking process with the resolution plan \nrequirement being the only one that has been finalized.  Resolution plans have been submitted by \n\n \n4 \n the larg est banking organizations, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal \nReserve are currently evaluating them.   \nOther provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act with  a macroprudential or financial stability \nfocus  include a new resolution authority for financial companies whose failure would pose a \nsignificant risk to financial stability in the United States . This authority would be an alternative \nto our standard bankruptcy process , and the FDIC would act as receiver.  Other provisions \ninclude reform of t he derivatives market to increase its transparency, the Volcker R ule limits on \nproprietary trading and sponsorships of hedge and private equity funds  by banking organizations , \nand risk retention requirements for entities issuing asset -backed securities.  In addition, the act \nmandates count ercyclical capital requirements  calling for  institutions  to build up a capital buffer  \nduring strong economic periods  in order to provide an additional layer of protection during \nperiods of financial stress.  \nOverall, the Dodd -Frank Act  attempts to establish a framework for closer monitoring of \nthreats to financial stability, heightened oversight of syst emically important institutions  and a  \ncountercyclical approach to capital and liquidity.  \n \nWill These Steps Contribute to a  More Stable Financial System?  \nWith out question, the United States needed a strong response to the financial crisis , and \nmany of these new or enhanced supervisory approaches  could be useful if done well. Even so, \nthe magnitude and cost of the crisis demands that  we ask ourselves if these steps are sufficient.   \nHave we addressed the fundamental sources of the problems , and if not, W hat are the unintended \nconsequences?   \n\n \n5 \n First, the misaligned incentives and the expansion of federal safety net protections  \ncodified parts of the financial system as “too big to fail.”  Public safety net s were extended far \nbeyond anything that we , as supervisors and policymakers, had done previously, thus adding \nfurther to moral hazard.  In the United States, deposit insurance coverage was substantially \nincreased during this crisis, bank debt instruments were guaranteed, and a variety of special \ndiscount window programs were created by the Federal Reserve to expand this lending  and reach \na wider range of institu tions. The outcome of all these actions was to protect creditors and \nstockholders of  financial institutions from having to bear the full cost of their decisions  while \nshifting this burden to taxpayers. These actions further raise the question of whether we  have  \nprovide d even greater incentives to take on added risk in the future.  \nWe have attempted to address these issues through the Dodd- Frank Act . Although \nunintended, reforms that call for designating firms as systemically important may reaffirm their status as “too big to fail.”  Additionally , the enormous volume of new regulation s may not \neffectively address the weaknesses.   \nAs we have just seen  during a crisis, public officials face real concerns about creditor or \ndepositor panics, market breakdowns  and losses in public confidence, and possible connections \namong large institutions.  We should acknowledge that such concerns could be more intense \nduring the next crisis if we do not take steps now to strengthen the foundation of the financial system.  We will have to deal with the escalating safety net and associated moral hazard issues \nleft over from this crisis as well as the continued concentration of the industry . Since the end of \n2007, total assets held by the five largest banking organizations in the Unit ed States have risen \nby over  $1.7 trillion, a more than 25 percent increase . \n\n \n6 \n  Thus, reforms must focus on limiting public safety nets and the moral hazard issues they \ncreate and restoring a strong governance framework to ensure that the various participants in \nfinancial markets bear full responsibility for the decisions they make.  With regard to safety nets, \nwe must take a closer look at what they should cover and what activities are appropriate for the institutions that receiv e such protection. In the United States, this discussion is focused on the \nVolcker Rule  limits for proprietary trading , as well as  other proposals for restricting insured \ninstitutions to more traditional activities.  As shown in this crisis, we also must be sure that we \nhave an appropriate regulatory and governance fra mework in place for institutions and markets \nthat operate outside of this safety net protection. \nUnfor tunately, governance and market discipline mechanisms  are at risk of being diluted \nby a panoply of regulations . Nowhere is this more obvious than in the Dodd- Frank Act.  This act \ncontains many provisions that legislate  things bankers sh ould naturally do with the right \nincentive s in place.  For example, the act stat es that bankers cannot make a mortgage loan to a \nperson that does not have the ability to repay the loan. The act also requires  bankers to build up a  \ncapital  buffer in prosperous times to prepar e for more stressful times.  \nRather than adding regulation, we could better align incentives by allowing st ockholders, \nunsecured creditors  and bank management to be ar full responsibility for losses incurred by their \ninstitutions.  We must also  develop the  resolve not to give bank stockholders and creditors a \nrestart with capital injections and other assistance when the ir institutions get to  the brink of \nfailure.  Likewise,  managers and key employees  should have a notable financial stake tied to the \nsuccess or failure of their institution . Specifically,  incentive -based compensation and other \nremuneration for executives  should not be a one -way street  that only goes up and fails to extract \na price for financial losses.  All of these steps are necessary for a more resilient financial system.     \n\n \n7 \n A second reason  for alter ing our supervisory approach is that we risk  adding complexity \nto financial regulation  without increasing the effectiveness of our supervision. The Basel capital \nrequirements are emblematic of this  with the estimation and calibration of thousands of \nparameters —all  of which are likely to  be based on a limite d range of past samples and cycles.  \nThe complexity inherent in these standards continue s to give the most sophisticated financial \ncompanies considerable opportunities to arbitrag e the process.  Experience shows that a ssets that \nregulators felt were relatively safe and deserving of low -risk weights —such  as mortgage -backed \nsecurities and sovereign debt —instead  served as trigger points for the crisis. And by giving such \nassets low -risk weights, regulators may have encouraged greater industry -wide concen tration in \nthese instruments and, accordingly, a more severe crisis.  A number of the capital measures that \nregulators included in Tier I capital also failed to provide a ready means of support when needed.  \nOthers have found that simple capital measures, s uch as leverage ratios,  typically do a \nbetter job of separating strong banks from weak banks when compared to more complex, risk-\nbased measures.1 Our existing regulatory capital ratios  also have proven to be far less responsive \nto and reflective of financial crises and economic downturns than capital measures based on the market capitalization of institutions.  \nThe Dodd- Frank Act  itself  is full of complexity.  This law is  hundreds of  pages  long and \nits mandated rule -making by some estimates could run to as much as 30,000 pages . In contrast, \none of the most significant pieces of U .S. banking legislation, the Banking Act of 1933, is only \n37 pages long , and it included such noteworthy  steps as the  creati on of  federal deposit insurance \nand the separati on of  commercial and investment banking.     \n                                                           \n1 Andrew Haldane and Vasileios Madouros, “ The Dog and the Frisbee ,” Bank of England, given as a speech by \nHaldane at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s 36th Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, \nAugust 31, 2012.  \n\n \n8 \n Will more complex regulations contribute to a more stable financial system?  After having \nspent most of my career as a bank supervisor, I have my doubts. Supervisory lapses exposed \nduring the crisis were not the result of inadequate regulation. Instead, these lapses reflected the \nfailure of  supervisors and market participants to ask and pursue answers to the most basic and \nsimple questions: Are credit stand ards declining , and if so, what are the implications ? What \nhappens when  the surge in housing prices becomes unsustainable?  What  will be the outcome \nwhen the  compensation of key players does not reflect t he risk s and losses they might impose on \ntheir institutions ? Or, What is the likely result when the creditors and stockholders of financial \ninstitutions are protected against losses?  One could argue that posing and answering these simple \nquestions might have given supervisors  far better insight into  the fate of the financial system . \nThis brings me to my  third and final reason to evaluate our supervisory response . As we \nstrive to be macroprudentialists, we must not diminish the importance of microprudential supervision. In fact, we should increase our emphasis on traditional supervision for the largest \nfinancial firms  even as we pursue the new and unproven concepts of macroprudential \nsupervision.  \nFrom a  supervisory perspective, examiners perform such critical tasks as verifying the \nquality of a bank’s assets, understanding the bank’s business model, and evaluating lending standards and other factors that determine its risk exposure. T he judgments and decisions by \nexaminers typically provide the earliest warning signal of problems at both the  bank level and \nacross the entire financial system, and we must continue to provide examiners w ith the \nindependence, authority  and resources to fulfill this role. \nExperienced examiners , especially those who  have been through previous crises , are \nwell-positioned to recognize the type of risk exposures and conditions that could have \n\n \n9 \n macroeconomic implications . There is no substitute for the judgment of experienced examiners \nand for their ability to distinguish between institutions that can withstand significant di stress and \nthose that are no longer viable . In addition, such examiners are in the best position to ask and \nanswer the simple set of questions posed earlier about lending standards, unsustainable trends, \ncorporate governance shortcomings  and improper incentives.  \nThe br eakdown of risk models and risk- management  practices serves as a reminder that \nstress tests and other forms of quantitative analysis, as well as  the tools and conclusions of \nmacroprudential supervisors , are us eful complements to supervision but should not  substitute for \nexaminers and onsite supervision. \n \nConclusion  \nGiven the cost of the financial crisis, policymakers must be determined to mak e the \nfinancial system more resilient and stable . My own diagnosis is that we must address the \nmisguided incentives that set the stage for this crisis.  These include ever -expanding safety nets, \n“too big to fail” policies, and other incentives that inadvertently shift the threat of losses awa y \nfrom responsible parties. \nAdding new and more detailed regulations focus es on addressing the specific weaknesses \nexposed in the last crisis.  Digging deeper to address the misaligned incentives offers the potential \nfor more fundamental change to the system.  Only when financial institutions  and market \nparticipants have to fully consider the risk and consequences of their decisions —verified  with \nstrong supervisory regimes —will we be assured that next time can be different."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n                 \nConference of State Bank Supervisors  \nState -Federal Supervisory Forum  \nSavannah, Ga.  \nMay 22, 2012  \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n \n It is a pleasure to be with you today . I have  been coming to these meetings for a number \nof years , and I  have always  appreciated that key supervisory issues that are  highly  relevant to all \nof our agencies  are consistently highlighted on the agenda. This forum provides a  unique \nopportunity for the state and federal agencies to shar e view s and to learn from one another. In \naddition, t his year’s agenda has broadened the forum to include not only state supervisors and \ntheir federal counterparts, but also the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as regulator of \nfederal charters and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   \nSome have questioned  whether this diversity of regulators and views can be effective in \ntoday’s global financial market and whether the current regulatory structure is outdated and \ninefficient.  Over the years, various reforms have been proposed to improve efficiency and \neffectiveness by removing diversity . Even so, the dual banking system in the United States has \nremain ed firmly anchored in the modern world of banking and finance. And over the past 150 \nyears , financial markets in the United States  have developed into world- class centers of capital \nand have led financial innovation. \nCan this diverse regulatory model serve us well in the next ce ntury and allow the United \nStates  to maintain a strong, efficient and innovative banking system ? Does  an increasingly \nconcentrated banking industry demand fewer regulators?  Let me explain why I think this \nstructure has not only survived for 150 years but has proven to be so durable and responsive to our dynamic economy . And what will it take for the system to remain relevant going forward?  \n \nDevelopment and G rowth of the U.S. B anking S ystem\n \nThe United States ’ econom y has benefitted tremendously from  a diverse banking system  \nthat provided the means for efficiently allocating capital from savers to borr owers.  Thousands of \n\n \n state-chartered and federal -chartered financial institutions, most of which are small community \nbanks , allow credit to flow to individuals and businesses , even in remote areas of our country.  \nThe dual banking system owes its beginnings to the introduction of federally  chartered \nbanks with the passage of the National Bank Act of 1864. Prior to that, commercial banks were \ninitiall y organized under charters  granted by state legislatures —a process that became highly \npoliticized . The next step was states ’ instituting free banking laws, which allowed anyone to \nopen a bank as long as they could meet the standards specified in a  state’s banking laws.  Then \ncame the National Bank Act.  While the primary motivation for th is act appears to have been to \nhelp finance the Civil War, the a ct’s basic provisions mirrored key aspects of the free banking \nlaws that states had adopted —specifically free entry and flexibility to adapt to a changing \neconomy. Thus began the competition between state and national bank charters and the emergence of a dual banking system.  \nA report on the dual banking system prepared by the Federal Reserve in 1 930 makes it \nclear that this  system was not intentional.  Rather, as the report claims, it was expected that the \nintroduction of a federal charter and a subsequent tax on state bank notes would incent bankers  to \nconvert to federal  charters . The Fed’s 1930 report raised a number of questions about the need \nfor such a structure and noted various issues with advantages of one charter over the other. Concerns were expressed about the quality of state bank supervision—not unlike the 2012 study to be presented tomorrow. However, I firmly believe that we have a stronger supervisory system —both at the state and federal levels —as a result of dual banking.  \n \n \n\n \n Innovation and Improvement through the  Dual Banking  System  \nThe d ual banking  system  has provided and continues to offer significant benefits to our \nfinancial system and the economy. One of the primary benefits of dual banking is that the \nmultiple options for state and federal charters have led to considerable innovation and \nimprovement in  banking  services . We  have seen these benefits from the beginning.  \nFor example, it  has allowed local bankers, state supervisors and state governments to \nconstruct a banking system closely attuned to the economic needs of each state and supervised by perso nnel with a strong knowledge of the structure and condition of the local econom y. State \nlegislatures and supervisors have a long history of adopting their own set of prudential laws and regulations, consumer protection statutes, and bank chartering and expansion laws —all of which \ngenerally reflect the needs of each state.  \nA second example occurred s oon after the national banking system was esta blished. \nWhile the National Bank Act created greater competition for state chartering authorities and state banks, the playing field became steeply tilted against state banks in 1865 when the a ct was \namended to tax  the issuance of state bank notes.  As you would expect , this competitive \ndisadvantage led to a sharp decline in state banks from about 1,500 in 1864 to about 250 in 1868, whereas the number of national banks rose to about 1,650.  \nCertainly these reforms must have portended the end of state -chartered banking. But s tate \nbanks were able to overcome this uneven playing field and demonstrate their res ilience by taking \nadvantage of the growing importance of  demand deposits a nd the significant benefits they \noffered compared to bank notes . Within 10 years after the note tax, state banks had more deposits \nthan national banks , and within 25 years, there wer e more state banks (about 3,500) than national \nbanks ( about 3,100) .  \n\n \n Since then, a number of innovations resulted from changes in state banking laws . Most \nnotably , we’ve seen the development of NOW accounts, adjustable rate mortgages, home equity \nloans, and interstate banking through the use of regional compacts and nationwide entry laws \nprior to the eventual passage of national interstate banking.  \n \nChoice of Regulators  \nAnother benefit of the dual banking system is that the option to choose a regulator has \nmade bank supervision and regulation much stronger and more efficient. When the National \nBank Act was passed, the choice was between a  state banking regulator and the OCC . Since \nthen, the choice has expanded further with the addition of the Federal Reserve and Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corp. as federal regulator y options  for state banks . In fact, the choice is even \ngreater today because interstate banking allows stat e banks to choose among state banking \nauthorit ies. \nCritics of the dual banking system and the regulatory structure often claim that providing \nbanks a choice of regulator reduces bank safety and soundness and the stability of the financial system by creatin g a “race to the bottom.”  Regulatory choice, they say, leads to regulatory laxity \nas regulators compete among themselves f or larger portfolios  of supervised institutions .  \nThis is an argument without merit, in my view . I have never seen this among the bank \nregulators in my 30 years  at the Federal Reserve. In fact, I find it to be a strange argument, \nespecially when made by economists, because competition is the process that makes market economies efficient.  Choice among regulators provides an important incentive to improve \nexamination processes and ensures examiners have timely training.   \n\n \n Indeed, I would argue that providing banks regulatory choice serves as a check and \nbalance on  supervisory authorities so that they are not  so restrictive that banks are  unable to \nprovide the credit necessary for economic growth. Importantly, I’ve seen no evidence that other \nregulatory structures , including single regulator models, fared better in the most recent crisis.  \n \nPreserving the D ual B anking S ystem  \nYet if the dual banking system is to serve us well going forward, we must be willing to \nmake adjustments that adapt to a changing financial sector . One challenge is in providing states \nwith enough leeway to continue to implement laws and supervis e banks in  a manner most \nconducive to local interests and the state economy. Federal laws have continued to expand in an \neffort to create a more consistent framework across all banks —both state and national. While \nmuch of this is necessary in a nationwide banking  system, we must be careful to strike the right \nbalance in limiting the preemption of state laws and in respecting the authority of state supervisors and legislators. If we fail to achieve this balance, we risk losing many important \nbenefits of the dual ba nking system.   \nIn my view, another critical  challenge is making sure that supervision and regulation are \nconsistent across regulatory agencies and over time, as well as appropriately calibrated to  a \nbank’s business model, activities and complexity .  \nThere are many examples of coordination and cooperation. The Federal Financial \nInstitutions Examination Council is clearly an important forum for coordination and cooperation \namong the state and federal agencies.  State and federal agencies also accept  each other’s exam \nreports and share exam report software.  Also, the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors , state \n\n \n banking agencies, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve cooperated closely in setting up the \nprotocol for the seamless supervision of state banks  operating on an interstate basis. \nWe’ve been successful , although it has not always been easy, in working across agencies \nto discuss, debat e and develop joint notices of proposed rulemakings and to finalize  rules.  If we \nare to achieve our common goal of w ell-managed, well -capitalized  and well -supervised banks, \nwe will need to redouble our efforts to work together in this way.  \nIn closing, it is clear to me that the dual banking system has benefited the U.S. banking \nsystem and the overall economy since its establishment nearly 150 years ago. The diversity provided by this system allowed our economy to grow and to be the most vibrant, innovative and strongest in the world. This system has served the country well for many years, and I believe with the commitme nt of those here today it is a system that can continue to serve the public \ninterest and responsibly promote  economic growth for years to come."

Once again, the Levy Institute has come up with an \noutstanding program and one that  addresses a very timely and critical issue.   \nThere are many views about wha t went wrong in the financial markets and global \neconomy and what policy steps should now be taken to create a more stable and resilient \nfinancial sector.  To date, we have implemented a number  of changes in monetary, fiscal  and \nfinancial policies to contain the dam age and prevent future crises. Some of these policies focus \non short -term solutions, while others are more long -term focused.  \nIn my remarks, I will look at this issue largely from the longer -term need to build a \nstronger financial system structure.  I will first discuss our recent experience in the financial \nmarkets and where we may have gone wrong from a supervisory and institutional perspective. Then I will turn to what we must do from a long -term perspective to cr eate the type of financial \nsystem that will be better positioned to weather the next crisis.  \n \nOur Recent Experience  \nThis crisis is following much the same pattern of previous financial crises —an inability \nor unwillingness to see the warning signs  and take preventative action , followed by  massive \ndamage, and then working  through the emergency policy steps and the rebuilding  of our \nfinancial system . The aftermath of th is crisis left no question about the enormity of damage that \ncould be inflicted by a financial sector with too much leverage and risk. As a result , the steps we \nare taking to clean up the damage and begin long- term rebuilding take on added importance  \nbecause the polic ies we put in place now will influence —for better or worse —the  likelihood, \nnature  and severity of the next crisis. While we know we cannot prevent the next financial cris is, \n\n2 \n public policy and preventative steps play an important role in establishing the overall stability \nand resiliency of our financial system.  Consequently, getting  these steps right is essential if we \nare to avoid setting the stage for an even more severe crisis.  \nWe must also recognize that our resolve in dealing with financial crises unfortunately \ntends to diminish after a  crisis  passes.  Understandably, f inancial institutions want to get back \nquickly to a more profitable state , and the public wants a prompt and painless return to the \nprosper ity they enjoyed before the crisis.  As a result , policymakers and regulators can face \nsubstantial pressure to back off from implementing tighter oversight, especially if such oversight interferes with financial institutions going back to the ir usual  operat ing parameters.  \nMany policymakers and market participants thus become reluctant when it is time to \nmake the hard judgments about effective reforms and instituting greater risk restraints.  Signs of \nthis are already occurring with the efforts by financial institutions and others to weaken or delay stronger capital standards and other provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act.  Before elaborating on  \nthose issues, though, it is instructive to examin e some of the factors that led  to this crisis.   \nIndeed,  the housing bubb le was a major factor in the crisis, but there is one thing that \nstands  out to me as a banking supervisor: B oth the private marketplace and regulators had \nbecome complacent and greatly underestimated the risks taken on by our financial system.  \nToo many were convinced that we had entered a new era and fully believed that we had \nnew tools that could more accurately measure, price and control risk, even as financial instruments became far more complex and often were untested.  This belief, for instance, led \nsome to think that lower credit standards were simply another factor that could be priced into the terms of a subprime loan, thereby making such loans an acceptable risk. Or that bank leverage ratios were a thing of the past, especially because financial institutions and regulators could risk-\n\n3 \n weight assets and off -balance- sheet exposures and use quantitative risk models to come up with \n“better,” “more accurate,” and, invariably, lower measures of capital needs.  \nAnother factor in the crisis was misguided incentives to take on more risk. These \nincluded low short -term interest rates that encouraged financial institutions and other market \nparticipants to “borrow short and lend long” and to “search for yield.”  These funding and lending \nincentives, along with other factors such as the low Basel risk weights assigned to certain \nfinancial instruments, further motivated major institutions to adopt very similar risk exposures.  \nThese exposures, in turn, contributed to the liquidity and funding breakdowns that were central to this crisis.  Other misaligned incentives included the belief that larger institutions were “too big \nto fail” and the implicit guarantees behind the government -sponsored enterprise s and certain \nother parts of the financi al system —all  of which gave creditors and stockholders added \nprotection from default and less reason to be concerned about risk. \nWe also have had numerous changes in the structure of our financial markets over the \npast few decades, which have left us with a much different corporate culture in banking and finance.  In fact,  the new structure has brought with it a greater focus on short -term performance \nand more aggressive attitudes regarding ri sk-taking.  These changes include  a rapidly rising \nconcentration in the banking industry, withering away of the Glass -Steagall constraints on banks \nengaging in securities activities, and the growth of securitization and money and capital markets.  \nCultural change i n investment banking began to occur more than 40 years ago, when the \nNew York Stock Exchange relaxed its rules to allow member securities firms to break away from their partnership structure and adopt a corporate framework. With partnerships, the driving force had always been to safeguard the value of partnership interests by maintaining the long -run \nprosperity of the firm and developing new partners with similar objectives. Bringing in outside \n\n4 \n capital through conversion to a corporate structure —which  all major  securities firms did by \n1999—put  these firms under gre ater investor pressure to exploit short -term opportunities and \nengage in riskier strategies.  As banks took on more investment banking activities, competitive \npressures then led to similar changes in the culture of banking. The outgrowth of all these \nchanges in the financial system was a complacency and false confidence in new risk-management practices and a substantial  and largely unrecognized build- up in leverage and risk \nthat laid the groundwork for this crisis.  Unfortunately, the pendulum swung from conf idence that  \nwe could measure and control virtually any risk to the opposite —an  environment  during the \ncrisis  where market participants had virtually no idea how to price  many financial instruments \nnor how to determine  which institutions were still sound.  \n \nLooking to the Long R un \nIf we are to construct a stronger financial system, we must address the significant \nproblems and obvious shortcomings that led to the crisis.  First and foremost is to correct the \nmisaligned incentives and the improper expansion of f ederal safety net protections that \nencouraged and enabled institutions to take excessive risks. In addition, I believe we must return \nsupervision to its traditional role of exercising sound judgment and making informed decisions. In recent years, the super visor’s role has become a more passive one, with examiners spending \nmuch time monitoring regulatory c ompliance and tracking the risk -management practices \nadopted by financial institutions.  \nWith regard to correcting the incentives in banking, the most impor tant challenge we face \nis in constructing an appropriate, but carefully limited, public safety net. During this crisis, our safety net was stretched far beyond anything we had previously done, and this expansion in \n\n5 \n safety net protections has left us with a  broad and pervasive range of moral hazard issues. Not \nonly did we expand deposit insurance coverage during the crisis, but we also guaranteed bank \ndebt instruments, used the discount window to lend to nonbank institutions and conduct special lending progr ams, and bailed out large institutions and segments of the financial markets not \ncovered by the traditional safety net.  The largest financial institutions in the United States further \nreceived significant injections of public capital through TARP. Some would argue  the only ones \nnot protected from losses were the taxpayers.  \nIt is hardly a coin cidence that at the center of this crisis w ere a substantial expansion in \npublic safety nets and the presence of major financial institutions , which were treated as being \ntoo big to fail  (TBTF) . This linkage between expanded safety nets and TBTF institutions has  \nincreased in importance over the last few decades, with the growth of one linked to the  growth of \nthe other —all  in a cycle that poses a signi ficant threat to financial s tability . \nThis link between large institutions and special public support has left us trapped in a \npattern in which public authorities believe they must  expand the  safety net each time a crisis is  \nbrought on by excesses in risk- taking  at large institutions . This broadening of the safety net \nfacilitates  the next and even more severe crisis , as new moral hazard issues  are introduced and \nmajor institutions are left with  greater incentives for taking on risk. The critical and definin g \nquestion for us is how to  break  this pattern of growing safety nets and escalating crises, while \nrestor ing much -needed market discipline to the  financial system.  \nI believe the first and most important step that we can take is to eliminate  TBTF  policies . \nThis crisis provided overwhelming evidence that the ingrained response of policymakers is to treat our largest institutions as being TBTF.  With the help of bailouts, TARP money, the \ndiscount window , accommodative monetary policy  and other actions, our larg est institutions not \n\n6 \n only survived the crisis, but in many cases, emerged as even larger players in the financial \nsystem.  \nThe funding, capital  and other advantages that TBTF provides are enormous, and such \nadvantages —as seen in this crisis —remove  important  constraints on risk- taking that financial \ninstitutions would otherwise face from their stockholder s, creditors  and uninsured depositors. \nOne simple example of these advantages is that the five largest U.S. banking organizations in June 2009 wer e given rat ings on their senior  long -term bank debt that on average were four \nnotches higher than what they would have received based on their actual condition alone. One of these organ izations even received an eight -notch upgrade for being TBTF. In a very competitiv e \nmarketplace, such advantages are enormous and highly unfair to those institutions not receiving them.  These ratings advantages conti nue to exist after the crisis —albeit  at a notch or two less \nnow, and investors  have reason to believe that similar advantages may yet exist.   \nWhat can be done to address these moral hazard and TBTF issues?  The Dodd- Frank Act \nprovides an orderly liquidation authority for resolving the failure of a systemically important organization, thus adding to the existing framework  for closing insolvent or nonviable \ncommercial banks.  Having this legal framework, though, is only the first, and perhaps easiest, \nstep in dealing with TBTF.  In fact, during the recent crisis we had a number of powers that might \nhave  been used on TBTF institutions , but were not employed to any notable extent . I’ll offer just  \none example.  \nPart of the discipline associated with taking on expanded powers under the Gramm -\nLeach -Bliley Act was that all depository institutions  in a financial holding company were \nrequired  to remain  well capitalized and well managed.  If not, the company would have 180 days \nto correct the deficiencies or face divestiture of its depository institutions or termination of newly \n\n7 \n authorized financial a ctivities . To the extent that such divestitures or terminations might be \ndifficult to do in the midst of a crisis, the  Act gave the Federal Reserve the flexibility to grant \nadditional time  for such  restructuring s. One might fairly ask whether all of the  major financial \nholding companies  were in strict compliance with these provisions throughout the crisis  or \nwhether pursuing such actions  might have been justified .  \nThus , as we can see from this crisis, the most critical issue in addressing TBTF concerns \nis having policymakers with the resolve to follow through. In a crisis, there will always be \nconcerns about creditor or depositor panics, public confidence issues, interconnections with other \ninstitutions  and disruptions in financial services. While I believe these concerns often are \nexaggerated and can be minimized through the resolution frameworks we now have in place, others will almost certainly have different views.  What we must remember, though, is that \nending TBTF is the only sure way to curtail the expansion of public safety nets and break t he \npattern of repeated and ever -escalating financial crises.  \nA second step we must take is to strengthen bank capital standards  with particular \nemphasis on leverage requirements tied to equity capital. In addition, we should weigh carefully  \nthe lengthy transition period contemplated by Basel III.  There is risk that banks will be caught \nshort again if we adopt a lengthy phase -in period and let banks manage their capital down to the \nminimum transition standards throu gh substantial dividend payouts and stock buybacks.  \nI am cautious about relying heavily on risk- based capital standards for two reasons. First, \nbanks have been quick to arbitrage  whatever risk -based standards are in place, and second, it is \nhard to say tha t our risk weights have been accurate measures of risk.  For example, many \nmortgage -backed securities were constructed to marginally meet the requirements for lower risk \nweights . These risk weights , moreover, bore little relation to the losses banks took on such \n\n8 \n securities during  the crisis.  Instead, we must insist on capital standards that can fully protect \nagainst losses—both expected and unexpected —and we must avoid creating standards that give \ninstitutions incentives to adopt more concentrated risk expos ures.  \nI am also in favor of some constraints on the type of activities that can be conducted by \ninstitutions protected by the safety net.  The expansion in activities conducte d by banking \norganizations over the past few decades has greatly increased the lev el of complexity in such \norganizations, making effective management and supervision of these entities much more \ndifficult.  In addition, this growth in activities has brought with it a changing culture in banking —\none that is more characteristic of investmen t banking  and other parts of the capital markets .  \nAccordingly , the major banking organizations have become much more concerned about \nexploiting short -term opportunities and expanding their risk  exposures , and many of the financial \nincentives provided to key personnel in banking organizations have become more closely aligned with those in investment banking. For these reasons, I support the goals of the Volcker Rule in \neliminating proprietary trading by bank and thrift organizations , and I hope we can deve lop an \nappropriate regulatory and supervisory framework to implement these provisions . We should \nalso take a careful look at other financial activities and their compatibility with public safety nets  \nto avoid a replay of the expanded safety nets and the public assistance that was provided to \nfinancial institutions in  this crisis .  \nMy final comments concern the role of bank examiners. Increasingly, examiners have \nhad to spend more time reviewing risk -management practices at banks and compliance with a \nwide variety of regulations. Th ese demands will grow  as examiners become more involved in \nstress tests, enhanced supervision, living wills and other features of the Dodd- Frank Act.  \n\n9 \n While I recognize these aspects of supervision warrant examiner attention, they should \nnot detract from the more traditional and time -tested efforts of examiners in  verify ing the quality \nof a bank’s assets, understanding  the bank’s business model  and evaluat ing lending standards \nand other factors that shape  risk within a bank. In my e xperience, t he judgments and decisions by \nexaminers typically provide the earliest warning signal of problems at a bank , and we must \ncontinue to provide examiners with the independence and authority to fulfill this role. Also, as \nimpartial observers, exami ners are likely to be in the best position to identify the type of risk \nexposures and conditions that could lead to a crisis, particularly in the case of examiners who have dealt with previous crises. In fact, d uring my career in supervision, I have seen no substitute \nfor the judgment of experienced examiners . This crisis further indicates the need to have \nexaminers with the ability and knowledge to distinguish between institutions that are viable entities capable of withstanding significant financial distr ess and those that can no longer \ncontinue in their current condition. \nThe br eakdown of risk models and risk- management practices during the crisis also  tells \nme that we must not view stress tests, other  forms of quantitative analysis  and models used by \nmacroprudential supervisors as being a substitute or replacement for examiners and onsite supervision. In particular, the breakdown we have seen in models -based approaches suggests that \nwe should not develop a false sense of security from the stress tests and other new supervisory \ntools we are now putting in place. While these tools can be useful additions to supervision, we must recognize the  very important and unique role that examiners have in supervision and their \nability to  bring a strong sense of reality and caution to the oversight of the financial system.  \nMicroprudential supervision must re main an essential and central part of our supervisory \nframework.  \n\n10 \n  \nConcluding Comments  \nWe now face a real challenge in rebuilding our financial system and its supervisory \nframework.  The steps we take today  will either serve us well in the inevitable future financial \nshock, or they will sow the seeds of the next crisis. If we are to be successful, though, we must \nstop and ask ourselves what really went wrong this time and what can we do to construct a more \nstable and resilient financial system.  \nI would like to conclude with a thought very aptly expressed in the Central Ba nk of \nNorway’s 2009 Financial Stability Report: “It is difficult to estimate the probability and price the risk of all possible outcomes in financial markets.  This particularly applies to events that occur \nrarely and have not occurred for a long time…In the long term, public authorities have an important role to play in maintaining a collective memory of previous crises.”"
