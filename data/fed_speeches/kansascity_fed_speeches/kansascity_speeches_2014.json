George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWisconsin Bankers Association  \nEconomic Forecast Luncheon  \nMadison, Wis . \nJanuary 9, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n \n \n1 \n It is a pleasure to be here today  to discuss my outlook for the U.S. economy, the stance of \nmonetary policy, and key issues facing community bank s. The focus on community banking is \nnot because the Wisconsin Bankers Association invited me here, but because c ommunity banks \nplay a vital role i n supporting economic activity in their local communities .  \n \nEconomic Outlook  \nThe U .S. economy has been recovering steadily over the past few years while facing \nvarious obstacles ranging from fiscal policy issue s to weak global growth.  As we start a new \nyear, t he economic outlook is brighter  with r eal gross domestic  product ( GDP ) show ing steady \ngrowth  over each of the last three quarters. Some of the improvement has been driven by \ntemporary factors, such as inventory accumulation , but if we look past such  transitory issues , the \ndata suggest the growth outlook for 2014 may be among the strongest since the end of the \nrecession.    \nOne simple reason growth should improve is because the initial impact of last year’s \nfiscal policy stance  has eased . The cumulative effect of the  mandated spending cuts and higher \ntaxes, by some estimates , was to lower overall real GDP growth by about 1.5 percentage points . \nGranted, there  will likely be further adjustments  to fiscal policy  to ensure long -term stability , but \nwith the effects from 2013 fading and the recent budget agreement red ucing some  policy \nuncertainty , the growth outlook is more positive .  \nBeyond these fiscal issues , however, and m ore important ly because consumer spending \naccounts for more than two -thirds o f the economy , is the fundamental strengthening in private \ndemand . Better labor market s, stronger household balance sheets,  and income  growth  have \nfostered this improvement . Real disposable income growth and average hourly earnings in the \n\n \n \n2 \n private sector have been trending higher . Employment  growth , too, has been gaining strength , as \nnearly every major sector has higher employment compared to a year ago. In fact, g overnment is \nthe only major sector to have shed jobs over the past year, but even that trend has shown signs of \nreversing. Combined, net job creation is close to  its fastest pace since the end of the crisis.  \nBusinesses also are well -position ed to begin increasing investment in new capital. \nCorporate profits are at record highs , balance sheets are healthy and many firms have the \nresources to make new capital expen ditures and expand capacity. That said, m any businesses  \nhave remained cautious the past few years due to a number of uncertainties that include the \nstrength of the global and U.S. recovery, the impact of regulations and new laws, and concerns \nover the direction of both fiscal and monetary policy. To the extent these uncertainties fade and \nglobal growth strengthens, as it could if Europe continues to recover, business investment is \npoised for growth . \nAccordingly, a bsent an unexpected s hock or a downturn  in global growth  this year , I \nexpect U.S. growth for 2014 to be in the range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, reflecting the \ncombination of less fiscal drag, hea lthier household balance sheets  and improving labor \nmarkets —one of the better years in some  time.   \nEven as growth projections strengthen , inflation measures remain low . In fact, s ome have \nquestioned whether inflation is too low given the Fed’s inflation target of 2  percent  or whether \nthe United States  could face the risk of deflatio n. I do not share those concerns  because s everal \nspecial factors appear to be weighing on inflation  measures , such as lower -than-usual health care \ncosts, changes in how the price of some financial services are calculated , and low import prices . \nAdditionally , longer -term inflation expectations have remained stable near the 2  percent  goal.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n  \nMonetary Policy  \nSince 2008, the Federal Reserve has maintained an extraordinary level of monetary \naccommodation to support the economy.  With short -term interest rates nea r zero, the Federal \nOpen Market Committee ( FOMC ) has also used unconventional policy tools such as large -scale \nasset purchases (known as quantitative easing or QE ) to lower longer -term rates and boost asset \nprices.   \nLast month, the FOMC  took its first step  in reducing the pace of asset purch ases referred \nto as QE3 . With the improving outlook and confidence that the gains in the labor market will be \nsustained, the Committee decided in December  to slow the pace of purchases from $85 billion \nper month to $75 b illion —a decision I supported . Although this is a modest step, it is an \nimportant part of the process of moving toward  a more -normal interest rate environment , which I \nview not only as essential but also as a positive development for the economy  and the banking \nindustry . Even so, monetary policy is likely to remain highly accommodative for some time with \nadditional (albeit reduced) asset purchases under the current program and an extended period of \nlow interest rates.  I remain concerned about the  potential costs and consequences of these \nuntested policies.  \n \nSecuring An Effective Regulatory Framework  \nAs the U .S. economy continues its path to full recovery, a vibrant and diverse system of \nbanks with sustainable, long -term prospects is critical to support the health of local and regional \neconomies, and therefore, the national economy. Let me turn now to how the industry is \npositioned to carry out that important  function .  \n\n \n \n4 \n Overall, the health of community banks is good, although it  has not fully recovered to \npre-crisis levels.  Net earnings have been relatively flat since 2012 , but they are at a respectable \nlevel of about  1 percent of assets.  Problem assets are trending down, and  although they are still \nsomewhat elevated, I expect the trend to continue.  Capital ratios also continue  to strengthen . \nWhat concerns me, though, is that the quality of net earnings is not strong. Earnings have \nbeen largely supported by d eclining provisions and reserve releases, which we  know cannot \ncontinue much longer.  At the same time , we’ve seen that the net interest margin, which is the \nprimary source of revenue  for community banks, has lost much of its post -recession  gain and is \nnear a 40 -year low  due to the  low interest rates  and weak loan demand.   \nWith this extreme pressure on net interest margins, b anke rs have expressed concern about \nlower  underwriting standards, l onger  maturities at fixed rates  and increased co mpetition from \nlarger banks that are likely to pull out of  local  markets when the economy improves further.  \nBank supervisors are monitoring these risks for vulnerabilities that will lead to asset quality \nproblems when interest rates start to rise or if there is a downturn in the economy.  Even so, an \nextended period of zero interest rates is not conducive to good banking and encourage s a reach \nfor yield .  \nThe effects of this unfavorable interest rate environment are compounded by the \nregulatory framework.  After two decades of deregulation and misplaced confidence in the ability \nof market discipline to moderate risk exposures , the pendulum has swung in favor of new, \ncomplex regulation.  Congress re sponded to the financial panic and the resulting deep recessio n \nby passing the Dodd -Frank Act, aimed at reducing the systemic risks posed to our economy by \nfirms  that we commonly refer to  as too  big to fail ( TBTF ). It remains unclear whether the new \nregulatory regime will in fact end TBTF and thereby reduce the syste mic risk posed by the \n\n \n \n5 \n largest banks  and the subsidy they enjoy . My own view is that incentives have not changed in a \nway that would achieve the desired outcome of a safer , more competitive financial system.   \nWhat is clear is that while much effort has been directed to implementing the Dodd -Frank \nAct, the competitive and regulatory pressures on the community bank model ha ve only \nworsened . Over the past 30 years, the distribution of banking assets across community, regional \nand large  global banks has moved steadily toward more concentration.  Industry concentration \nhas accelerated over the past 15 years with the 10 largest banking firms increasing their share of \nindustry assets from 44 percent in 1997 to 68 percent in 201 3. Even more s triking, their size has \nalmost tripled as a share of GDP, rising from 24 percent to 68 percent.  With this growing scale, \nthe scope of their activities exp anded as well.  In 1997, these large banking organizations held \nnearly 90 percent of their assets in traditional banking activities . In 2013, traditional banking \naccount ed for just 67 percent  of assets . And the five largest banks designated as posing a \nsystemic risk hold far less equity as a percent of total assets than community banks.  In fact, \nWisconsin  banks alone have capital ratios that are 35 percent higher than these five largest \nbanks.    \nCommunity banks have lost market share to these large players  with a share of industry \nassets half as large as 15 years ago, falling from 35  percent to 17  percent.  Yet, they have \ngenerally retained a business model that we assoc iate with traditional banking: making loans and \ntaking deposits in their local communities. In fact, community banks make more than half of all \nsmall business loa ns and extend credit in thous ands of locales across the country , including rural \nareas . Return on equity may be the bottom line in financial reports, but the foundation for the \ncommunity bank is c ustomer relationships and community economic health.   \n\n \n \n6 \n So as we look toward an improving outlook for 2014, the viability of community banking \nin the current regulatory and monetary policy environment is a relevant consideration  given their \nimportant role in meet ing local credit needs . \nAs a former community ban k examiner, I understand how the increase in regulations and \nrules  translates into higher operating costs and can influence decisions about whether to continue \ncertain business lines.  And, i ronically, this increased regulatory burden and low rate  \nenvironment —all undertaken with good intentions t o address the crisis —are disproportionately \naffecting community banks and accelerating the pace of consolidation trends . \nTo address the regulatory burden  on community banks , a rising chorus is calling for a \ntwo-tiered regulatory system  to better calibrate regulations according to the business model and \nsize of banks.  While  I am sympathetic to the idea of this kind of differentiation  and the desired \nrelief it hopes to offer , I do not think it is the answer.  As we have seen with certain provisions of \nthe Dodd -Frank Act, c alibrating regulations across broad groupings of banks is very difficult and \nthe outcomes  are not always as intended . And  fundamentally , it does not address a more \nthreatening issue to the viability of community banks and the perseverance of a diverse banking \nsystem . That issue is TBTF . We must pursue the essential reform needed to eliminat e TBTF , \nwhich is the cause of the increasingly complex regulatory system confronting community bank s \nand stands in the way of secur ing a financial system that serves —not threatens —the economic \nwell-being of the country.   \nI realize that ending TBTF is not necessarily viewed as a community bank’s biggest \nissue.  In my own region, community bankers will readily acknowledge that TBTF is a serious \nproblem , but their focus understandably is on the competitor across the street which is generally \na government sponsored enterprise , a credit union or another community or regional bank . \n\n \n \n7 \n Others are reluctant to ca ll for reform of these large st banks because they view all banks as part \nof the same industry  and advocate such . Still o thers have become resigned to TBTF as a \npermanent fixture of the global financial system  that cannot be changed  and therefore hinge the \ncommunity bank’s survival prospects on tiered regulation as the most  practical answer to the \nregulatory burden.   \nIn many respects, p olicymakers have already moved toward a bifurcated regulatory \nsystem by resorting to massive and complex rules for TBTF bank s in hopes of smothering their \nsystemic risk.  These rules may temporarily handicap TBTF risks, but I do not believe these \npolicies can solve the problem.  Research suggests that regulatory complexity incentivizes the \nregulated to game the rules (Kane) , while other research finds that simple rules are harder to \nmanipulate and more durable (Haldane).1  \nConsider capital requirements as an example.  Banks with more than $50 billion in assets \nare subject to higher minimum risk -based capital standards than sma ller banks so that they have \na larger cushion of capital given the systemic risk they pose to the economy. Yet when you look \nat the actual amount of capital that they hold relative to their total assets, their capital ratios are \nlower. For example,  the Tie r 1 leverage ratio of the 10 largest bank holding companies is 8 \npercent , which  is significantly lower than the 10.3 percent held by community banks, and even \nlower relative to the 11.2 percent held by Wisconsin community banks.     \nBecause community banks and TBTF banks are inextricably linked by public safety nets, \nI believe it is in the long -term interest of community banks and the health of our economy to rely \n                                                           \n1 Edward Kane, “ Good Intentions and Unintended Evil: The Case Against Selective Credit Allocation ,” Journal of \nMoney, Credit, and Banking, February 1977.

Our existing regulatory framework res ts on sound principles —\na safe, stable  and competitive banking system; equal access to services;  consumer  protection ; and \nthe preventi on of  illegal activities.  To implement these principles, we need rules for banks of all \nsizes that are understandable, enforceable  and equitable.  We also need a supervisory process \nwith appropriate flexibility so examiners can apply experienced judgment and thereby \ndifferentiate the supervisory regime based on the risk profile and business practices of individual \ninstituti ons.  \nIn addition, p olicymakers should consider alternatives that could foster both a safer \nsystem and a simpler regulatory framework.  Such alternatives include strengthening the \nseparati on of  banking and commerce or adopting a modern version of G lass-Steagall.2 \nUnfortunately, these ideas  have been sidetracked as too blunt or overly simplistic.  Such \nreforms would change incentives to take excessive risk and would simplify the largest banking \norganizations , provid ing a stronger foundation for management and boards of directors to govern \ncompliance and risk management . For supervisors , it would improve their ability  to enforce  rules  \nand facilitate orderly resolutions if a large bank fails . Until TBTF and its subsidized advantages \nare adequately addressed, econ omic security remains at risk , and community banks might well \nexpect to lose market share  while continuing to deal with the issue of how future regulatory \nchanges can appropriately be applied to them.  \n \n \n \n                                                           \n2 For a proposal for a modern version of Glass -Steagall, see Thomas M.

The \nbanking industry  is stronger and better able  to serv e the nation’s credit needs.  Community banks \nin particular face challenges in serving  the credit needs of their customers and their communities  \ndue to impediments from ill-suited regulatory policies . In the near -term, timely s hifts in \nmonetary policy a nd better calibration of regulatory requirements  may offer potential relief to \nsmaller banks . Ultimately, though, ending TBTF and its related advantages wi ll serve to enhance \nthe viability of community banks  and restore public confidence.  I am hopeful that policymakers \nwill continue to vigorously pursue this important objective.",

        "content": "Current Monetary Policy and the Implications for Supervision and Regulation  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNinth BCBS -FSI High -Level Meeting for Africa on  \n“Strengthening Financial Sector Supervision and Current Regulatory Priorities”  \nCape Town, South Africa  \nJanuary 31, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or represent atives.  \n\n1 \n  \nI am very pleased to be here today . This meeting provides an excellent opportunity to \nhear what others are doing to strengthen their supervisory systems , including those here in \nAfrica . It also provides a n important venue for turning our attention to the long -run implications \nof polic ies and w hat we can do to create a more -resilient financial system.   \nFinancial supervisors and regulators are clearly facing unique challenges in the aftermath \nof the financial crisis.  In the Unite d States , financial institutions are stronger , although they still \nhave not recovered fully from the problems they experienced during the crisis. Demand for credit \nhas been relatively anemic during the domestic and global econom ic recover y, hindering efforts \nby these institutions to restore their lending busine ss and other activities to more -normal levels.  \nAs supervisors, we face the additional challenge of implementing the many new laws and \nreforms that our countries have instituted in response to the  crisis and to enhance  financial \nstability.   \nThere is another challenge  that threatens to undermine our best supervisory efforts and \ncould set the stage for instability  if it is not addressed appropriately and in a timely manner . This \nchallenge comes from the continued reliance on highly accommodative and unconventional \nmonetary policies and the incentives such policies provide to pursue riskier banking and \ninvestment strategies.  These policies have the effect of dampening the profitability of traditional \nbanking activities, thus encouraging ban kers and other market participants to look for greater \nreturns in other, riskier  areas . \nToday, I will focus my remarks on  the risks that current U.S. monetary policy poses to \nfinancial stability  and the challenges it  creates for supervisors . Then I will explore what steps \nsupervisors  might take to address these threats.  \n \n\n2 \n Current Monetary Policy and the Financial Implications  \nIn response to the financi al crisis, the Federal Reserve and other central banking \nauthorities significantly lowered their policy rates during the financial crisis and have continued \nto hold these rates near zero. In some countries, these highly accommodative monetary policies \nhave been supplemented by quantitat ive easing programs, expanded  central bank lending \nauthority  and forward guidance statements committing central banks to hold rates low well into \nthe future.  \nIn the United States, the Federal Open Market Committee has held the federal funds rate \nin a 0 to ¼ percent range since December 2008. Furthermore, the Committee’s forward guidance  \nstates that it anticipate s maintaining these rates “well past the time that the unemployment rate \ndrops below 6 1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to r un below the \nCommittee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”    \nTo provide additional monetary stimulus, the Federal Reserve has also implemented three \nquantitative easing programs, involving extensive  purchases of long -term U. S. Treasury \nsecurities and mortgage -backed securities issued by go vernment sponsored enterprises.  These \nefforts began in late 2008. Since September 2012, the Fed has been buying $40 billion in \nmortgage -backed securities every month and about $45 billion in long -term Treasuries —a policy \nthat the FOMC announced last month would be tapered back by $5 billion less in each category \nper month. This week the FOMC committed to another $5 billion reduction in each of these \ncategories. As shown in Chart 1, t hese quantitative easing programs have led to substantial  \nexpan sion in  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet —from around $800 billion in late 2008 to more \nthan $4 trillion currently —and much of its traditional asset holdings have been replaced with \nlonger-term Treasury and mortgage -backed securities . \n\n3 \n The FOMC continue s to support  current levels of monetary accommodation as desirable \nand necessary as long as the growth in GDP and employment is slow and inflation remains low.  \nAlthough the benefits of the current policy settings are presumed to outweigh potential costs, this \ntradeoff is not well understood . Accordingly , I remai n concerned that continuation of these \npolicies could have significant long -term costs.  \nThe costs of accommodative policies , moreover, may not be confined to just the countri es \nwith expansive policies. Such  policies can influence other countries by distorting their exchange \nrates and balance of payment positions, capital flows and rates of credit expansion.  \nAs a former bank supervisor, I also am concerned about the effects of  current monetary \naccommodation on the banking industry and financial stability. Simply put, hold ing the price of \ncredit at near zero rates for years can negatively impact  institutions whose primary business is \nmaking loans. As central banks undertake unprecedented actions to alter rates and prices in \nfinancial markets , we should not be surprised to find unintended , negative  side effects.  \nZero interest rate and quantitative easing policies clearly limit the returns that bankers \ncan achieve in their traditional lending and investment activ ities, thus affecting the profitability \nof what we would view as essential banking activities. Beyond this, the forward guidance of \ncentral banks provides little assurance to bankers that this lending environment will improve —an \noutcome that is further com pounded by modest economic growth and a more -limited pool of \ncreditworthy borrowers for banks.  \nIn addition, bankers face a great deal of uncertainty. Monetary policy has taken us far \nfrom a normal financial environment, and the influence that accommodative policy and \nquantitative easing will ultimately have on longer -term rates and inflation expectations is \nunclear. Similar ly, some bankers are uncertain about how much of the surge in deposits produced \n\n4 \n by accommodative monetary policies can be retained by their banks  once interest rates and the \ncompetition for funds increase  (See Chart 2) .      \nAs supervisors, we can conclude  that this uncertainty and reduced p rofitability in \ntraditional banking activities can provide a nearly irresistible incentive to expand into \nnontraditional and higher -risk activities. Bankers are also likely to  “chase yields” by increasing \ntheir credit an d interest rate exposures and by increasing their own leverage.  There are signs that \nsuggest we are already on this path —a path that is likely  to become even more popular and \nenticing as financial competition increase s and memories from the fears and threa ts of the \nfinancial crisis  continue to fade . \nBank net interest margins are already near historic lows  as loan rates remain compressed \nand traditional banking activities no longer generate the profits they once did  (See Chart 3) . As a \nresult, low interest rate policies may have the adverse effect of impeding  traditional bank lending  \nchannels  and reducing the availability of funds for business expansion . It should be no surprise \nthat bankers supply less credit when the returns are so low —an outcome that keep s the economy \nwell below its potential and , hence,  more vulnerable to possible shocks.   \nSeveral measures point to the banking industry taking on added risk in an attempt to \nrestore profitability. While overall lending growth has been slow, the gr eatest growth appears to \nbe taking place in higher -risk categories, including oil and gas lending and leveraged lending  \n(See Chart 4) . Much of the recent growth in leveraged lending, moreover, is characterized by \nweaker underwriting standards, including hi gher debt ratios and fewer covenant protections.  This \ndeterioration in credit standards may not yet be a serious concern, but it is reasonable to assume \nthat lenders will be even more aggressive in  relax ing their terms as they seek more business  and \nattemp t to counter a prolonged low rate environment . \n\n5 \n In addition, m ore interest rate risk may be building up in the banking industry as bankers \nrespond to incentives  to move out along the yield curve to generate earnings. In this regard, there \nare signs that a rising number of banks are increasing their holdings of longer -term securities and \nloans —all at a time when long -term rates may rise as economic growth strength ens (See Chart \n5).     \nA final outcome of unconventional monetary policy and the incentives created by low \nrates could be a repeat of some of the liquidity and asset bubble problems experienced during \nthis crisis. For instance, “borrow short and lend long”  strategies are likely to be an outgrowth of \nthe current environment and could eventually lead to another round of liquidity problems. Also, \nwhile it is hard to identify asset bubbles with much certainty or timeliness , we have already seen \nrapid increases in farmland prices and stock prices in the United States  (See Chart 6) .  \n \nWhat Can Supervisors Do?  \nEven as we see improvements in our financial markets, the se concerns suggest \nsupervisors still face key challenges and must  give serious thought to how such challenges  might \nbe addressed . Relative to the highly accommodative and unconventional mone tary policy \nsettings in the United States , initial steps have been taken to slow the pace of asset purchases. I \nview this as a modest but positive step, allowing financial markets to better price risk and \nallocate credit  and to provide the proper incentives for conducting traditional banking services. \nHowever, until policy normalizes , supervisors must deal with whatever risks might arise.   \nSome would argue  that rece nt financial reforms have left supervisors with a better set of \ntools to address  the type of liquidity, capital  and asset bubble problems recently encountered.   \nConsiderable effort has been made to create  a new system of macroprudential supervision, \n\n6 \n countercyclical capital standards, liquidity requirements, stress tests  and enhanced supervision of \nsystemically important institutions. These approaches require careful quantification and \nmeasurements of risk, massive data se ts, forward -looking assessment s and more model -driven \napproaches. As we gain further experience with these tools, they may indeed provide additional \ninsights into financial markets and their vulnerabilities.  \nIn implementing this new framework, though, there are a number of inherent pro blems  \nand challenges . When is the right time to impose countercyclical capital buffers? Will policy and \ninformation lags and the time that must be given for institutions to raise capital mean that  such \nactions will be delayed until they are no longer usefu l or are even counterproductive? A similar \nset of concerns surround s stress testing. What are the right scenarios , and are all key risks \nincorporated into the tests?  \nWe should also note that a number of central banks did engage in a form of \nmacroprudential  supervision before the crisis through their Financial Stability Reports. Overall, \nthese reports show  that potential risks were  identified  before the crisis , but it was far  more \ndifficult for central banks to judge whether these risks w ould be fully realiz ed and to then pursue  \ncorrective supervisory action in an effective and timely manner.  Consequently, while we \ncontinue to experiment with macroprudential supervision,  we must place primary emphasis on a \nmore traditional set of supervisory responses.  \nWhat steps should we be taking now in our role as supervisors? First, given that it will be \ndifficult to identify and quickly respond to the risks emerging under current monetary policies, I \nwould argue for continuing to strengthen bank capital through hig her leverage ratios. Our \nexperience in the recent financial crisis provides strong evidence that risk -based capital standards \nmay fail to capture actual risk levels and can further be exploited by bankers.  \n\n7 \n As shown in Chart 7, the ratio of risk -weighted as sets to total assets among large U .S. \nbanking organizations  steadily declined before the crisis . While this chart might imply that these \norganizations were shifting toward safer assets , the resulting losses from the crisis certainly did \nnot correspond to lower levels  of risk on their balance sheets . \nGiven the apparent shortcomings in risk -based capital standards,  stronger leverage ratios \nare the simplest and most direct way to ensure adequate capital in banks . Consequently , as \nquickly as possible, we should move toward higher leverage ratios and set these ratios at levels \nthat will provide enough  capital in a  broad range of adverse economic scenarios . \nSecond, we should take a careful look at what we allow banks to do . In parti cular, we \nshould think about  how we can encourage traditional activities and the risks that are most \nconsistent with public safety nets . One approach  we are taking  in the United States is to restrict \nthe pr oprietary trading activities of bank ing organizati ons through the Volcker Rule. These \nrestrictions have not been easy to design, but they offer a way to limit the incentives for certain \nriskier activities that may seem attractive , especially now,  to improve profitability . \nA final point on strengthening su pervision is that we must continue to emphasize \nmicroprudential supervision and the important role that bank examiners play. It seems  clear that \nmany factors behind the recent financial crisis might have been detected through traditional \nexamination and supervisory processes if properly supported and performed correctly.  \nFor example , lax lending standards, risky fund ing strategies, poor governance and overly \noptimistic risk -management strategies all played key  roles in the crisis. Each of these is a factor \nthat experienced examiners have the best chance of identifying at an early, remedial stage  and \nthen pursuing corrective action and improved  bank risk -management practices . In contrast, these  \nrisks and wea knesses may be difficult to estimate  until much later and are thus likely to  escape \n\n8 \n timely detection if we rely primarily on purely quantitative approaches and other elements of \nmacroprudential supervision.  \nTo the extent similar weaknesses emerge  as an out grow th of current monetary polic ies \nand risk appetites , strong examination processes are a critical element in flagging such risks  at \nthe firm level.  However, limiting the conditions or incentives for risk -taking and their broader \neffect s on financial stability  must be recognized as beyond the scope of supervision  \n \nConcluding Comments  \n Supervisors face a number of challenges associated with implementing new rules and \nreforms, but they must also remain attentive to the incentives for risk -taking in an unusually low \nand prolon ged interest rate environment. The incentives to reach for yield and boost profitability \npose particular challenges for supervisors and could introduce undesirable and destabilizing \nconditions.   \nAlthough recent financia l reforms have given  supervisors a broad  range of new tools, \nconsiderable value remains to affect supervisory outcomes through  the microprudential tools we \nalready have. Key steps we can and should take include imposing stronger leverage \nrequirements , focus ing banking activities on traditional c redit intermediation functions , and \nusing experienced and skilled examiners to apply informed judgments in the identif ication of \nemerging risks and unsound banking strategies.  \n         \n \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n0.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.5\nTraditional Security Holdings Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchases\nLong Term Treasury Purchases Lending to Financial Institutions and Credit MarketsRapid Expansion in the Federal Reserve \nBalance Sheet  \nBear Stearns Failure  QE1 QE2 $ Trillions  \nSource:  Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland – Credit Easing Policy Tool  QE3 Chart 1  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \nBank Deposits Have Surged Since the Crisis * \n7.30  \n0.01.02.03.04.05.06.07.08.0$ Trillions  \n* Excludes Time Deposits  \nSource:  Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 2  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n3.20%  \n3.0%3.2%3.4%3.6%3.8%4.0%4.2%4.4%% of Average Earning Assets  Bank Net Interest Margins Have Declined  \nNotes: Net interest margin is measured as interest income net of interest expense (YTD), as a percentage of average earning a ssets - annualized.   \nSource: Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 3  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \nLeveraged Loan Issuance Surpasses  \n2007 Peak  \nSource:  S&P Capital IQ/LCD  Chart 4  \nPro Rata  \nInstitutional  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n2005  \n2005  2006  \n2006  2007  \n2007  2008  \n2008  2009  \n2009  2010  \n2010  2011  \n2011  2012  \n2012  Sep-13 \nSep-13 \n0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%\nUnder 3 Years Over 3 YearsIncreased Holdings of Longer -Term \nSecurities & Loans  \n(Commercial Banks Under $50 Billion)  \nSource:  Reports of Condition and Income  % of Total Securities & Loans  \n48%  63%  \n52%  \n37%  Chart 5  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n18.7%  \n-5%0%5%10%15%20%25%30%\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Annual Percentage Increase in Midwest \nFarmland Values  \n% Change From Previous Year  \n* Non -irrigated Farmland  \nSource: Kansas City Federal Reserve’s quarterly Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions  Chart 6  \n\n FEDERAL  RESERVE  BANK of KANSAS  CITY \n59.5%  \n50%55%60%65%70%75%80%Risk-Weighted Assets at the Ten Largest \nU.S. BHCs  \nNotes: Depending on the year, the chart excludes MetLife and foreign BHCs.  \nSource: Reports of Condition and Income  Chart 7  \n% of Total Assets",

        "content": "Structure  Matters:  The Decentralized  Federal  Reserve  \n \n \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Exchequer Club  \nWashington, D.C.  \nMay 21, 2014  \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those  of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives . \n\n1 \n An “End the Fed” demonstration  took place  outside  my office  last Saturday  on Main  \nStreet  in Kansas  City,  Missouri.  It was a reminder  that democracy  demands  accountability  from  \nits most  powerful  institutions  to its citizens.  The Federal  Reserve  is no exception.  \nIn my role as president  of a regional  Reserve  Bank, I am well aware  of the range  of views  \non the topic  of Federal  Reserve  accountability.  I’d like to share  with you some  comments  I read \nrecently.  For example,  one commentator  wrote  that even  if the central  bank’s “power  would  \nremain  in the hands  of the wisest,  the most  honorable,  and the most  disinterested”  leaders,  “it \nwould  not be possible  to satisfy  the people  throughout  the country  that the vast resources  and \npowers  of the bank  were  used only for the best interests  of all the people  and without  partiality  or \nfavor  to any section  of the country,  or to any class  or set of people....”1 When  it comes  to the \nnation’ s financial  matters,  someone  else noted  that authority  should  not be “concentrated  in one \ncity where  a small  clique  could  control  the system.”2  \n Yet another  comment  stated  that, “The business  resources  of the United  States...cannot  be \ncentralized . ...By  reason  of the great  expanse  of the country  and the diversity  of business  \nconditions  in the different  sections  of the country,  the details  of the business  of a central  bank  \ncould  not be managed  at a central  office.”3 Finally,  the desire  for local  control  was highlighted  in \nthis comment:  “No centralized  power  could  dominate  an organism  whose  life is drawn  from  \nfunctions  local to each community.”4  \n The sentiments  behind  these  words—concerns  about  power  and the conc entration  of \nfinancial  resources —ring true, but they are not in fact comments  on the recent  financial  crisis.  \nThis commentary  offers  a flavor  of the robust  and contentious  public  debate  that preceded  the \n                                                 \n1 Victor  Morawetz,  The Banking  and Currency  Problem  in the United  States . 1909  \n2 Robert  Owen.  The Federal  Reserve  Act. 1919.  \n3 “Doubts  Money  Plan.” The New York  Times . December  3, 1911.  \n4 Pamphlet  produced  by the Nationa l Citizens  League,  circa  1912 . \n\n2 \n signing  of the Federal  Reserve  Act in 1913.  It is striking  to me how familiar  those  words  are \ntoday.  It was this public sentiment  about  the country’ s economic  future  under  a central  bank  that \ninfluenced  Congress  to shape  the institution  in a way that would  garner  the trust and confidence  \nof the American  public. The result  was a decentralized  structure  that exists  today  with locations  \nacross  the country  operating  under  a rigorous  system  of checks  and balances.  \n  As a career  Federal  Reserve  employee,  bank  supervisor  and lifelong  Missourian,  I \nunderstand  the importance  of having  a central  bank  that is accountable  to the public.  In fact, as \nan official  with input  to national  policy  who lives  and works  in the center  of the United  States,  \nmy role is not happenstance , but rather  it is a deliberate  choice  on the part of the Federal  \nReserve’ s congressional  founders  that reflects  their intentions  for the structure  of the nation’s \ncentral  bank.  It is my view  that the Federal  Reserve’ s ability  to achieve  its broad  objectives  over \nthe past century  has been  possible  because  of its decentralized  structure.  The key role that the \nFederal  Reserve’ s structure  plays  in achieving  its mandates  is the focus  of my comments  today.  \n \nStructure  enhances  public  trust  \nThe Federal  Reserve  Act established  a framework  for the nation’s central  bank  that \ndeparted  materially  from  that of the First and Second  Banks  of the United  States.  Congress  \nrightly  understood  that the monolithic  structure  of these  first two centr al banks  was ill-suited  to \nrepresent  and serve  the diverse  interests,  geographies  and industries  that make  up the U.S. \neconomy.  The central  bank’s founders  understood  that the long-term success  and credibility  of \nthe institution  would  rely on its ability  to gain support  outside  the Washington -New  York  \ncorridor  of political  and financial  interests.   \n\n3 \n  To ensure  public  accountability,  the Federal  Reserve  Act called  for a government  \nagency—the Board  of Governors  in Washington,  D.C.—comp osed of individuals  who are \nnominated  by the president  and confirmed  by the Senate  to serve  14-year terms.  The Board  of \nGovernors  plays  an important  public  oversight  role for the entire  system,  without  which  a \nmeaningful  role for the quasi -governmental  regional  Reserve  Banks  would  not likely  be \nacceptable  to the public.  However,  to ensure  there  was appropriate  balance  and representation,  \nthe Act also called  for between  eight  and 12 Reserve  Banks  to be located  across the country.  A \ncommittee  of cabinet  members  took several  months  to arrive  at its decision  to name  the 12 \nFederal  Reserve  cities  that would  serve  as the regional  arms  of the nation’s central  bank.   \nOne hundred  years  ago this week,  on May 18, 1914,  a delegation  signed  paperwork  to \nincorporate  the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City.  Similar  meetings  were  held that spring  in \n11 other  cities,  and the Fede ral Reserve  System  began  operations  on Nov.  16, 1914.   \n Each  Reserve  Bank  is overseen  by a local  Board  of Directors  composed  of community  \nand business  leaders  from  diverse  sectors  across  each of the 12 regions.  These  directors  share  \ngovernance  responsibili ty for Reserve  Bank  operations  along  with the Board  of Governors.  \n In addition  to Reserve  Bank  boards,  individuals  serve  as directors  on the boards  at 24 \nFederal  Reserve  branch  offices.  All told, some  270 individuals  across  the country  serve  as \nFederal  Reserve directors,  providing  real-time economic  information  for the Federal  Reserve  to \nconsider  in its policy  formulation.  In addition,  through  their experiences  as leaders  in business,  \nand in the labor,  consumer,  banking  and agriculture  sectors , directors  offer an independent  \nperspective  on Reserve  Bank  operations,  budgetary  issues  and other  strategic  challenges.   \n  \n \n\n4 \n Structure  improves  operational  effectiveness  \n Over  the past century,  the Federal  Reserve’s local  connections  have  proven  to be valuable  \nin carrying  out its responsibilities.  Whether  responding  to a crisis,  delivering  financial  services,  \nor supervising  banks,  the deep  understanding  of regional  interests  has facilitated  effective  \noperational  performance.   \n Importantly,  the Reserve  Banks  are designed  to understand  credit  availability  issues  at the \nlocal  level.  You need  not go back  to 1913  to find an example  that underscores  this. As financial  \nmarkets  seized  up during  the most  recent  crisis,  the Board  of Governors  and the Federal  Reserve  \nBank  of New York  focused  their efforts  and resources  on designing  liquidity  facilities  to ease \nfinancial  conditions.  Even  as resources  were  dedicated  to pulling  Wall  Street  out of the depths  of \nthe financial  panic,  problems  developed  in other  parts  of the country  that needed  to be addressed,  \nincluding  in the Kansas  City Fed’s region.  \nAmong  the roles  served  by the regional  reserve  banks  is the statutory  responsibility  to act \nas a “lender  of last resort”  to depository  institutions  in the region.  Specifically,  the Fede ral \nReserve  is charged  with lending  against  collateral  to solvent  institutions,  making  its role as a \nbank  supervisor  complementary  to the ability  to confirm  eligibility  to borrow  on short  notice.  In \nthe case of the Kansas  City Fed, serving  as a lender  of last resort  across  its seven -state region  \nmeans  leveraging  relationships  and access  to information  on thousands  of institutions.  This \ninformation  is a particularly  critical  resource  during  crisis  situations.  During  the crisis  of 2008,  \nthe monthly  volume  of discount  window  borrowing  from  the Federal  Reserve  spiked  from  less \nthan $1 billion  pre-crisis  to a high of more  than $400  billion.5  \n                                                 \n5 See http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DISCBORR .  \n\n5 \n As funding  from  Wall  Street  dried  up in 2009,  the effects  rippled  across  the country.  In \nmy district,  a sizable  and health y financial  services  firm lost access  to its line of credit  from  a \nlarge  Wall  Street  bank.  While  this regional  institution  would  not be considered  systemically  \nimportant  by today’s regulatory  definition,  it certainly  played  an important  role in the economy  \nof its own Midwestern  community.  \nStaff at the Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City worked  closely  with the Board  of \nGovernors ’ staff to consider  the firm’ s qualifications  to gain timely  access  to funding  and avoid  \nfailure.  The firm survived  the crisis  because the local  Reserve  Bank  was familiar  with the \ninstitution  and was able to connect  it with programs  that allowed  this otherwise  viable  firm to \ncontinue  its vital operations.  \nLikewise,  the regional  Reserve  Bank  is able to gauge  the local  effects  of financial  market  \nconditions  and economic  drivers  through  its role in supervising  banks.  Although  considerable  \nattention  is focused  today  on systemic  risk and systemically  important  financial  institutions,  the \nFederal  Reserve’s regional  connections  to more  than 6,000  community  banks  and 50 state \nbanking  departments  provide  essential  information  about  the economic  health  of small  business,  \nregional  economies,  credit  conditions  and the impact  of broader  regulatory  issues.   \nThrough  the Reserve  Banks’ presence  in their respective  communities,  regional  issues  \ncan be addressed  with the expertise  and knowledge  that a regional  Reserve  Bank  is equipped  to \nprovide.  Having  been  so recently  reminded  that access  to credit  is critical  to the economic  \nsuccess  for communitie s large  and small,  I think  it is quite  feasible  that if Congress  were  to \ndesign  the Federal  Reserve  System  today,  it might  well choose  to have  50 Reserve  Banks  rather  \nthan just 12. \n \n\n6 \n Structure  fosters  independent  thinking  \nThe system,  by design,  is intended  to include  a diverse  range  of perspectives,  and the \nReserve  Banks  contribute  importantly  to this diversity.  Many  have  criticized  this feature  by \nsuggesting  that the cacophony  of voices  sends  mixed  signals.  Yet, other  public  institutions  reflect  \nsimilar  democratic  processes  where  a mosaic  of perspectives  and input  is sometimes  messy.  \nEssential  to sound  outcomes  are leadership  and governing  processes  to bring  these  voices  \ntogether  for the purpose  of decision  making.  The same  is true for the Federal  Open  Marke t \nCommittee  (FOMC).  \n The FOMC  has a long-established  process  that provides  for discussion  and debate  of \npolicy  options.  But, the decision -making  process  is quite  clear:  12 participants —seven  from  the \nBoard  of Governors  and five from  the Reserve  Banks—cast votes  at each meeting  and the \nmajority  defines  the policy  action  with a statement  articulating  its rationale.  A $17 trillion  \neconomy  with complex  dynamics  is well-served  by this process,  which  includes  a range  of \nviewpoints  and inputs.  \n This structure  also, by design,  allows  for dissenting  views.  This feature  recognizes  the \nvalue  Americans  place  on independent  thinking.  Some  have  argued:  Why  not keep  differing  \nviews  internal  and present  a united  or consensus  view  to the public?  Woul dn’t solidarity  give \nmore  confidence  and clarity  to the public?  I believe  that masking  differing  policy  views  is \ninconsistent  with central  bank  communication  and transparency.  Making  differing  views  \navailable  to the public  serves  to clarify  issues.  It is the public  duty of each participant  of the \nFOMC  to express  their views.  To suggest  that FOMC  members  should  appear  to be unanimous  \nin voting  records  is to suggest  that diverse  perspectives  are not valued  and underestimates  the \npublic’s ability  to discern  intellectual  honesty.  \n\n7 \n Final ly, independent,  stable  and informed  leadership  is especially  important  to the \nFederal  Reserve’s policymaking  process.  Policy  decisions  have  broad  impact  and benefit  from  \nthe institution ’s research,  thoughtful  analysis and public  input.  Experience  and informed  \njudgment  are as important  to good  policy  as academic  and theoretical  frameworks.  \nThe Federal  Reserve  Act calls for members  of the Board  of Governors  to serve  14-year \nterms,  yet according  to one recent  report,  the average  tenure  of Federal  Reserve  gove rnors  since  \n1936  has been  7.3 years.  Since  1986,  the average  tenure  has fallen  to five years,  and the last 10 \ngovernors  to serve  have  held their seats  on average  for four years.6 Furthermore,  whether  \nmonetary  policy,  banking  regulation  or payments,  the public depends  on those  who serve  to \nbring  diversity  of experience  to the Federal  Reserve’s most  challenging  issues . This means  \nhonoring  the Federal  Reserve  Act’s requirement  for diversity  of background  and geography  \namong  the Governors.  Consistent  with this, I agree  that the Federal  Reserve  Board  would  be \nstrengthened  by having  someone  with community  banking  or community  bank  supervision  \nexperience  to fill one of its current  openings.   \n \nConclusion  \n The financial  crisis  is behind  us, thankfully,  but not far behind.  The image  in the rearview  \nmirror  is still large—and perhaps  closer—than it appears.  The Federal  Reserve’s history  is \nimportant , but it is only helpful  to the extent  that it positions  us to consider  how we might  \naddress  the considerable  challenges  that await  the central  bank  in the years  to come.  Those  \nchallenges  include  normalizing  monetary  policy,  effectively  supervising  the largest  financial  \ninstitutions,  and ensuring  a safe, efficient  and accessible  payments  system.   \n                                                 \n6 The New York  Times . “Tenures Becoming  Shor ter at a Short -Handed  Fed.” May 12, 2014.   \n\n8 \n Today's debate  is not about  second -guessing  those  who made  difficult  choices  in the \ninterest  of the country  during  the depths  of the financial  crisis.  However,  it is not enough  to \ndefend  the steps  taken  during  the crisis  by saying , “It could  have  been  worse.”  Instead,  the \nexperience  of the financial  crisis  should  lead policymakers  to the unequivocal  conviction  that \nthey will not rest until the foundations  of our financial  system  are shored  up to avoid  similar  \noutcomes  next time.  That is the pledge  policymakers  made  to the Ame rican  public. Through  the \nbroad -based  input  provided  by the decentralized  Federal  Reserve,  we can deliver  on this pledge.  \nThose  demonstrating  on Main  Street  in Kansas  City and other  parts  of the country  deserve  this. \nThe Federal  Reserve’s  centennial  provides  an oppo rtunity  to engage  the public  and to \nreflect  on the values  that have  allowed  the institution  to serve  the country.7 Its defining  \ncharacteristics,  if embraced,  can continue  to serve  as a source  of strength  for the nation  in the \nfuture.  As former  Senator  Robe rt Owen  noted  in an Octo ber 1913  speech  on the role of Reserve  \nBanks within  the Federal  Reserve  System,  “Their  function  must  be to protect  the commerce  of \nthe nation,  to stabilize  the interest  rate and to give permanency  to the prosperity  which  this \ncountr y ought  to enjoy  continuously.”   \nThat sentiment  is as true today  as it was 100 years  ago. \n                                                 \n7For more  on the Federal  Reserve’s centennial,  visit the System’s historical  gateway  at \nhttp://www.federalreservehistory.org/ .",

It is an honor to address such a \ndistinguished group on an important topic. Given the events of the past several years, this \nconference’s focus on “Frameworks for Cen tral Banking in the Next Century” is certainly  fitting.  \nCentral banks are grappling to apply the lessons of history in the context of today’s economic \nrealities, and I expect this forum will contribute importantly to that essential evolution.   \nOne issue that the crisis has pushed to the forefront is the relationship between \nmacroeconomics and finance, and how we think about the footings of financial stability . My \ncomments this evening will focus briefly on this intersection of monetary policy an d supervisory \nand regulatory issues. I am convinced that promoting financial stability requires a comprehensive  \napproach that uses both macroprudential tools and the examination of individual firms, relying \non the judgment of experienced examiners. In addi tion, I am skeptical of a clean “separation \nprinciple” that places financial stability squarely in the purview of the supervisors. Instead, I \nthink monetary policymakers also need to maintain a careful eye on the financial system and \nhow interest rate poli cy affects incentives for financial markets and institutions.  \nAs usual, my comments today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nThe path of policy and incentives  \nA primary  mission of financial regulators and supervisors is to foster financial stability \nby monitoring the health of individual financial institutions.  Broader financial conditions also \nplay an important role in achieving these objectives.  In some respects, financial institutions are \nstronger today than prior to the crisis, but I remain concerned about how the stance of monetary \npolicy is affecting the ir incentives and attitudes toward risk.  As a result of near-zero interest rates \n\n \n2 \n for five years , the profitab ility of traditional banking activities is strained  and incentives to reach \nfor yield are tempting . Net interest margins continue to trend lower and are at their lowest level \nin 30 years . Banks are responding as we should expect , which is to say they are engaging in \nriskier activities. For example, an all -time high of  $600 billion of  leveraged loans were issue d in \n2013. This lending is often characterized by weaker underwriting standards, including higher \ndebt ratios and fewer covenant provisions.  \nThe incentives to reach for yield extend to smaller financial institutions  as well . \nCommercial banks with assets of less than $50 billion have increased exposure to interest rate \nrisk, due in part to the guidance the FOMC has provided regarding future interest rates. Today, \n53 percent  of the securities and loans held by these banks have maturities of more than three \nyears, compared to about 37  percent  back in 2005. If longer -term interest rates we re to suddenly \nmove higher, the se institutions could face heavy losses.  These conditions create a challenging \nclimate for supervisors. Not only are they implement ing many new rules associated with \nregulatory reform , but they also are monitor ing these and other areas of increased risk -taking.    \nHaving just painted a picture where the extended, low-rate environment adversely affects \ntraditional banking activities,  the question is , What steps might be taken to address it and its \neffects?  \nFirst,  I would like to  see short -term interest rates move higher in response to improving \neconomic conditions  shortly after completion of the “taper.”  Many of the rules offering policy \nguidance on the federal funds rate —such as the “Taylor rule”  and its variants —are already or \nclose to prescribing a po licy rate higher than the current funds rate.  Second, the path toward the \nlonger -term neutral funds  should be gradual.  Given the lengthy period of unconventional policy \nand low rates, the necessary adjustment by financial markets to less central bank intervention and \n\n \n3 \n influence could be volatile.  In this environment, the pressure to quickly back away from a rising \nrate pol icy will be significant ; such pressures will need to be resisted. If not, we risk moving into \na confusing stop -and-go policy environment.  \nIn terms of the path after liftoff, the FOMC has signaled that it will take a gradual \napproach toward  the longer -run funds rate . For example,  the median of the latest FOMC \nSummary of Economic Projections  shows the economy reach ing full employment an d inflation \nat the 2 percent  target at the end of 2016. Such conditions, under more normal circumstances, \nwould imply the federal funds rate should be at, or at least near, its longer -run level.  However, \nthe federal funds rate is expected to be 2¼ percent by year -end 2016, compared to a median of 4 \npercent in the longer run. So, the funds rate could reach its lo nger-run level well after the \neconomic recovery is complete and inflation has returned to the 2 percent  goal.  \nThese signals suggest to banks  that they will  continue to contend with a low interest rate \nenvironment for a few years, even as economic conditions are lik ely to improve. I see this as a \nset of conditions ripe for greater risk -taking  as firms reach for yield and the imbalances related to \nsuch incentives  grow .  \nGradualism can promote financial stability, as it reduces the incidence of unexpe cted \nshifts in interest rates.  Even so, t he degree of inertia suggested in the median path of the federal \nfunds rate in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections goes beyond what is required to \nachieve  a smooth exit.  In my view,  it will likely be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate at a \nsomewhat faster pace than the median of committee members’ projections. Low rates into late \n2016 will likely continue to provide incentives for financial markets and investors to reach for \nyield in an economy operating at full capacity and risks achieving our objectives  over the longer \nrun. \n\n \n4 \n  \nA comprehensive approach to supervision  \n Given this landscape, how can bank supervisors respond? I will begin here by noting that  \nsubstantial effort s have been devoted to enhanced macroprudential supervision and requirements \naimed at strengthening bank balance sheets. Higher leverage ratios, liquidity requirements, stress \ntests and enhanced supervision of systemically important financial institutions  are designed to \ncontribute to a more stable financial system in the future.  However, our experience with these \ntools and the model -driven approaches when  evaluating the balance sheet s of large financial \ninstitution s is limited . For example, c ounter -cyclical capital buffers lack a type of “Taylor rule” \nthat would help guide us on when to make adjustments.  Absent a rule  for guidance , knowing the \nright time to adjust the buffers and by how much pose considerable challenges.   \n I would also note that a number of central banks did engage in a form of macroprudential \nsupervision before the crisis through their Financial Stability Reports.  Overall, these reports \nshow that potential risks were identified before the crisis, but it was far more dif ficult for central \nbanks to judge whether these risks would be fully realized and to then pursue corrective \nsupervisory action in an effective and timely manner.   \n Until we better understand how to utilize such tools, macroprudential supervision and the \nidentification of systemic risk can be most effective when it serves as a complement to a rigorous \nmicroprudential regime. Assessing risk-management policies and governance offer s a window \ninto the incentives that drive decision -making and risk appetite  at the level of an individual firm, \nproviding important context for macro views of the system.  \nEnhanced supervision over the past few years has focused more heavily on the role of \nquantitative models  rather than experienced bank examiners.  These contributions surely have \n\n \n5 \n been important complements to the supervisory regime.  But they are  not a substitute  for the \nperspectives of bank examiners . Macroprudential tools take a different approach to the \nsupervisory process than a commissioned bank examin er in two ways:  The credentialing  process \nfor examiners involves hands -on experience and assigns accountability to the findings of an \nexamination.  Early training includes classroom time in addition to work on bank analysis and \ntransaction testing.  Once an examiner is credentialed , that person can be the Examiner -in-Charge \n(EIC) . As the EIC, you sign the exam ination  report. And when you sign the examination report , \nyou are  accountable for the judgments and assessments contained in the report . \nI take a similar approach to monetary policy. Economic analysis from my staff provides a \nuseful high -level overview of economic trends and issue s relevant  to monetary policy. I feel \nmost confident when their analysis is consistent with anecdotes from my contacts , who are  \noperating businesses and making real -time hiring and pricing decisions. The macro view \ncomplements the micro information, and vice vers a. In the same way, this dynamic applies to \nfinancial supervision . \nThus, an effective supervisory framework blends the new quantitative macrosupervisory \napproaches with the qualitative judgments that supervisors  bring from examining individual \nfirms. So , as we experiment with macroprudential tools, we also must c ontinue t o devote \nresources to and emphasize microprudential supervision.  In addition, strengthening bank capital \nwith sturdier and higher leverage ratios is a n essential and prudent course of action. Recent \nchanges along these lines are encouraging. For example, I  see the enhanced supplementary \nleverage ratio as a positive step that avoids relying on risk -based capital standards, which can be \nexploited.  \n \n\n \n6 \n  \nConclusion  \nCertainly , the frameworks for central banking in the future are evolving and include all of \nthe topics being discussed during this conference.  They also will require a healthy dose of \nthinking —and humility —about the interaction between regulatory and interest rate p olicy if \nsustainable economic growth is to be achieved.  Interest rate policy needs to adjust to achieve \nprice stability and sustainable growth, both now and in the future. However, we have seen how \nasset bubbles can derail these goals . Finding the intersec tion of supervisory and interest rate \npolicy to achieve financial stability will be an important contribution to central banking in the \nnext century.",

        "content": "Community  Bank  Regulation:  Intent  vs. Reality  \n \nEsther  L. George  \nPresident  and Chief  Executive  Officer  \nFederal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCommunity  Banking  in the 21st Century  \nConference  hosted  by the Federal  Reserve  System  and the Conference  of State  Bank  Supervisors  \nSt. Louis,  Mo. \nSept.  23, 2014  \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, \nits governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n1 \n It is a pleasure  to be invited  to participate  in today’s  conference.  The Kansas  City Fed’s  \nseven -state district  is home  to some  900 banks  with less than $1 billion  of assets,  which  is 17 \npercent  of the nation’s  small  banks.  With  combined  assets  of about  $150  billion,  these  banks \nrepresent  just 1 percent  of total industry  assets.  However,  size comparisons  understate  their \nimport ant contribution  to the region al and nation al economy.   \nCommunity  banks  in our region  help finance  farmers  who contribute  to 12 percent  of the \nnation’s  agricultural  output  as well as oil and gas businesses  that account  for 16 percent  of \ndomestic  energy  output.  These  banks  also are particularly  critical  for home owners  and business  \noperators  in rural  areas  because  of their willingness  to meet  the demand  for tailored,  nonstandard  \nmortgages  and for small  business  loans.   \nThere  are more  than 5,000  such banks  in the United  States.  As the national  economy  \nstrengthens,  community  banks  are prepared  to resume  their important  role in their communities  \nand the broader  economy.   However,  they argue  that the regulatory  environment  has thrown  sand \nin the gears  of efficiently  and competitively  meeting  the credit  needs  of their communities.   \nFour  years  ago, the regulatory  reform  known  as the Dodd -Frank  Act (DFA)  was passed.  \nWith  its aim squarely  focused  on addressing  the supervision  and regulation  of the largest  \nfinancial  institutions,  the law and its architects  acknowledged  that small  banks  were  neither  the \ncause  of the crisis  nor the target  of reforms.  And to that end, the DFA  expressly  exempted  small  \nbanks  from  its reach.  So, why since  then have  community  banks  increasingly  become  concerned  \nand vocal  about  regulatory  burden  as a threat  to their ability  to serve  the credit  needs  of their \ncommunities  and, ultimately,  to their viability?   \nThis growing  chorus  of concern  and frustration  about  regulatory  burden  has gotten  the \nattention  of policymakers  and regulators.  Federal  banking  regulators  all agree  that calibrating  \n\n2 \n supervision  for community  banks  is appropriate  and important,  and they express  genuine  \nsympathy  for the need  to apply  the right  balance  to the supervision  and regulation  of small  \nbanks.   \nYet, in spite  of legislators’  and regulators’  best intentions,  customers  and communities  \nthat rely on smaller  banks  for access  to credit  are feeling  the weight  of regulatory  burden,  and \nbankers  are pleading  for relief.  Industry  advocates  have  identified  a number  of specific  remedies,  \nand efforts  are underway  to consider  how they might  be implemented.  For its part, the Federal  \nReserve  has likewise  expressed  its commitment  to a deeper  understanding  of these  issues,  \nincluding  its partnership  with the Conference  of State  Bank  Supervisors  in this forum  today.  I \ncommend  such efforts  and look forward  to the research  insights  and other  learning  from  this \nprogram.   \nIn my remarks  today,  I will offer  my own views  on the regulatory  burden  dilemma  facing  \nsmall  banks,  their regulators  and legislators,  and why it is proving  to be so difficult  to address  in \na meaningful  way.  I will also offer  my perspective  on a way forward  to ensure  that regulation  \nretains  its objectives  for public  interest  and the safety  of the banking  system.  Before  going  \nfurther,  I need  to note that my comments  today  are my views  only and not those  of the Federal  \nReserve  System  or its Board  of Governors,  which  is charged  with bank  regulation  \nresponsibilities.  \n \nThe aim of regulation  \nThe aim of bank  regulation  in the United  States  is both to protect  the public  and foster  an \nefficient  competitive  banking  system.  Similar  to the backdrop  for the DFA,  much  of the U.S. \nregulatory  system  developed  in response  to financial  crises  and other  events.   \n\n3 \n Generally  speaking,  bank  regulation  is designed  to protect  depositors,  ensure  monetary  \nand financial  stability,  provide  for an efficient  and competitive  financial  system  and protect  \nconsumers.  It is not intended  to keep  banks  from  failing  or to hinder  banks  from  taking  risks  in \nmeeting  the needs  of their customers  and efficiently  allocating  credit.1   \nStriking  an appropriate  balance  between  regulation,  banking  and policy  has always  been  \na struggle.   In that regard,  today’s  environment  is no different.  Tension  has long existed  between  \nallowing  banks  suffic ient flexibility  to adapt  to a rapidly  changing  environment  while  \nmaintaining  a regulatory  framework  that ensures  financial  stability  and adequate  consumer  \nprotection.   \nGetting  that balance  right  is critical.  History  offers  any number  of examples  of well-\nintended  regulation  resulting  in unintended  outcomes.  For example,  the 1999  Gramm -Leach -\nBliley  Act that allowed  banking  organizations  to expand  into nonbank  financial  activities  aimed  \nto allow  banks  to diversify  and reduce  risk. Instead,  as we learned  from  the financial  crisis,  \nsubstantial  increases  in risk-taking,  leverage  and business -model  complexity  increased  financial  \nfragility.   \nLikewise,  the Basel  capital  requirements  allowed  the largest  banks  to use internal  models  \nto calculate  their own risk weights  for risk-based  capital  requirements,  in part, “to build  upon  and \nfurther  encourage  investments  banks  are already  making  in their internal  risk management  \nsystems.”2 While  the intent  was to improve  risk management  and better  align  capital  ratios  with \nportf olio risk, the result  was regulatory  arbitrage  and leverage  ratios  that proved  inadequate  \nrelative  to the risks  that many  of the largest  banks  took leading  into the crisis.    \n                                                 \n1 For an in-depth  review  of the purposes  of bank  regulation  as well as what  bank  regulation  is not intended  to do, see \nKenneth  Spong,  Banking  Regulation:  Its Purposes,  Implementation,  and Effects , Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Kansas  \nCity,  2000.  \n2 See William  J. McDonough,  “Implementing  the New  Basel  Accord,” remarks  to the Global  Association  of Risk \nProfessionals,  Feb. 11, 2003.  \n\n4 \n Getting  the right  balance  for banking  regulation  is not easy.  Legislators  and regulators  \nface the growing  challenge  of regulating  an industry  that over the past three  decades  has become  \nhighly  concentrated  and engaged  in activities  that range  from  traditional  lending  to complex  \nfinance.  While  commercial  banks  of all sizes  benefit  from  public  safety  nets, the operating  \nmodels,  activities,  and risk profiles  they employ  vary widely.  Indeed,  community  banks  are not \nsmaller  versions  of the country’s  largest  banks.  If our regulatory  apparatus  is going  to effectively  \nmeet  its aims,  policymaker s must  understand  how these  commercial  banking  business  models  \noperate  and why a locally -owned  community  bank  is not the same  as a branch  of a systemically  \nimportant  financial  institution  in meeting  the credit  needs  of the local  community.   \n \nUnderstanding  relationship  banking  \nThe community  bank  business  model  is often  described  as relationship  banking.  \nCommunity  bankers  typically  have  long-term,  direct  relationships  with their customers  that \nprovide  the detailed  knowledge  about  their character,  reputation  and history.  This is necessary  to \nmake  informed,  qualitative  assessments  about  credit  quality.  These  relationships  allow  \ncommunity  banks  to tailor  loans  and other  services  to their customers.   \n Many  community  banks  also are closely  held institutions  with the top management  and \nboard  members  having  significant  ownership  positions.  These  ownership  incentives  shape  the \nbank’s  culture  and help to ensure  that its key policymakers  are focused  on achieving  good  \nperformance,  avoiding  excessive  risk-taking,  and suppo rting  the health  of their communities.  \nStudies  by staff at our Reserve  Bank  on ownership  and management  structure  find that the \n\n5 \n better -performing  and safer  community  banks  are those  where  the major  decision  makers  have  \nmuch  to lose if they do not make  the right  decisions.3   \nI often  hear that such a business  model  is becoming  less economical  in a world  that is fast \npaced  and increasingly  transactions -based.  However,  research  from  our Reserve  Bank  presented  \nhere at last year’s  conference  shows  there  is real value  in relationship  lending  and in the soft \npersonal  information  on customers  that community  bankers  typically  have.4 This business  model  \nis one in which  the incentives  of banks  are aligned  with outcomes  that benefit  their customers  \nand the economy.  When  incentives  are aligned  in this way,  the need  for an “ability  to repay”  \nrule, for example,  seems  unnecessary.   \nAnother  defining  feature  of community  banking  is its business  model  transparency.  \nTraditional  bank  lending  is inherently  opaque  because  it is based on the inside,  non-public  \ninformation  that bankers  gain from  their relationships  with borrowers,  but the business  model  \nneed  not be opaque.  In contrast  to the largest  banks,  community  bank  shareholders,  creditors,  \ncustomers  and regulators  find it relati vely easy to monitor  and verify  risks.  Management  \noversight  and market  discipline  are much  more  effective  with such a transparent  business  model.  \nEmployees  know  what  is expected;  regulators  are better  able to thoroughly  examine  the bank,  \nidentify  risks  and recommend  appropriate  corrective  actions  as needed.  \nFinally,  to understand  the community  bank  business  model  is to understand  that failure  is \nan option  when  risks  are poorly  managed.  This feature  offers  a powerful  incentive  to manage  \nrisk. To be sure,  community  banks  don’t  always  get it right,  and history  points  to their failures,  \n                                                 \n3 Robert  DeYoung,  Kenneth  Spong,  Richard  J.

Fortunately,  an efficient  resolution  process  is \navailable  to minimize  the cost to their communities  and customers,  maintain  essential  banking  \nservices  and retain  public  confidence.  \n \nThe reality  of the current  regulatory  environment  \nThe business  model  of community  banks  no longer  dominates  the commercial  banking  \nindustry.  Regulation  has expanded  to address  the size, concentration  and complexity  of the \nlargest  banks.  Unfortunately,  it also has impinged  on thousands  of community  and regional  \nbanks.    \nThe issue  is whether  we can effectively  achieve  desired  outcomes  for all commercial  \nbanks  under  the current  regulatory  framework,  or whether  we will try to further  bifurcate  the \nsystem  with separate  rules  for the largest  banks  and community  banks.  We face a decision  about  \nthe path forward.  Based  on my own experience,  I would  offer  three  observations  about  the nature  \nof today’s  regulatory  environment  that weigh  most  heavily  on community  banks  in the interest  of \nframing  potential  remedies.    \nMy first observation  is that the rules  are increasingly  prescriptive  and complex.  In a \nglobal  market  for finance  and commerce,  regulators  have  responded  to a larger,  more  \nconcentrated  and complex  banking  industry  with more  complicated  rules.  However,  the value  of \nthis complexity  is questionable.  In the case of capital  rules—a key component  of regulation  and \nbank  safety—recent  empirical  and theoretical  research  shows  that simpler  capital  rules  are better.  \nFor example,  researchers  at the Bank  of England  and Organisation  for Economic  Cooperation  \nand Development  have  shown  that simple  leverage  ratios  are better  than risk-based  ratios  in \n\n7 \n predicting  default.5 Researchers  at the Bank  of England  also have  shown  that theoretically  \ncomplicated  rules  can lead to worse  results  when  granular  measures  of asset  risk do not account  \nfor correlations  among  a bank’s  asset  portfolio  or when  models  attempt  to estimate  risk \nparameters  for risks  that are unknowable.6 \nLong  before  Basel  III was adopted,  community  banks  were  considered  well capitalized  \nand their risks  well understood.  They  remain  so today.  For example,  banks  with less than $1 \nbillion  of assets  had a Tier 1 leverage  ratio of 9.5 percent  in 1996,  and today  it is 10.5 percent.  \nEven  so, community  banks  must  adopt  the more  complicated  capital  rules  with finer  degrees  of \nrisk weights  and capital  buffers.  The risk-weighted  asset  schedule  of the call report  has 57 rows  \nand 89 pages  of instructions  yet no additional  capital  was required  for the majority  of community  \nbanks.  \nIn addition  to the higher  compliance  costs  associated  with these  capital  rules,  community  \nbanks  continue  to hold higher  levels  of capital  than the largest  banks. Unless  and until the largest  \nbanks  achieve  commensurate  levels  of capital  (inclusive  of their off-balance -sheet  assets),  they \nretain  a capital -ratio advantage  over community  and regional  banks  that is far more  powerful  \nthan the funding  cost subsidy  confirmed  in a recent  Government  Accountability  Office  study.   \nMy second  observation  is that regulation  and supervisory  frameworks  have  evolved  with \nfar less reliance  on examiner  experience  and supervisory  judgment  and more  emphasis  on data-\ndriven,  econometr ic models  and measurement  to produce  a more  systematic,  objective  and \n                                                 \n5 See Andrew  Haldane,  “Constraining  Discretion  in Bank  Regulation ,” Federal  Reserve  Bank  of Atlanta  Conference  \non “Maintaining  Financial  Stability:  Holding  a Tiger  by the Tail(s),”  April  9, 2013 ; and Adrian  Blundell -Wignall,  \nPaul Atkinson,  and Caroline  Roulet,  “Bank  Business  Models  and the Basel  System : Complexity  and \nInterconnectedness ,” OECD  Journal:  Financial  Market  Trends , Vol. 2014  – Issue  2. \n6 See Andrew  Haldane  in note 5 and David  Aikman,  Mirta  Galesic,  Gerd  Gigerenzer,  Sujit  Kapadia,  \nKonstantinos  Katsikopoulos,  Amit  Kothiyal,  Emma  Murphy,  and Tobias  Neumann,  “Taking  Uncertainty  Seriously:  \nSimplicity  Versus  Complexity  in Financial  Regulation ,” Financial  Stability  Paper  No. 28, Bank  of England,  May \n2014.   \n \n\n8 \n standardized  approach  to supervision.  For the enhanced  supervision  of the country’s  largest  \nbanks,  this approach  has been  considered  highly  successful,  for example,  in making  assessments  \nabout  capital  adequacy  under  stress  test scenarios.  However,  for community  bank  supervision,  \nthe substitution  of rigid  rules  for examiner  judgment  has altered  the supervisory  process  without  \nadding  value  and has instead  created  higher  costs  of compliance.   \nAppraisal  requirements  have  been  cited  as an example  in this regard.  Over  the last two \ndecades,  the required  use of appraisals  has expanded  in response  to the 1990s  savings  and loans  \ncrisis  and the 2008  financial  crisis.  For real estate  in larger  metropo litan areas,  market  values  can \nbe readily  determined.  For real estate  in smaller  communities,  especially  rural  communities,  \nthere  may in fact be no “objective”  market  price.  Despite  this difference,  appraisal  regulation  is \nrigid  and restricts  the kind of judgment -based  lending  that facilitates  lending  to small  businesses  \nand individuals  in rural  and other  small  community  markets.  \nMy third  observation  is related  to the nature  of consumer  compliance  regulation,  and here \nI worry  the pendulum  has swung  too far.  To be sure,  regulation  has an important  role to play in \nconsumer  protection  and fair access  to credit.  Those  protections  should  not be diluted,  especially  \nfor banks  that rely on model -based  consumer  lending.  However,  for banks  that depend  on \nrelationship  lending  with customized  terms  and conditions,  the regulations  and the focus  on \nidentifying  specific  undesirable  products  seems  to run counter  to the requisite  subjectivity  that \nunderlies  the strengths  of community  bank  lending.  Mortgage  lending,  UDAAP  (Unfair, \nDeceptive,  or Abusive  Acts or Practices) , CRA  (Community  Reinvestment  Act) and fair lending  \nmust  not only protect  consumers  from  bad actors,  but allow  consumers  to be served  where  \nsubjectivity  is required.  Unfortunately,  I frequently  hear community  bankers  expressing  concern  \nthat compliance  reviews  have  taken  a more  prosecutorial  tone.  As one banker  noted,  these  \n\n9 \n reviews  have  forced  bank  customers  to prove  they aren’t  crooks  and bankers  to prove  to \nregulators  that they aren’t  deceptive  and unfair.     \n \nMoving  forward  \nIn making  these  observations,  I share  the desire  on the part of both bankers  and regulators  \nto find meaningful  solutions.  Community  banks  have  become  entangled  in a web of reforms  \nintended  to address  the risks  in the largest  banks.  These  reforms  respond  to a business  model  \nemployed  by a few large,  globally  active  banks,  but have  created  spillovers  for community  \nbanks.  Although  it is enticing  to contemplate  the construction  of separate  rules  and frameworks  \nthat reflect  these  different  business  models  and risks,  commercial  banks  of all sizes  remain  \nbeneficiaries  of a public  safety  net. For that reason,  I believe  community  banks  have  a vested  \ninterest  in seeing  that regulatory  reforms  move  ahead  to ensure  that the largest  banks  are well \ncapitaliz ed, well supervised,  well managed  and subject  to failure.  Achieving  that end will serve  \nthe public  well.  While  that work  is underway,  regulators  must  also allow  examiner  judgment  and \ncommon  sense  to play a greater  role in their supervisory  regimes  for comm unity  banks.  \nI’m often  told that the world  has become  more  complicated,  that we have  too many  banks  \nin the U.S. and that we cannot  go back  to less-complex  and more -straightforward  regulation  and \nrules  and greater  supervisory  judgment.   I’m not convinced.   One of the best responses  to that \nassertion  was from  Sir Mervyn  King,  the former  governor  of the Bank  of England.  Although  his \nreference  was made  in the context  of finding  a solution  to the issue  of too big to fail, the same  \nmight  be said for addressing  the regulatory  environment  more  generally.  He said, “There  are \nthose  who claim  that such proposals  are impractical.  It is hard to see why.  … What  does seem  \nimpractical,  however,  are the current  arrangements.”",
