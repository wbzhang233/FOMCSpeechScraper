George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 11, 2017  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do  not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Thank you . It’s a lways a  pleasure to join you at the  Central Exchange .  \nThe U.S. economy has now entered its ninth year of expansion, and labor mark ets have \nnormalized . Real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth has averaged 2. 1 percent over the last \nseven  years, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 200 9 to 4.2 percent today . \nOverall, the economy looks to be in good shape.  \nDespite this positive  news , there has been a great deal of attention focused on inflation . \nNot because the inflation rate is high like it was in the early 1980s, but rather because it is low . \nBased on the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation —the Personal Consumption \nExpenditure s (PCE) price index —the current inflation rate is running just under 1.5 percent . Of \ncourse, this is an aggregate measure of inflation . If a specific component of the  consumption \nbasket is taking a greater bite out of your paycheck,  such as the rental cost of housing, you might \nfeel inflation is plenty high . On the other hand, you mig ht find that the price of a big -screen \ntelevision  is more affordable . Taken together, this preferred measure of inflation includes a \ncollection of  hundreds of different individual prices, gets revised periodically, and doesn’t take \ninto account asset price inflation .  \nNow you may be asking yourself “what’s wrong with low inflation?”  It’s a fair question \nand one I plan to address  in my remarks today . I’ll talk ab out why I believe that, in the context of \na growing economy at full employment, low inflation is not a current worry . I’ll also review \nsome of the factors that are contributing to soft inflation readings and talk about the implications \nfor monetary  policy .  \nBefore continuing, I must tell you that any views I share are wholly my own.  \n \n \n\n2 \n Why the FOMC targets 2 percent inflation   \nAs background, let me explain why inflation plays a prominent role in the Fed’s policy \ndecisions . You may know  that Congress has given the Federal Reserve a mandate that is  spelled \nout in the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 , and it specif ies that the Federal Reserve \n“promote … maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates.”  Th is \nmandate is  often referred to as  a “dual mandate ” because moderate long -term interest rates are \nthe expected result of achieving the goals of maximum employment and stable prices .  \nHistorically , the price stability mandate was viewed largely in qualitative terms . For \nexample, for mer Fed Chairs Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan defined price stability as a state in \nwhich expectations of inflation  are not a pervasive influence on economic and financial behavior . \nOver time, however, as major central banks around the world —including, first, the Reserve Bank \nof New Zealand, then the Bank of Canada , the Bank of England , and the European Central Bank  \n—adopted inflation targets , the F ederal Reserve began considering a numerical inflation \nobjective for the United States . Seeing how  inflation targets in other countries were  viewed to \nhave helped successful ly bring inflation down from undesirably high levels and stabiliz e it near \ntarget , man y academics and policymakers advocated a numerical inflation ob jective for the \nFedera l Reserve. This was despite inflation having already stabiliz ed at moderate rates in the \nUnited States in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s  and early 2000s .  \nAfter several years of debating the merits of an explicit numerical inflation objective, the  \nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)  adopted a 2 percent inflation objective  in January \n2012 .1  In its  “Statement of Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy St rategy,”  the FOMC stated \n                                                 \n1 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC19960703meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20050202meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20070321meeting.pdf , \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20101015confcall.pdf , \n\n3 \n that “inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change  in the price index for \npersonal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal \nReserve’s statutory mandate.”2   \nThe Committee chose 2 percent as its objective based on a number of factors . One factor \nwas a consideration of the costs of inflation . When inflation is much above 2 percent, relative \nprice signals get distorted, uncertainty about the future price level increases, and income is \narbitrarily transferred from creditors and savers to borrowers . On the other hand, some argue that \ninflation much below 2 percent also could be  costly . For example, when inflation is low, nominal \ninterest rates tend to be low . As a result, there is less room to cut rates in an economic downturn \nand policymakers could be faced with resort ing to unconventional policy instruments when \ninterest rates are at zero , as occurred in 2008 .  \nAt the time the target was adopted  in 2012 , inflation in the United States appeared to be \nanchored near 2 percent , and m any other central banks had adopted 2 per cent as either the center \nof a target range for inflation or as a specific  target . In addition , monetary policy was highly \naccommodat ive in 2012 , with the policy interest rate near zero and t he Fed’s balance sheet large \nby historical standards , and growing . This highly accommodat ive stance of  policy caused some \nconcern that inflation expectations could  become unanchored  and move higher .  \nWhile I supported the 2012 decision to specify a 2 percent objective for inflation, in \nhindsight I think it has proven to  be far more challenging than expected both as a \ncommunications mechanism and a policy guide . Too much focus is placed on achieving this \nspecific  numerical target when, in fact, inflation is likely to fluctuate around that target with \n                                                                                                                                                             \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20110126meeting.pdf , and  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20111213meeting.pdf . \n \n2 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf . \n \n\n4 \n deviations that occas ionally might persist . In fact, the qualitative definition of price stability that \nguided Volcker and Greenspan  rings true today : An inflation rate that does not materially affect \nthe decisions of business or households is an inflation rate that is consistent with price stability . \nWhile I still see 2 percent as an appropriate long -run objective for policy, I think it makes sense \nto evaluate deviations from that objective in a broader context.  \n \nThe mandate  is not as simple as  a number  \nClearly, t he current inflation rate is running below 2 percent  and has been for several \nyears . But let’s put that in the context of the other leg of our dual mandate —maximum \nemployment . The unemployment rate is currently 4. 2 percent, b elow most estimates of the full -\nemplo yment unemployment rate , including that of the Congressional Budget Office (4.75  \npercent), the Survey of Professional Forecasters (4.5 percent), and the  FOMC  participant s’ \nmedian projection for the long er-run unemployment rate of 4.6 percent .  \nIn addition , FOMC participants project real GDP to grow faster over the next two years \nthan its longer -run growth rate of 1.8 percent, pushing the unemployment rate down further . \nThese projections suggest that the recent, and persistent, softness of inflation relative  to 2 percent \nhas not prevented the economy from achieving  and, arguably, overshooting maximum \nemployment . Indeed,  as recently as last year , the PCE inflation rate less food and energy prices \ncame in at 1.9 percent on a Q4 over Q4 basis. It ’s only been since February that we have seen a \nweakening in this measure of core inflation .  \nTaking the recent performance of the labor market and inflation together, I would argue \nthat the FOMC is, by historical standards, meeting the dual mandate . Yet our  policy interest rate \nremains below FOMC participants’ estimate of its longer -run level . Specifically, FOMC \n\n5 \n participants have lifted the federal funds rate —our target policy rate —four times beginning in \nDecember  2015, with the latest move in  June. With  these moves, the federal funds rate now \nstands at 1 to 1¼ percent compared to the FOMC’s median projection of the longer -run funds \nrate of 2.8 percent .  \n \nSoft inflation is not an indicator of cyclical weakness  \nSo what is driving this slowdown in inflati on? It does not appear that t he slowdown is \nassociated with a weake ning economy . As I mentioned earlier, the current unemployment rate is \nlower than many estimates of the full -employment rate , and the economy has been growing \nfaster than estimates of its l onger -run trend growth rate . These conditions might normally be \nassociated with rising inflation . That inflation has instead been falling does not , however , appear \nto reflect slack in labor markets.  \nReadings from the Kansas City Fed ’s Labor Market Conditio ns Indicators  (LMCI) \nsupport this view .3 The LMCI  looks at 24 different labor market variables and constructs two \nmeasures to describe labor market conditions : the level of activity and momentum. The level of \nactivity continues the improvement we’ve seen throughout this expansion and , except for May \nand July, it’s at its highest level since the end of the recession  and is about equal to its level at the \nend of the last expansion , suggesting tight labor market conditions. The other measure , focused \non th e momentum in the labor market , has remained at a high level , suggesting strength over the \nnear-term. Among the key variables driving improvement in the level of activity over the last six \nmonths were an increase in the quits rate and a decrease in the number  of people working part \ntime for economic reasons as a share of household employment . In other words, more people left \n                                                 \n3 See https://www.kansascityfed.org/~/media/files/publicat/research/indicatorsdata/lmci/2017/lmci_091317.pdf . \n \n\n6 \n their jobs for other employment and fewer people were working part -time because they couldn’t \nfind full -time jobs . These are favorable si gns, but history reminds us that they are unlikely to be \nsustainable in the longer -run. \nLabor markets also show limited slack based on behavior of the labor force participation \nrate. Demographic trends, particular ly the agi ng and retirement of the large ba by boom \ngeneration , have been exerting downward pressure on participation in the labor force  for some \ntime. However , over the last four years, the labor force participation rate has stabilized , after five \nyears of unprecedented  sharp declines that starte d in the last recession . The steady participation \nrate in recent years therefore signals that improving labor market conditions have drawn workers \nfrom the sidelines and more people are remaining in the workforce . Again, this is not a \ndevelopment  that can continue unabated . As the demographic trend reasserts itself, the labor \nforce participation rate will fall, tightening labor market conditions further .  \nAdditional evidence is based on research  by economists at the San Francisco Fed  who \nlooked at unemployment over the past 100 years.4  They estimate a hypothetical unemployment \nrate that is consistent with stable inflation and aggregate production being at its long -run level, \nbased on the relationship between inflation and labor market slack. Go ing back to 1890, they \nfind that this stable -inflation unemployment rate fluctuates in a relative ly narrow range of 4½ to \n5½ percent . With today’s unemployment rate of 4. 2 percent, we are below the low end of this \nrange.  \nIf weakness in the economy is not a  cause of soft inflation, then what is?  My best guess \nis that it is a combination of idiosyncratic shocks combined with a number of longer -run changes \nthat are holding down inflation . Examples of idiosyncratic shocks are large declines in the prices \n                                                 \n4 Regis Barnichon and Ch ristian Matthes, “The Natural Rate of Unemployment over the Past 100 Years,” Federal \nReserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter , August 14, 2017.  \n\n7 \n of telecommunications services associated with the introduction of unlimited data plans and one -\ntime downward movements in pharmaceutical prices as various drugs come off patent . Among \nthe longer -run forces holding inflation down are the lingering effects of th e appreciation of the \ndollar and decline in oil prices from 2014 . While these forces should now be abating, several  \nstructural factors —such as global competition, an agi ng population, technological change  and \ndisruptive forces in the retail sector —may persist . For example, Amazon’s purchase of Whole \nFoods and the expansion of Aldi and Lidl in the U.S. market are disrupting the grocery business \nand increas ing competitive pressure.  \nThese developments, along with the persistence of inflation below target , may also have \ncontributed to inflation expectations settling at a level somewhat less than 2 percent. If so, \nmonetary policy may be confronted with a difficult dilemma . Should policy normalization \nproceed on a gradual path to avoid overheating the economy? Or would it be more prudent to \nwait until inflation reaches 2 percent before taking further steps to tighten policy?  \n \nPatience is not always a virtue  \nRecent experience suggests inflation has not been very responsive to labor market slack . \nEven in the aftermath of the Great Recession, when unemployment reached 10 percent, the \ninflation rate excluding food and energy  prices  has fluctuated in a relatively n arrow range \n(roughly 1  percent  to 2 percent) . In my view, because of the weakness of th e relationship  \nbetween inflation and slack , it would take a considerable overheating of the economy to move \ninflation more quickly up to 2 percent . Such overheating would, in th e meantime, foster  a \nmisallocation of resources and risk financial instability as asset prices continue to climb . In \naddition, there is  a meaningful risk that if the unemployment rate fell significantly further, \n\n8 \n inflation might move considerably above 2 pe rcent, causing policymakers to tighten policy  \nabruptly . Monetary policy affects the economy with considerable lags s uch that, by the time we \nsee inflation actually moving up to 2 percent, it may be too late to prevent an undesirable \novershooting. This go -stop approach to monetary policy serves to foster uncertainty and too \noften ends in recession.  \nI also recall another time when concern about low inflation led to a delay in interest rate \nnormalization . From 2002 to 2006 as the economy recovered only gradual ly from the 2001 \neconomic recession, the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to 1 percent and held it there for a year . \nIn doing so , the FOMC was responding in part to a concern that inflation was falling below \ndesired levels , with an outside risk of actual de flation . During this period , the real time data on \nthe core PCE price index fell below 1 percent . And i n May 2003, the FOMC pointed explicitly to \nthe risk of an “unwelcome substantial fall in inflation.”5  \nIn retrospect, the inflation data was subsequently revised up, and by 2005 inflation had \nrisen above 2 percent . Arguably, and although not the root cause,  the low level of interest rates in \nthis period fostered the financing of asset purchases with short -term borrowing, feeding a \nbuildup of financial imbalances and a bubble in the housing market . These excesses ended with a \nsevere financial crisis and the Great Recession .  \nTo be sure, our understanding of inflation dynamics is imperfect. It is prudent for t he \nFOMC to move cautiously and continue to monitor inflation developments to better understand \nthe causes and consequences of low inflation . In saying this, I recognize the various tradeoffs \nbetween maximum employment and price stability and their implicat ions for financial stability \n                                                 \n5 See https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20030506meeting.pdf . \n \n\n9 \n and sustainable economic growth . On balance, therefore, my judg ment is that we should continue \nto make gradual adjustments to normalize policy rates.  \nWaiting for solid evidence that inflation will reach 2 percent before taking  further steps to \nremove accommodation carries risks of overheating the economy, fostering financial instability, \nand perhaps putting in motion an undesirable increase in inflation . Delaying monetary policy \nadjustments c ould further tighten labor markets a nd stretch the economy’s productive capacity . \nThe resulting inflationary pressures may build slowly, though  they may be difficult to contain \nonce released .  \n \nConclusion  \nLow inflation, in itself, is not a problem in an economy that is growing and operating at \nfull employment . In such an environment, it is desirable to sustain  the economic expansion by \navoiding overheating and financial market instability. The best way to do that is to gradua lly \nadjust policy rates to more -normal settings . With  this approach,  it seems reasonable to expect \nthat inflation will gradually rise as labor markets tighten further and the effects of past oil price \ndeclines, dollar appreciation, and idiosyncratic price movements fade ."

        "content": "Labor Market Trends and Monetary Policy  \n \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 5, 2017  \nInvesting in America’s Workforce Conference  \nAustin, Texas  \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal \nReserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n\n 1 I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak here in Austin . Understanding the \ndynamics of the nation’s l abor market  plays an essential role in the work of the Federal Reserve \nand for me a s a regional Federal Reserve Bank president .  \nIn my role, I meet with business, labor  and community leaders  throughout the Federal \nReserve’s Tenth  District , which encompasses Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, \nWyoming, and portions of Missouri and New Mexico . I regularly  hear about  the importance of a \nstrong alignment between employer s’ needs and the skills available in the local labor force . The \nchallenge  is to find the best opportunities and partnerships across a wide range of organizations.  \nIn my remarks today, I’ll discuss the progress that has been made in the current economic \nexpansion toward full employment . I’ll then turn to longer -term shifts in th e types of jobs that \nare offered by employers, and how these shi fts in demand for skills have affected  workers . \nFinally, I’ll conclude my remarks with some comments on the  current stance of monetary policy \nas the Federal Reserve seeks to promote long -run s ustainable growth by foster ing maximum \nemployment and price stability.  \n \nLabor Market  Dynamics in the Current Economic Expansion  \n This is the 100th consecutive month of the ongoing economic expansion . In historical \nterms, it is the third -longest U.S. expansion on record going back to 1850 . Total employment has \nincreased on net by 17 million workers  since 2009 , which is double the number of jobs lost in the \nmost recent  recession. As employment has steadily increased, the unemp loyment rate has fallen \nfrom 10 percent in 2009 to its current level of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below \nnearly all estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that \nis estimated to prevail in the longer  run in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.  \n\n 2  While the headline variables  indicate that much of the labor market has returned to pre -\nrecession levels, other indicators reveal broader  shifts taking place . For example, the percentage \nof people participati ng in the labor force has decline d notably since the recession and has not \nmade much of a recovery . In 2007, 66 percent of the U.S . adult population (ages 16 and over) \neither had a job or were actively looking for employment . By 2015, the labor force parti cipation  \nrate had declin ed to 62 percent —this represent s a shift of 10 million people out of the labor force  \nbased on our current population . A large portion of this decline wa s due to the aging of the \npopulation , with many baby boomers reaching retirement age . However, some of the decline was \ndue to workers being discouraged about their job prospects  and no longer seeking employment . \n Over the past two years, we have seen a modest pickup in the labor force partici pation \nrate, which is  a sign of improving  labor market conditions . Research by my staff has investigated \nthis improvement to better assess  its underlying dynamics.1 While an increase in the participation \nrate may seem to suggest a surge of new workers ente ring the labor force, entries actually slowed  \nin 2016 . The increase in the participation rate was instead a result of a decline in the number of \npeople exiting the labor force . This decline, in c ombination with steady increases  in employment, \nsuggests workers are now more attached to the labor force tha n in earlier years during  the \nrecovery . As workers are matched to better  and more stable jobs , the rotating  of workers in and \nout of employment and in and out of the labor force s lows . An additional contributing factor was \nthat the group experiencing the largest slowing  in labor force exits was the population aged 55 \nand older . This suggests that for older workers, the reduction in exits may indicate that some \nworkers were delaying  retirement decisions.  \n                                                        \n1 Tüzemen, Didem and Jonathan Willis. 2016. “ What is Behind the Recent Increase in Labor \nForce Participation ?” The Macro Bulletin , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, November.   \n \n\n 3  \nJob Polarization  \n Despite  overall improvements in employment and the participation rate, we know there \nare still segments of the working -age population that have not experienced as much of a recovery  \nas we would like . This group has  been impacted by  longer -term trend s. In particular, workers in \nmiddle -skill jobs have seen the demand for their skills steadily decline . For decades, these jobs \nwere the gateway to the middle class.  \nThe decline in middle -skill jobs is the result of a number of sweeping changes affecting \nthe economy . If we look back to the 1980s, examples of middle -skill jobs that were much more \nprevalent than we see today include as sembly -line manufacturing jobs and clerical and \nadministrative positions. In 1983, nearl y 60 percent of all jobs were in middle -skill occupations.2  \nToday, that employment share has declined to 4 3 percent . Based on current employment levels, \nthis shift would be equivalent to moving 22 million jobs away from middle -skill occupations .  \nMany  of the employment opportunities in our economy have shifted toward high -skill \njobs, which are jobs that typically require a college education . Since 1983, the share of high -skill \njobs has increased from 26 percent to 39 percent .  \nWhat is perhaps more surp rising is what we have seen at the other end of the spectrum . \nThe share of employment for low -skill jobs has also increased, from 15 percent to 18 percent . \nWorkers in these jobs typically have little formal education beyond high school, and they work \nin oc cupations that are service -oriented and cannot be easily automated, such as food \npreparation, cleaning and  security services .  \n                                                        \n2 Tüzemen, Di dem and Jonathan Willis. 2013. “ The Vanishing Middle: Job Polarization and \nWorkers’ Response to the Decline in Middle -Skill Job s.” Economic Review , Federal Reserve \nBank of Kansas City , first quarter , pp. 5 -32.  \n \n\n 4 This shift of employment toward both high - and low -skill jobs and away from middle -\nskill positions  has been labeled “job polariz ation.”   \n \nJob Polarization: Gender and Race  \n As a result of this development , the current generation entering the workforce finds a \nvery different landscape than the  labor market of  the 1980s . How have new entrants to the labor \nforce adapted over time to be better prepared for the current labor market?   Understanding these \ntrends is particularly relevant to those of you  focused on developing today’s workforce .  \nI’d like to use two demographic lenses  to illustrate  how the population is adapting to job \npolar ization —looking first at shifts by gender and second at shifts by race.  \nOver  the past three decades, both men and women experienced declines  in the shares of  \nemployment in middle -skill jobs, but for different reasons. For women, t he main losses in the \nshare of middle -skill employment were in  office and administrative occupations, likely related to \nthe replacement of many secretarial and clerical jobs with desktop computing. For men, m ajor \nlosses were  in production occupations, likely related to the decline in employment in the \nmanufacturing industry.  \nWomen and men  responded very differently to these developments .  \nFor women, the decline was accompanied by an almost equally large increase in  the share \nof high-skill job s, particularly in  managerial, professional and technical occupations, such as \nengineering, finance, management  and medicine. Based on the shift, women today occupy a \nlarger portion of high -skill jobs compared to the 1980s.  \nFor men, the shift away from middle -skill occupati ons led to almost equal increases in \nthe shares of employment in both low- and high -skill occupations. Accordingly , a larger portion \n\n 5 of low-skill occupations , which are primarily service jobs, are held by men today as compared to \nthe 1980s.   \nGender differe nces in job shifts line up closely with gender differences in educational \nattainment. While levels of attainment increased for both male and female workers  over the past \nthree decades , the change was more pronounced for women. The strong shift toward high -skill \njobs for women  was associated with  a large increase in the share of women with a bachelor’s \ndegree or higher. Educational attainment of men has risen more modestly, in line with the \nsmaller shift of male employment toward high -skill jobs.   \n  While we see very different response s to job polarization between  men and women, the \nresponse s across racial groups are more similar, with difference s predominately reflecting \nhistorical  disparities in levels of educational attainment .  \nTo illustrate the response s to job polarization by race , I will fo cus on two groups, African \nAmerican and Caucasian workers , who together account for 9 0 percent of employment in the \nUnited States.  First, however, let me describe the terms and information I’ m using . The statistics \ncome from the Current Population Survey  (CPS) , which is the survey used to construct the \nunemployment rate . The terms I’ll use for race also require clarification . The term s African \nAmerican and black are used synonymously in  the official data collection and so I will use the \nterm black to mean African American and white to mean Caucasian . Finally, I’d like to note that \nin this survey, Hispanic workers account for 16 percent of total employment, and many  likely \nself-identify a s white when identifying  their race  in the survey . They have the option of \nidentifying as Hispanic in a separate question on ethnicity.  \n Over the past two decades, both white and black workers have experienced similar shifts \nin job opportunities consisten t with job polarization . Both groups experienced a significant \n\n 6 decline in the employment  share of middle skill jobs .3 And e mployment for both populations \nshifted toward high - and low -skill jobs, with a stronger shift toward high -skill jobs.  \n While employme nt shifts were similar, white workers have had a consistently larger \nshare of employment in high -skill occupations . In 201 7, 40 percent of white workers were \nemploy ed in high -skill jobs, relative to 30 percent of black workers . Both populations have a \nsimilar share of workers in middle -skill jobs —approximately 45 percent . This implies that there \nis a larger share of black workers in low -skill jobs than white workers:  24 percent of black \nworkers and 17 percent of white workers.  \n As employers have increas ed the share of high -skill jobs, workers have responded by \nobtaining higher levels of education than previous generations . The share of workers with a \nbachelor’s degree ha s increased by approximately  10 percentage points over the past two \ndecades for both black and white workers . But underlying this shift in educational attainment, a \npersistent education gap exists between black and white populations . In 201 7, 36 percent of \nwhite workers had a bachelor’s degree, relative to 2 8 percent of black workers.  \n The difference in  education al attainment  is very important . It is increasingly challenging \nfor a worker to obtain a high -skill job without having a bachelor’s degree . During the past 20 \nyears, workers with a high school diploma or some college education have experienced a \ndecrease in the likelihood of obtaining one of these jobs .  \nOf particular concern is the divergence in opportunities between those with a bachelor’s \ndegree and those with some college  education . For those with a college degree, the opportunit ies \nare clear: high -skill jobs . However, individuals with some college education  or an a ssociate ’s \n                                                        \n3Kansas City Fed  Economic Research Department. 2017 . “Assessing Differences in Labor \nMarket Outcomes Across Race, Age, and Educational Attainment .” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, Research Working Paper no. 17 -03, April.  \n\n 7 degree  are struggling to find good employment opportunities . Especially in the case of  black \nworkers, individuals with some college education are increasingly ending up in low -skill jobs.  \n The workforce development challenge  is steadily  shifting to how to best equip workers \nwith the skills in demand by employers . More than 60 percent of wor kers do not have a college \ndegree, and are thus most likely competing for middle -skill jobs . Employers will no longer \nsimply welcome a young worker with a high school diploma and say, “I’ll train you ,” but are  \nmore likely to ask, “What skills do you alread y have?” Young people  today who do not see \ncollege as their best path forward need to have better awareness and opportunities for vocational \ntraining  and post -high-school certification and training programs in areas such as skilled trades, \nhealthcare, and coding . With improved training, they will be better equipped for today’s middle -\nskill jobs, which despite declines,  still account for 4 3 percent of all jobs.  \n The Federal Reserve System is actively involved in a range of activities t o promote  better \noutcomes for workers . We are engaged in research, roundtable conversations with industry and \nlabor leaders, conferences like this one, and publications, such as our recent publication \nexploring workforce development policies for the 21st century.  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy  \n As the Federal Reserve determine s the appropriate settings for the nation’s monetary \npolicy, it must weigh a variety of economic factors, including the labor market trends that I have \ndescribed today . In the short run, I look a cross a wide range of business sectors and assess their \nperformance , monitoring their demand for workers in a tightening labor market and their capital \ninvestment plans . In the longer run, I evaluate trends such as job polarization and an aging \nworkforce , and consider what those structural forces imply for the Federal Reserve’s goals of \n\n 8 maximum employment and price stability . These are challenging economic factors  to evaluate, \nwith different  forces typically pushing the economy in different directions at the same time . \nMonetary  policy is a blunt tool with limited ability to influence any specific  segment of the \neconomy . It is most adept at addressing factors related to the business cycle and least adept at \naddressing  the longer -run trends such as  job polarization and an aging workforce.  \n For monetary policy makers, the key question centers on the appropriate level of \naccommodation , at this stage of the economic expansion , to best foster long -run sustainable \ngrowth . At the most recent  Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC ) meeting, the Committee \nannounced plans to initiate its balance sheet normalization program in October . Large -scale asset \npurchases (LSAPs), better known as quantitative easing, or QE, transformed the size and \ncomposition of the Fed’s balance sheet from less than $1 trillion in mid -2008  to approximately \n$4.5 trillion today . This unconventional policy was implemented because the Federal Reserve’s \nconventional policy tool, the feder al funds target rate , had been lowered to zero in December \n2008 , and the Federal Reserve determined that additional measures were warranted . Beginning \nthis month, the FOMC plans to gradually reduce its securities holdings by decreasing \nreinvestment of the principal payments received from maturing securities . This gradual reduction \nin securities holdings will continue “until the FOMC judges that the Federal Reserve is holding \nno more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effe ctively.”  \nIn regard to interest rates, the FOMC has maintained a very accommodative stance of \npolicy up to this point . The target range for the federal funds rate was set at the zero lower bound \nfrom 2008 until the end of 2015 . Starting in December 2015, t he federal funds rate has been \nraised a total of four times to its  current target range of 1 to 1 ¼ percent . During this first phase of \n\n 9 monetary policy normalization, economic growth has remained above trend and the \nunemployment rate has declined from 5.0 p ercent to 4.4 percent.   \nLooking forward, policymakers face the challenge of setting the appropriate path of \ninterest rates to promote the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability .  \nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate a djustments will be needed to \nmove the federal fund s rate toward its longer -run level . With an economy growing at an above -\ntrend rate and unemployment at a low level , postponing the removal of accommodation poses \nrisks to sustainable growth and financial st ability . At this stage of the expansion, it is appropriate \nto move cautiously . But waiting too long  risks more aggressive moves , which , history shows can \ninvite  prospects of recession . And a continuation of current levels of accommodation risks \nsimilar distortions in capital allocation toward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, \nendeavors that could result in financial imbalances.  \nMoving inte rest rates at a gradual pace toward a level consistent with longer -run growth \nis the best step to help pro mote a continuation of the economic expansion . For the Federal \nReserve, such efforts are the most likely course, in my view, to meet our long -run goals of \nmaximum employment and price stability . And by doing so, we can best foster conditions to \nsupport wor kforce development efforts to invest in workers and build a stronger econom y."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSeptember 27, 2017  \nBanking and the Economy: A Forum for Minority Bankers  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \nKansas City, Mo.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representative s. \n \n\n1 \n  \nThank you for the opportunity to join you  today . I am pleased to host  this important event \nat the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.    \nThe Kansas City Fed is one of 12 regional Reserve Banks  that, along with the \ngovernment agency called the Federal Rese rve Board in Washington, D.C., comp rise the Federal \nReserve System, our nation’s central bank.  The work of t he Federal Reserve can be summarized \nin three primary mission areas : monetary policy , financial institu tion supervision and regulation, \nand payment services. And taken together, these activities are intended to maintain economic and \nfinancial stability as important conditions for the health of the U.S. economy and the prosperity \nof the Am erican public . As a regional Federal Reserve president, I oversee the Kansas City Fed’s \nwork in these areas across a seven -state region with branch offices in Oma ha, Denver  and \nOklahoma City.  \nIn my remarks today , I will offer a brief perspective on the pe rformance of the nation’s \neconomy  and the current stance of the Fede ral Reserve’s monetary policy. I’ll also discuss  the \nimportance of acces s to credit in creating broadly shared economic growth , concluding with \nhighlights of how these issues affect communities, including minority communities . Before \ncontinuing, I must tell you that the views I share are wholly my own.  \n \nThe U.S. e conomy  \nThe U.S. economy  is in reasonably good sha pe, with growth reported to have increased \n3.0 percent in the second quart er of 2017, a rebound from its weak first quarter pace. Consumers \ncontinue to be the main force behind this expansion , with consumption accou nting for more than \ntwo-thirds  of the nation’s  gross domestic product  (GDP ). We also  have  recently seen business \n\n2 \n investment pick up, experiencing the strongest growth rate since mid -2014. Looking forward, \nwith accommodative financial conditions, elevated levels of consumer and business confidence, \nand a brighter global growth outlook, I  expect the economy will continue  to grow over the next \nfew years with low unemployment a nd low inflation.  \nLabor market s have continued to strengthen with  total employment increas ing on net by \n17 million workers, which is double the number of jo bs lost in the last recession. As employment  \nhas steadily increased, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to its  current \nlevel of 4.4 percent. This level of unemployment is below nearly all estimates of the natural rate \nof unemployment, which is the level of unemployment that is estimated to prevail in the longer \nrun in the absence of cyclical fluctuations.  \nAt last week’s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) meeting, the committee decided \nto maintain the current level of short -term interest rates , continui ng an accommodative polic y \nstance.  Another important action was taken , however. The c ommittee announced it would initiate \nthe process of normalizing its balance sheet.   \nBased on my own economic outlook, further gradual rate adjustments will be needed to \nmove the federal fund s rate toward its longer -run level. With an economy growing at an above -\ntrend rate and unemployment below most estimates of its long -run level, continuing to remove  \naccommodation will be important for long-run sustainable growth and financial stability.   \n \nAccess to credit  \nAppropriate monetary policy settings serve an important role in sust aining growth in the \nlong run. But there are many other important factors that determine the nation’s economic \ngrowth , including  a healthy and prod uctive labor market, inn ovation  and access to capital . I \n\n3 \n would like to turn to the issue of the availability of credit  and its implications for the economic \nprospects  of households and businesses .  \nThe banking system in the United States has long been an essential source of cap ital for \nthe nation’s economy. Here i n the Tenth Federal Reserve District , we have a large number of \ncommunity banks.  \nHaving adapted over the years to significant economic and regulatory changes, as well as \ntechnology disruption, the community bank busine ss model has retained its unique focus on \nrelationship banking. These banks, their owners and the people who work for them are generally \nmembers of the communities they serve . The relationships are long -term and the incentives of \nthe bank and the borrower are well aligned . \nWhether the community is a  small rural town or an urban neighborhood —this business \nmodel features local bankers who are immersed in their communities, understand the  economic \ndrivers of the ir communities and often serve as leaders in their communities. Those of you who \nare bankers here today recognize t his critically important role , and your financial institutions  \nhave  recognize d that this requires diverse staff reflecting the communities they serve .    \nHowever, diverse tale nt in banks is just one aspect of serving a community from a base of \nundersta nding and personal engagement. Diverse ownership of banks is also important . Yet, \nthere are very few minority -owned banks in the United States  today and their numbers are \ndeclining . Over the 10 -year span since 2006 to the end of 2016, the total number of FDIC -\ninsured minority depository institutions has declined from 194 to 157.1 Within this category, the \nnumber of institutions classified as Native American or Alaskan Nativ e American has held \n                                                           \n1 Data Source: FDIC -Insured Minority Depository Institutions data, year -end totals.  Accessible via: \nhttps://www.fdic.gov/regulations/resources/minority/mdi.html . Minority status is defined either by the \nconcentration of ownership status among a certain minority group or the concentration of board membership by a \nminority group of an institution that serves primarily that minority group.  \n\n4 \n relatively steady , falling from 20 to 18 , while the number of Hispanic American banks has \ndropped from 48 to 39. The sharpest decline has been in  the number of African A merican banks , \nwhich  has fallen  by almost half to 24 institutions, according to FDIC data.  \n \nCommunity ban k trends  \nThese trends are not limited to minority banks , however. The number of banks in the \nUnited States has dropped considerably from a little more than14,000 in 1982 , according to \nFDIC data,  to around 5,000 today , and much of this decline has been in banks with less than \n$100 million in assets.  How these consolidation trends affect access to credit is important to \nunderstand.  \nYou have only to read today’s news to recognize the  value of a local bank . It was recently  \nreported  that Bank of America, the second largest lender in the United States, has closed nearly \n1,600 branches since the financial crisis . These closures p rimarily impact  rural areas . While \nsome branches were sold to smaller lenders, others were simply closed with customers directed \nto offices dozens of miles away.2 On the other hand , at about the same time this story was \nmaking headlines, another article highlighted efforts to save a communit y hospital in the \nMissouri boot heel region and the involvemen t of a community bank in providing its financing .  \nAs the banker explained: “We knew what would happen to this community if that hospital \nclosed.”3  \n                                                           \n2 https://www.wsj.com/articles/how -bank -of-america -ditched -1-597-branches -across -the-u-s-1505646000    \n3 http://kcur.org/post/how -one-missouri -town -saved -its-hospital -financial -collapse#stream/0  \n\n5 \n  \nThe h istoric role of minority -owned b anks  \nThroughout the history of our financial system, the inability to access credit often spurred \nthe establishment of a local bank. These banks often proved to be innovative lenders that \nconsidered the unique characteristics of local communities . \nMinority -owned banks emerged for the same fundamental reason , and their history tells \nan important story  about access to the financial system , and understanding history is so important \nto understanding how to solve the challenges we face today.  \nIn the Tenth Federal Reserve District, Centinel Bank of Taos, N.M. , is a great example.  \nCentinel is generally bel ieved to be the first mainland U.S.-based Hispanic bank. If you were \nhere last year, you remember one of our speakers was Centinel’s chair and CEO, Rebeca Romero \nRainey. In 1959, Rebeca’s grandfather, who had serve d in the military and then earned a law \ndegree, was denied a $50 loan  to purchase office furniture. At that point , he vowed to create a \nbank that would provide equal access to  credit for  everyone . After gathering support from about \n300 investors, the bank opened for business  in 1969 .  \nMore recently, the first bank owned or controlled by a Native American tribe was created \nin 1987 when the Blackfeet Tribe of northwestern Montana took over a failed bank in the city of \nBrowning, Mont. Blackfeet National Bank l ater became Native America Bank, NA .  \nWith some of the earliest African American banks , loans were primarily to mutual aid \nsocieties and entrepreneurs.4 The number of African American -owned banks increased \nsubstantially after 1900 and, between 1900 and 1914, the number of African American business \nenterprises doubled, with more substantial increases in some business segments, particularly \n                                                           \n4 Ammons, Lia. “The Evolution of Black -Owned Banks in the United States Between the 1880s and the 1990s.” \nJournal of Bla ck Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Mar. 1996).  \n\n6 \n retail merchants .5 This was a notable expansion of opportunity compared to the late 1800s when \nthe primary occupations held by African Americans were blacksmith, tailor, barber and similar \njobs.6 \nThe first banks with African American ownership opened during the Reconstruc tion \nperiod in our country . The first to receive a charter was The Savings Bank of the Grand Fountain \nof the United Order of True Reformers.  In 1890, the b ank’s founder , William Washington \nBrowne , explained his goal: “The True Reformers sounds like reforme rs of character, but we are \nhunting for people who are already reformed. The church …has the other kind of reformation in \nhand; mine is financial reform. I want to go forward reforming our people financially. We are \nthrowing away money enough to buy this c ountry.”   \nBrowne’s bank, and the others that  soon followed his model, sought to provide services \nto customers who  had suffered in many ways , including being exploited financially. Prior to that \nbank’s creation, the government had established the Freedman’ s Bank in 1865 specifically to \nserve the nation’s African American population. Although the intentions were honorable and \nbranches were opened in several states in an attempt to con nect to local populations, the b ank’s \nleadership was not aligned with the n eeds of its communities. Instead, corruption and high -risk \ninvestments made with bank deposits resulted in its failure (despite the best efforts of Frederick \nDouglass , who had fought to save the institution after the damage had been done). In this era \nbefore deposit insurance, the collapse took with it the life savings of 61,000 savers who were \nstruggling to become established in the United States.  \nBrowne’s life story is itself very much about the ability to overcome challenges and is as \ninspirational as a ny in American history. At age of 13, he escape d slavery and  eventually joined \n                                                           \n5 Meier, August. “Negro Class Structure and Ideology in the Age of Booker T. Washington.” Phylon. Clark Atlanta \nUniversity. Vol. 23, No. 3. (Q3, 1962).  \n6 Ibid.  \n\n7 \n the Union Army. After gaining an education in Wisconsin, he returned to the south as a teacher \nand served as a minister. Influenced by his experiences, Browne established the Gr and Fountain \nof the United Order of True Reformers, a fraternal organization with the stated goals of taking \ncare of the sick, burying the dead and providing other assist ance.   \nBrowne had not necessarily sought to establish a bank to achieve personal goals. Instead \nthe bank was created in response to the needs of his organization, which reflected the needs of \nthe community. A Virginia chapter had been unable to organize because of difficulties safely \nstoring its treasury of about $100. Denied access to a t raditional banking institution, the group \nhad to instead rely on the safe of a local storekeeper, which had proven problematic. The chapter \nwas ready to give up, but Browne encouraged them forward. Creating a bank provided a degree \nof security for the orga nization by meeting a very fundamental financial services need —in this \ncase, the bank was literally a  response to the need for a safe place to store funds —but Browne \nknew, as we know today, that banks also foster opportunities. It was  to be an economic win/win \n—a place to pool the resources of savers to meet the needs of borrowers.  \nIn the words of one of Browne’s associates: “We mean to encourage … people to get \nhomes and means upon which they may independently subsist.”   \nBrowne kept his word. Throughout the panic of 1893 , which saw nearly 600 banks \nnationwide either fail or suspend operations, it is recorded that Browne’s bank was the only bank \nin the entire state of Virginia that co ntinued paying out all checks. During the crisis, at  least one \nlocal public school was able to obtain the funds necessary for paying salaries from Browne’s \nbank after being denied by  other financial institutions. Similarly, the bank loaned money to the \nCity of Richmond in the early 1900s when the city was a lso unable to obtain funds from other \nsources. This is the story of community banks —saving the local hospital in Missouri today, \n\n8 \n fundin g Hispanic customers in 1969, and  saving the city o f Richmond in the early 1900s. An \ninstitution that is local enough to understand and meet the credit needs of a community \ndetermines whether that community thrives or withers.  \n \nConclusion  \nThis history is a reminder of the importance of access to credit and the role it plays in the \nprosperity of households a nd the vitality o f businesses. In the words of one of Browne’ s \ncontemporaries , “Banks are the life blood of trade and progress, whenever they may be \nestablished.”7 It is as  true today as it was in 1890. And the health and diversity of our banking \nsystem remains key  to the promise of delivering broad -based economic gains for thousands of \ncommunities  and for the millions of households and businesses that they serve . \n                                                           \n7 Burrell, William Patrick and Johnson, D.E.

Lee Smith and Timothy Todd assisted in preparing these remarks.  \n\n1 \n I want to thank you for the opportunity to join you today. The Denver Branch of the \nFederal Reserve Bank of  Kansas City was created to serve as the central bank’s connection to \nportions of the Mountain West that are within the Tenth Federal Reserve Distric t – Colorado, \nWyoming and n orthern New Mexico. To help us fulfill that responsibility, we rely heavily on o ur \ncontacts from within this community, including many joining us here  today , as well as others \nacross  the region to provide us with insight on emerging financial and economic conditions. The \ncontributions by these individuals are extremely important to me  in my responsibilities \nrepresenting this  region in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberations , and I want to \nexpress my thanks to those who provide this valuable input . \nToday, I would like to talk  about a topic that has been receiving much attenti on — the \nFederal Reserve’s balance sheet  – and what it means when policymakers talk about its \nnormalization  and ceasing reinvestments . Large scale asset purchases  (LSAPs) , better known as \nquantitative easing , or QE, have transformed the Fed’s balance sheet  and sparked active debate, \nboth within and outside the FOMC, about the costs and benefits of this unconventional monetary \npolicy  that was deployed during and after the financial crisis . Given the juncture we are at in the \nprocess of normali zing monetary policy , now is a useful time to revisit these issues  based on \nwhat we know — and what we have yet to learn — about using the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet in this way . \nBecause the majority of my regional contacts are neither central bankers nor economists, \nI have focused my remarks today on providing a basic foundation for understanding this headline \nissue . I’ll begin my comments with a primer on the nature of the Federal Reserve’s assets and \nliabilities . Then, I will describe how the Fed’s balan ce sheet changed starting in 2008 based on \nFOMC decisions to make credit easier and provide more accommodation to the economy . \n\n2 \n Finally, I’ll discuss some of the  key issues policymakers are considering today and what I see as \npossible implications.  \n \nInside the N umbers  \nUnderstanding the Fed’s balance sheet requires some understanding of t he Federal \nReserve System structure designed by Congress in 1913 . The Fed  consists of a government \nagency in Washington, D.C.  known as The Federal Reserve Board o f Governors,  and 12 \nseparately -incorporated, nationally -chartered Reserve Banks. When we talk about the Federal \nReserve’s balance sheet today , we are actually referring to the combined  balance sheets of the 12 \nindividual regional Federal Reserve Banks .  \nThis combined  balance sheet is audited annually by an independent  audit firm, currently \nKPMG , and is made available to the public on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem’s website: www.federalreserve.gov . Also  on this website are unaudited quarterly \nfinancial report s that include the combined  balance sheet. And each week, generally late on \nThursday afternoon, changes to the Fed’s balance sheet are published on the website in the H.4.1 \nstatistical release,  known as “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances .”  \nThe current  $4.5 trillion balance sheet  certainly stands out . The Fed’s assets primarily \ninclude a securities portfolio  of System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings . The Fed’s \nliabilities primarily consist of Federal Reserve notes in circulation and depository institution \ndeposits.2 \n                                                           \n2 Additional details on the composition of assets and liabilities in the Fed’s combined balance sheet at March 31, \n2017 can be found in the unaudited quarterly financial report, which is available online at: \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/quarterly -report -20170331.pdf  \n \n\n3 \n What is unique about the Fed’s  balance sheet is its ability to  expand  and shrink as needed \nto facilitate the conduct of  monetary policy  in response to economic conditions . Conventional \nmonetary policy involves the buying and selling of securities. At the conclusion of each FOMC \npolicy meeting, a directive is communicated to the Federal Reserve’s open market desk, which is \nbased at the New  York Fed. This directive also is communicated publicly in the FOMC’s post \nmeeting statement, which is heavily covered by the financial press.  \nIn the case of a conventional policy tightening, the Fed’s open market desk will sell \nsecurities . The funds recei ved from those sales will then be removed from circulation, reducing \nthe overall amount of available reserves  in the banking system . The resulting smaller pool of \nreserves from which to lend  increa ses the cost of borrowing – or to put it more clearly,  interest \nrates move higher . If the FOMC decides to ease monetary policy, this process would work in \nreverse, with the Fed buying securities.  \nThe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has grown considerably over the past decade. At \nnearly  $4.5 trillion, it represents almost 25 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP)  compared to  just 6 percent of GDP in 2007 . Liabilities of the Fed at that time were \ncomprised almost entirely of currency in circulation with reserves averaging about  $10 billion.  \nToday , reserves total more than $2 trillion. These reserves were created  by the Fed  to finance the \npurchase  of long -term Treasury and agency debt during multiple rounds of  large scale asset \npurchases , also known as  LSAPs . Although  the Fed stopped its program of expansionary bond \npurchases in October 2014, it has continued to reinvest the returns it receives from the maturing \nsecurities. As  a result, the current size and composition of the balance sheet has remained \nunchanged for mo re than 2 ½ years.  \n \n\n4 \n The Shift to Unconventional P olicy  \nIn the pre -crisis monetary policy framework, the Fed adjusted its holdings of Treasury \nsecurities t o affect the amount of reserves in the banking system  through the process I explained \nearlier . Due to the low level of  excess  reserves banks held  at that time , modest adjustments in the \nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet influenced the federal funds rate , which is the rate that banks lend \ntheir reserves to each other overnight . When t his was the key mechanism  to influence monetary \npolicy , open market operations required a relatively small balance sheet  with assets  comprised \nprimarily of short -term Treasuries. However, this pre -crisis framework was challenged during \nthe global  financial crisis.  \nIn December 2008 , the economic outlook deteriorated to the point that the FOMC voted \nto target a federal funds rate of zero to 25 basis points. Despite these extraordinarily low short -\nterm interest rates, longer -term rates for consumers and firms remained well above zero.  The \ncombination of weakening economic conditions and effectively constrained short -term policy \nrates led the Federal Reserve to pursue a strategy of LSAPs  to further ease monetary conditions .  \nBy the nature of the fed funds rate, traditional monetary policy has a more substantial  \ninfluence on the short -term securities market , providing a base from which yields extend across \nthe curve . LSAPs were designed explicitly to depress yields on longer -term securities through \nthe purchase of  large quantities of assets. The initial round of purchases, which commenced in \nDecember of 2008, primarily targeted mortgage -related securities in an effort to put downward \npressure on mortgage rates and to help stabilize housing and financial markets. Ho wever, \nsubsequent rounds of asset purchases included longer -term Treasury securities in a bid to ease \nbroader financial conditions and foster overall economic activity. In these latter rounds of \npurchases, LSAPs evolved from a crisis response mechanism to a more general policy tool used \n\n5 \n to promote the Federal Reserve’s mandate  to foster maximum sustainable employment and stable \nprices.  \n \nJudging t he Benefits and C osts of LSAPs  \nThe use of the balance sheet as an instrument of monetary policy in this manner marked \nan important shift . With no experience on which to rely, the FOMC’s decision to undertake \nbalance sheet po licy was not taken lightly. Arguments in favor of expanding the balance sheet \nfocused on the notion that by depressing longer -term yields and e asing credit conditions , the \nFOMC could provide some stimulus to support the economic recovery. On the other hand , it was \nrecognized that there could be  nontrivial costs associated with providing this experimental \nstimulus . These costs stemmed from the uni ntended consequences LSAPs could have on the \neconomy and financial markets , and the complexities associated with employing and exiting \nfrom such unconventional policy . Ultimately, the FOMC deemed the benefits would outweigh \nthe costs.  \nWhile i t is likely premature to fully judge the  extent of the benefits versus the  costs of \nLSAPs , a consensus of research does suggest  that the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance \nsheet has depressed longer -term interest rates . This has eased financial conditions ,3 although \nsome of this effect assumes that the Federal Reserve will hold the assets it purchase d for a \nprolonged period of time  independent of economic conditions.   \nResearch by my staff suggests that the Fed’s asset holdings continue to place downward \npress ure on longer -term rates today  – as they were intended to do .4 This effect , however, has the \n                                                           \n3 See, for example , Taeyoung Doh,  “The Efficacy of Large -Scale Asset Purchases at th e Zero Lower Bound ,” \nEconomic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Q2 2010. Also,  the Macro Bulletin cited below.  \n4 See, for example , Troy Davig and A. Lee Smith , “Forecasting the Stance of Monetary Policy under Balance Sheet \nAdjustments ,” Macro Bulle tin, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, May 10, 2017.  \n\n6 \n potential to introduce new threats to economic stability going forward . Holding long-term rates  \nbelow the level that they  might otherwise move to  naturally , amidst improving economic \nfundamentals , risks creating financial imbalances . History reminds us  that it may be difficult to \ndetect such imbalances in real time and that they can only become apparent well after they \nmanifest . Looking across a spectrum of a sset classes today, from real estate to equities to \ncorporate bonds, there is reason to remain vigilant despite the apparent tranquility in financial \nmarkets.  \nIn addition to the potential costs associated with using LSAPs, some costs have becom e \nincreasing ly visible as the FOMC begins  to normalize monetary policy. For example, a large \nbalance sheet has made monetary policy more complex today than it was a decade ago. From an \noperational  standpoint, the Federal Reserve has had to rethink its traditional approach to \ntargeting  the federal funds rate in an environment of abundan t reserves. In the process, the \nFederal Reserve has engaged an expanded set of counterparties and thereby e xpanded its \nfootprint in certain financial markets.  \nFrom a communications persp ective, the existence of multiple policy instruments has \nmade explaining  the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy to the public more complicated. With the \nintroduction of LSAPs , the FOMC’s post -meeting statements became lengthier .5 These \nstatements now include not only the traditional policy directive and relevant details regarding \neconomic conditions a nd the outlook, but also address securities holdings acquired under the \nLSAPs.  \n \n                                                           \n5 The first post -meeting  public  statement , issued in 1994 , was a total of about 100 words. The length of policy \nstatements in recent years has increased to average more than 600  words.  \n\n7 \n The Process of Normalizing the Balance S heet \nAt its June 2017 meeting , the FOMC outlined its planned approach for reducing its \nTreasury and agency portfolio. Once initiated, the Committee intends to limit the pace at which \nthe FOMC’s portfolio is unwound by gradually decreasing its reinvestment of the principal \npayments received from maturing securities. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only \nto the extent that they exceed preset rising caps , allowing the balance sheet to shrink  in a slow \nand largely predictable manner.  \nWhile the “how” of balance sheet normalization has be en largely established, the “when” \nand the “how much” remain to be determined . In terms of “when ,” the FOMC has indicated it \nexpects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided the \neconomy evolves broadly as anticipated . One reason I favor shrinking the balance sheet sooner \nrather than later is the observed  disconnect between short -term rates and long -term rates. Despite \nfour 25 -basis -point increases in the target funds rate since December of 2015, longer -term yields \nrema in little changed.  \nAccording to the FOMC’s Summar y of Economic Projections (SEP), the median forecast \nin the so -called “dot plot” anticipates another 25 -basis -point increase in the funds rate this year \nand three more increases next year. If further increa ses in the target funds rate fail to transmit to \nlonger -term yields, the yield curve could flatten further . Such a rate environment can distort \ninvestment decisions. To the extent that reducing our asset holdings will apply some modest \nupward pressure to l onger -term interest rates, balance sheet normalization could promote the  \nmore  typical transmission of short -term interest rate changes throughout the yield curve and \nensure that all components of policy accommodation are removed in a gradual manner.  \n\n8 \n The qu estion of “how much” the Fed’s balance sheet will shrink also is an important \naspect of policy normalization , but has yet to be determined . The FOMC has said that it \nanticipates reducing the amount of reserves, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in \nrecent years but larger than before the financial crisis . The ultimate size of the Fed’s balance \nsheet will be influenced by a number of factors, including the public’s demand for currency in \ncirculation, decisions the FOMC makes about its securiti es portfolio and its long -run operating \nframework , and  the economy . To improve the public’s understanding of balance sheet \ndevelopments, t he Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s public website was  recently updated \nwith projections for the long -run size of the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet .6   \n \nGauging the Implications of Balance Sheet N ormalization  \nI support th e FOMC’s approach to balance sheet normalization and favor initiating the \nprocess in the near future , although  I would  have  prefer red to be starting the process with a \nsmaller balance sheet than exists today . As a voting member of the FOMC  in 2013 , I voted \nagainst  the continuation of the asset purchase program known popularly as QE III. By then, \nfinancial markets were stable and the economy was growing . My concerns about the expansion \nof the Fed’s balance sheet under those conditions  centered on many of the issues I’ve discussed \ntoday. In my view, the possible unintended side effects of the ongoing asset purchases posed \nrisks to economic and financial s tability and served to unnecessarily further complicate future \nmonetary policy. I remain reluctant to advocate for the use of LSAP s in the future  outside \nextraordinary circumstances . \n                                                           \n6 http://libert ystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2017/07/just -released -updated -soma -portfolio -and-income -\nprojections.html  \n\n9 \n It could prove to be the case that my concerns were misplaced . Certainly today’s \nfinancial markets are calm  and labor markets remain robust . Recent “stress tests” suggest that the \nlargest U.S. banks are healthy for the most part . I hope such conditions point to a path of \ncontinued, stable economic growth .  \nYet, my experience reminds me that imbalances can develop in sectors outside the lens of \nregulators and , as we witnessed a decade ago , can  unwind with little warning . The current \ncombination of asset valuations —influenced  in part by LSAPs — together with low levels of \nimplied  volatility in equity and bond markets , could be signal ing broader complacency in \nfinancial markets. For example, the failure of longer -term rates to move up with short -term rates \nduring this normalization cycle illustrates the risk for a disruptive repric ing of assets as markets \nadjust to a more normal policy stance. The potential for such disruption highlights the essential \nnature of ensuring that our largest banks are indeed  well capitalized  and able to withstand the \nrepercussions of a financial shock . Although often noted as higher than a decade ago , equity \ncapital levels in these banks remain well below levels held by the nation’s community banks .7  \nAssuring s trong  capital is particularly critical in light of focused efforts to ease various \nregulatory mechanisms that are designed to off set the systemic risk these large banks pose to the \nnation’s economy . \nAt the same time, the FOMC faces the unprecedented task of normalizing multiple \ndimensions of policy without impeding the economic expansion . Moving too fast could \nexcessively tighten financial conditions and slow the economy. Moving too slow ly could cause a \nrelatively tight labor market to become further stretched beyond what is sustainable in the \nlonger -run. In either case, history shows tha t a policy mistake  can invite a recession .  \n \n                                                           \n7 FDIC Global Capital Index: https://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/board/hoenig/global.html  \n\n10 \n Conclusion  \nEven as short -term interest rates rise, monetary policy remains accommodative . Making \nadjustments to the Fed’s sizeable balance sheet is a necessary  but unfamiliar  part of the FOMC’s \npolicy process . As a result, the Committee has adopted a gradual  approach to its policy \nnormalization  approach . Removing accommodation in small doses , consistent with the pace of \nimprovement in the economy’s fundamentals , should allow Fed policy to evolve from fueling an \neconomic expansion to  sustain ing it."

And its namesake, \nHenry Bloch , serves as a worthy example of the school ’s mission  to develop purposeful, \nentrepreneurial and innovative leaders to meet changing global demands, and advance \nknowledge and practice throug h excellent teaching, scholarship, outreach and service.  \nCongratulations. You’ve earned a college degree , and t hat achievement alone gives you \nan advantageous seat at the table of the U.S. economy . By completing a bachelor ’s or graduate \ndegree, your chances of getting a job are pretty good . Last year, the unemployment rate for \ncollege graduates was only 2.5 percent – it’s more than twice that rate for those with out that level \nof education . 1 And not only are your chances good for landing a job , it’s l ikely that you’ll be \npaid more for it . The median income of a worker  with a Bachelor’s or higher degree is more than \n40 percent above the overall median  income .2  \nThose facts paint a very favorable picture of your future .  Unfortunately , the advantages \nyou have today  are not guarantee s of future success . Take a careful look at your diploma . You \nwon’t see fine print with any such guarantee .  \nThat’s because t omorrow you will join the ranks o f millions of other college graduates  in \na workforce where more than one-third of all workers have at least as much education as you if \nnot more . So w hat happens from here is up to you, but that’s only partially true . Your lot in life \n                                                           \n1 Bureau of Labor Statistics d ata updated April 20, 2017 : https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm  \n2 Note workers age 25 and older.

To put it simply….. Life will happen.  \nSo what exactly does the path to success look like?  Here’s a spoiler alert . I think I know \nmost of the ingredients, but I don’t have the re cipe.  \nWhen I meet with n ew employees at the Kansas City Fed, they often  ask me about my \nown career path and whether I knew early on that I wanted to be the president and CEO of a \nFederal Reserve Bank . The truth is I had no such goal . In fact, I had neither  a plan nor a carefully \nconstructed series of strategic moves to reach the position I’m in today. I was focused on making \na living . Along the way, I worked hard and found the work I did meaningful and challenging. \nAnd each assignment became the rung to the  next one.  \nToday, as I look back at my own path, I can see that any measure of success I realized \nhad much to do with the experiences and lessons I learned along the way .  I’ve condensed those \nyears of experiences and lessons learned into f ive simple rules .  They’ve served me well. A nd as \nyou move into the ranks of the dreamers and doers , you might consider them:  \n1) Be prepared:  There really are no shortcuts to doing your best. Few people can  \nsuccessfully wing it. Most of us have to spend  time and make sacrifices to be prepared for that  \ninterview, to complet e a job assignment  on time , to earn a raise. But that preparation arms  you \nwith knowledge and gives you confidence.  \n2) Be flex ible:  Things won’t always go as planned. And sometimes, we bui ld plans that  \ncan fall apart. If you can learn to accept that  life is unpredictable and full of change, you’ll  be \nable to adapt and cope.  \n3) Be brave : You will have to make choices of consequence. It is not always clear what \nthe right answer is, but make s ure you ask  the right questions . And then choose.  \n\n4) Be humb le: Regardless of how confident you may be, you are not always right.  Listen \ncarefully to others. You might learn  something.  \n5) Be grat eful:  Everyday someone is doing work that makes your job easier, safer and \nless stressful. Look around you today —I suspect  some of those people are right here.  \n \nAs you come to this stage to accept your diploma today, I hope you enjoy the feeling of \naccomplishment . But I would encourage you not to confuse this ac hievement , and those to come , \nwith making your mark in other important ways . As you strive for success – and you should – \nkeep your focus on the things that define who you are and what you stand for :  your values, your \nintegrity, your work ethic , your service to others . These are within your control and these are \nwhat matter in the long run . If you focus on these , regardless of whether you achieve your best \ndreams and hopes, whether you get the next promotion, or secure wealth or fame, you will have \naimed for those things in a principled way .  \nJohn Adams, one of America’s founding fathers , expressed this sentiment well. During \nsome of the darkest days of the American Revolution, he worried about whether the struggle for \nindependence would be won . In a letter to his wife Abigail  in 1776 , he made a profound \nstatement when he wrote , “We can’t guarantee success, but we can deserve it.”  \nAnd so it is for each of you . The degree you are about to receive does not represent what \nyou know, but what you are capable of learning . So choose your path carefully .  Because t he \nworld is looking to you to tackle the challenges we face, to  repair the divisions  we see , and to \nbuild on the opportunities ahead of you . And whatever the outcome, and however success will be \ndefined for you, if you go about it in the right way, y ou too can deserve it."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 9, 2017  \n \nRipple Effects  \nThe University of California, Santa Barbara’s 36th Annual South County Economic Summit  \nSanta Barbara, Calif.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its g overnors, officers or representatives.  \n \n \n\n \n \n1 \n It’s a pleasure to join you today  for this annual Economic Summit . As a Federal Reserve \npolicymaker, I took particular note of the theme for this year’s event . Thinking about the ripple \neffects of monetary policy is  something that occupies a great deal of my time and focus . Not only \nconsidering how those effects ripple through the economy but also how they ripple through time \nand the implications that those policy actions can have well into the future.  \nToday, I am go ing to be sharing with you my views on recent economic developments \nalong with my thoughts on the outlook for the national economy and the appropriate course of \nmonetary policy. I want to stress that these views are my own and not those of the Federal \nRese rve System.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nThe U.S. economy’s average 2 percent growth rate is quite modest by historical \nmeasures . Expansions dating back to 1961 have produced growth of some 4.1 percent  on \naverage . But what this current expansion has lacked in strength, it has made up for in longevity . \nApril  marks the 94th consecutive month of growth, making it the third -longest U.S. expansion on \nrecord going back to about 1850 .  \nOver this recovery, the  U.S. economy has witnessed a remarkable impro vement in labor \nmarkets . The unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 4. 4 percent today.  \nGranted, this is a broad measure , and it is true that some areas of the labor market could benefit \nfrom further improvement . Rather than picking and choos ing which indicators best describe the \nstate of the labor market , Kansas City Fed staff looked at how we could summarize 24 different \nlabor market variables  by creating two indicators : one that looks at the level of labor market \nactivity , and the  other at the momentum of that activity . The most recent results confirm \n\n \n \n2 \n continued strength . Both indicators were above their  historical average s, suggesting a somewhat \n“tight” labor market with forward momentum pointing to continued improvement.  In fact, the \nmomentum indicator is at its highest lev el in the history of the series, which goes back to the \nearly 1990s.  \n With labor markets showing little or no slack, why then did real Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP)  only grow 0.7 percent in the first qua rter?  Importantly, does  this weakness call for the \nFederal Reserve to pause its process of normalizing monetary policy?   \nFor a number of reasons , I think the answer is “No .”  \n First, some of the weakness reflects unusually mild winter weather that led consumer \nspending on housing and utilities to  decline sharply in  the first quarter. Although such an effect \ntemporarily reduces measured output, it is  clearly not cause for concern. In fact, household \nsaving increased  by over half of a percentage point bet ween December and March, likely \nreflecting lower utility bills.  \nThe second reason  is a more  technical one  – what economists call “residual seasonality .” \nNamely, despite the best effort of statisticians to smooth through predictable seasonality , we \nhave seen a pattern emerge in recent years in which measured growth is weak er in the first \nquarter than it is  during  the rest of the year . I suspect  we are seeing  this same dynamic , at least in \npart, in 2017.   \nThe third reason is that economic data is subject to dips and spikes . Despite best efforts, \nmeasuring a dynamic, $ 19 trillion dollar economy is an extremely difficult task . As a result, w e \nshould be ca reful not to overreact to  every move in reported data. To illustrate some of the \nchallenges in me asuring economic activity, m y staff recently issued a report on the so -called \nsharing economy,  a business model in which customers who are looking for rides  or rooms, \n\n \n \n3 \n among other goods and services, are matched with providers via online platforms.1 While this \ntype of activity remains too small to affect our understanding of recent macroeconomic trends, \nthe report highlights some of the difficulties statisticians face when trying to capture emerging \neconomic trends .  \nAs we consider these factors  affecting the nation’s GDP , we are likely seeing a \nsignificant amount of noise. The core signal, I believe, may have more strength than what we are \ncurrently able to determine.  \nStill, interpreting the data is a balancing act . Just as one should not overreact t o each \nsingle data point , it is important to watch for signal s that could mark a turn in the economy . For \nexample , one area I am watching closely is auto sales. After setting a record last year with 17.5 \nmillion light weight vehicles sold, the pace of vehi cle sales slowed  in the first quarter. Recently -\nreleased data for April  did rebound a bit to just under 17 million on an annualized basis, but sales \nremain below last year’s level . Some cooling raise s questions about softening consumer  demand . \nOn the other  hand , indicators of consumer sentiment remain high, gas prices remain low , \nhousehold balance sheets are, on average, healthy and other fundamentals suggest consumers \nhave the ability to continue spending.  \nAll told, w hile the recent GDP report  and auto sal es may be flashing yellow, numerous \nother indicators remain solid  green. In particular, consumer and business confidence remain \nstrong, as do s urveys of business conditions . For example, the  ISM manufacturing index, which \nsurveys manufacturing firms across the U.S. about business conditions, has been signaling a \nstrengthening manufacturing sector over the last eight months . Its nonmanufacturing counterpart, \nwhich covers the broader se rvices s ectors , has also been solid as of late .  \n                                                           \n1 Redmond, Michael. 2017 . “Waiting for a Pickup: GDP and the Sharing Economy ,” Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, The Macro Bulletin , April.  \n\n \n \n4 \n Likewise, global economic conditions have improved, supporting exports, and downside \nrisks posed by China and Europe have diminished . Given the strength of fundamentals across a \nrange of sectors, I expect the econom y to continue growing at a slightly above -trend rate.  \nWith this outlook, I view inflation  dynamics as broadly consistent with the Federal \nReserve’s goal of price stability . Personal consumption expenditure ( PCE) inflation was 1.8 \npercent over the past yea r after averaging just 1 percent for much of 2016 , and core inflation has \nbeen trending up . Its unexpected decline in March  appears to reflect some one -off factors as \nopposed to broader disinflationary pressure . It seems reasonable to l ook through this volatility, \nwith labor markets continuing to improve, and longer -term inflation expectations staying \nanchored near 2 percent.  \n \nThe Balance of Risks  \n Developing an outlook for the economy requires not only judging the health of the \neconomy over a medium -term horizon, but also requires an assessment of the nature of risks to \nthat forecast . Now that the U.S. has  largely  recovered from the Great Recession  – the \nunemployment rate is below its estimated longer -run level , real gross domestic produ ct (GDP ) is \ngrowing slightly above its estimated trend, and inflation is near the Federal Open Market \nCommittee’s (FOMC)  longer -run objective of 2 percent  – I will turn to my thoughts on the \nbalance of risks . And here I would point out an important shift  in the FOMC’s assessment of \nrisks since it took its first steps to normalize monetary policy in December 2015 .  \nAt th at time, inflation was moving closer to the FOMC’s desired 2 percent objective , and \nthe labor market reflected substantial improvement . How ever, nearly half of the FOMC \n\n \n \n5 \n participants continued to view the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside – highlighting \nconcerns that inflation might start to move further below the objective.  \nA year later, with sustained improvements in the labor market and progress toward the \nCommittee’s inflation objective, the FOMC took a second step toward monetary policy \nnormalization , raising short -term interest rates another 25 basis points . By then , the assessment \nof risks had changed . An overwhelming majority of participants viewed  the risk to their inflation \nforecasts for 2017 as broadly balanced, and a few more  report ed that risks were weighted more \nto the upside  than the downside.   \nThe same is true for judgments about risk to the outloo k for the unemployment rate . A \nlarge majority currently  sees risks as broadly balanced, but a few participants see risks that the \nunemployment rate is more likely to be even lower than their projection.  \n The assessment that risks to the unemployment rate a re balanced right now  is a \nreasonable one, although having the unemployment rate fall below its longer -run level  is not \nwithout risk . At 4. 4 percent, the unemployment rate is  already below the FOMC’s median \nestimate of the longer -run unemployment rate , and overshooting poses risk to the sustainab ility \nof the expansion . Past e pisodes to push unemployment lower than its longer -run level have \nended in recession, and for that reason, adjusting policy to ensure the economy remains on a \nsustainable growth tr ajectory is of paramount importance.  \nOthers may argue that concerns about the economy potentially overheating  are \nexaggerated. For example, the link between low unemployment and rising wages is weaker than \nit was a few decades ago. This means tighter labo r markets may be  unlikely to generate as much \ninflation as in the past. While I acknowledge that the link between real activity and inflation \nappears to have diminished, there could very well be conditions when the relationship reasserts \n\n \n \n6 \n itself. That is, under tight labor markets, employees may find themselves with significantly more \nbargaining power to negotiate for higher wage s, which in turn could translate into more \ninflationary pressure.  \nAnother point often raised to suggest  the Fed eral Reserve  need not be overly concerned \nwith tight labor markets is that inflation has been running below the FOMC’s 2 percent goal  for \nan extended period . Such low rates of inflation seem to have lowered longer -run inflation \nexpectations. Given the infla tion goal is symmetric, meaning that the Committee gives equal \nweight to deviations above and below the goal, some argue there is scope to let inflation drift \nabove 2 percent for a time, particularly if it would help anchor expectations more firmly around \n2 percent.   \nI have not yet found this argument compelling . The most recent estimate from the Survey \nof Professional Forecasters points to future levels of inflation slightly  above the FOMC’s 2 \npercent goal. In fact, s ome consumer expectations of inflation have slipped, but not sufficiently \nto suggest they have become fundamentally unanchored from the inflation goal.  \n \nMonetary Policy  \nLast week, t he FOMC took no action  to change policy , although it remains on a path to \nremove accommodation in a gradual manner . Given my own economic outlook and assessment \nof the balance of risks, I support this policy path .  \nIt is worth noting that e ven as the FOMC has increased short -term rates , financial \nconditions remain accommodative . Looking a t the Kansas City Fed ’s Financial Stress Index , \nwhich synthesizes 11 financial market v ariables , the index has generally declined over the past \n\n \n \n7 \n six months despite two rate increases . Thus, t he modest amount of removal of monetary \naccommodation has had little notable effect on broader financial conditions.  \nLooking ahead, a  natural question is how gradual will the monetary policy normalization \nprocess be?  According to the Fed’s Survey of Economic Projections , the median calls for another \n2 moves this year  and f inancial markets appear to expect another 1 or 2 moves . The FOMC has \njudged that m oving gradually  is appropriate . Understandably, moving too aggressively risks \nslowing economic activity  or even derail ing the expansion . Removing accommodation in small \ndoses is consistent wi th the economy’s improving fundamentals  and perceived benign rates of \ninflation.  \nAlternatively , policy cannot move  too gradually. Postponing the removal of \naccommodation when the economy is at full employment and inflation near 2 percent poses  risks \nto longer-run economic and financial stability . Moving too slow ly carries the risk of pushing the \nunemployment rate below its sustainable rate  and inviting recession  as history shows . Failing to \nkeep interest rates in line with improving fundamentals also can distort the allocation of capital \ntoward less fruitful, or perhaps excessively risky, endeavors .  \nAs monetary policy continues on a gradual path of tightening, questions emerge about the \nimpact to those sectors of the economy that are especially interest r ate sensitive . This concern is \noften associated with the housing sector . However, I would note that t he housing market  has \nchanged significantly over the past decade. While demand fueled rising home prices  prior to the \nfinancial crisis , it seems that lack of supply is now the dominant factor. For example, research by \nmy staff suggests the number of households is at least 3.5 million below its trend, even after \naccounting for demographics and changes in preferences. The unmet demand for housing may \nface a more persistent lack of supply, due in part to limited land available for development  in \n\n \n \n8 \n desirable areas . Conditions vary across regions, but with a limited supply of housing  and a strong \nlabor market , prices are likely to continue rising  even as interest ra tes gradually go up . Even with \nsuch conditions, while h igher home prices may boost measures of household wealth, those  \nhouseholds that spend a relatively larger share of their income on shelter  will face challenges.  \n Finally, removing policy accommodation  goes beyond increasing the level of the federal \nfunds rate . The FOMC also must begin to adjust the size and composition of its securities \nholdings . The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is currently about $4.5 trillion , or almost 25 \npercent of GDP compared to 6 percent of GDP 10 years ago . The composition of this balance \nsheet has changed as well . Ten years ago, the balance sheet was primarily comprised of short -\nterm Treasuries . Today, mortgage -backed a nd agency securities make up about 40 percent of \nassets .  \nWith these changes, the FOMC faces unprecedented challenges for its decision -making \ntoday, such as when to begin the process  of reducing the size and altering the composition , and \nhow to communicate the approach and the timing to the public . My own view is that the process \nshould begin sometime this year by reducing reinvestments in mortgage -backed securities \n(MBS)  and long -term Treasury securities . Once it begins, however, the runoff in the portfolio  \nshould be on autopilot and not reconsidered at  each subsequent FOMC meeting . Otherwise, the \nCommittee w ould need to re -evaluate and make adjustments that will potentially complicate \nmonetary policy and provide few benefits to the real economy.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe economy continues to expand as sustained j ob growth and solid gains in household \nspending  – the weak first quarter notwithstanding  – are mutually reinforcing. The international \n\n \n \n9 \n backdrop poses less downside risks today, further supporting growth at home. In this \nenvironment, the role for monetary p olicy is to support the sustainability of the expansion. \nTherefore, a s labor markets continue to tighten, continuing the gradual removal of monetary \naccommodation is the appropriate course for the FOMC."

        "content": "Strategies for Improving t he U.S. Payment s System: Maintaining the Momentum  \n \n \nRemarks by  \n \nEsther L. George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 4, 2017  \nFaster Payments Task Force Meeting  \nChicago, Ill.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the \nFederal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n \n\n1 \n Good morning.  It is my pleasure to join you today  to recognize the tremendous \ncontributions you’ve made to this public -private effort aimed at improving t he nation’s \npayments infrastructure .  This is one of the most ambitious undertakings in the history of \nour country’s payment s system and one that is essential to the growing and evolving \ndemands of businesses and consumers .  I also want to thank Gordon Werkema and his \nteam  for the expertise and leadership they’ve brought to this engagement  on behalf of the \nFede ral Reserve . \nCharting a course for faster payments has been demanding, but the progress \nwe’ve seen is rewarding .  It signals that even as more work lies ahead, we can build on \nthe experience of the past two years to achieve the desired outcomes  identified in the \n2015 paper Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment  System .  This morning, I’d like to \ntalk briefly about the progress achieved to date  and then offer my thoughts on  the road \nahead for the Fed eral Reserve  and the payments industry .  \nBefore I continue, now would be a good time to remind  you that the views I \nexpress here  are my own and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.  \n \nProgress report  \nIn 2012, the Fed eral Reserve  was among those noting that the U.S. payment \nsystem was undergoing a period of rapid change , and contemplating the implications . \nConsumers and businesses were turning increasingly to e -commerce and Internet -enabled \ntechnologies.  In the midst of this transition, payment security was being challenged by \nnew, dyn amic, and escalating threats.  \nTraditional payment services had been adj usting slowly to these changes , while \nemerging players were coming to market with innovative product offerings .  Avoiding \n\n2 \n fragmentation and facilitating end -to-end adoption required a more coordinated rather \nthan organic approach  to ensure that issues of access and security could be broadly \nconsidered . \nA path forward took shape with extensive industry dialogue in the form of the \nStrategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System  paper pub lished in 2015.  Within the \npaper were strategies based on five desired outcomes for improvements in the following \nareas: speed, security, efficiency, cross -border payments and industry collaboration.  \nAs this group knows better than anyone, industry stake holders and the Federal \nReserve have invested significantly over the past two years in efforts to advance toward \nthe desired outcomes outlined in that paper.  While some thought our efforts would fall \nvictim to proprietary interests and a lack of cooperati on, substantial measureable progress \nhas been made on a number of issues and there is significant momentum towards \naddressing some of the more intractable issues that will demand a more sustained focus.  \nEarlier this year , the Task Force released Part One  of its final report and I look \nforward to seeing Part Two  when it becomes available this summer .  Once completed, \nthis document will share assessments of proposals for faster payments solutions and \nrecommend next steps for the industry to take to achieve safe and accessible faster \npayments capabilities.  Together, these documents will provide a comprehensive report of \nthe Task Force’s work.  Feedback from private sector providers suggests they have found \nthis work to be worthwhile and promising  as they see k to design and deliver faster \npayment capabilities to end users.  \nOf course , while th e Task Force has been at work  on these issues , the payment s \nsystem has continued to evolve .  Innovation and new capabilities have emerged from the \nprivate sector and the Federal Reserve also has continued to improve the services it \n\n3 \n provides .  For example, same -day ACH credit payments began flowing through the \nnetworks last fall, with 13 million payments cleared same -day in the first 100 days.  \nAlthough not real -time, this development is an important and tangible step toward faster  \npayments in the United States.  Additionally, g lobal messaging standards (ISO 20022) \nhave been adopted for better interoperability .  Innovations in the card space now facilitate \nreal-time P2P tran sfers via credit push.  And many fintech and social media entities are \ndelivering payment services with some real -time attributes through stored value or card \non file models.  The payments industry is also exploring models that leverage virtual \ncurrency an d distributed ledger technology in delivering faster payment solutions.  \n \nThe Road Ahead  \nWhile the efforts of the Federal Reserve and the Faster Payments Task Force have \ndriven significant progress , we recognize that the desired outcomes identified in the 2015 \npaper have yet to be realized .  With continuing technological innovation and the \nemergence of new potential security threats, real work remains if we are to achieve and \nmaintain a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments capability.  \nOngoing innovation and m arket activity, including a variety of proposals \nreviewed by the Task Force , suggests the potential for multiple solutions in the faster \npayments market.  However, the lack of established industry standards and rules could \nhinder interoperability  of these solutions, resulting in fragmentation and inhibiting \ncompetition over time .  Such conditions could  negatively affect the ability to “pay \nanyone” and constrain access and adoption. Study of the payment system also teaches \nthat over time, consolida tion of providers seeking economies of scale and scope may \noccur, adversely affecting competition, an essential ingredient to innovation and serving \n\n4 \n the needs of consumer and business end users.  I am encouraged by the amount of \nattention that you’ve given to considering these kinds of critical issues  and challenges . \nFurther progress is needed in other aspects as well .  As highlighted in the \nStrategies paper, developing settlement services to support real -time payments  is yet to \nbe addressed .  Faster payment  capabilities that rely on current settlement systems would \nhave end user service gaps or real -time end user service offerings with deferred \nsettlement.  Deferred interbank settlement could create credit or liquidity risks for \nfinancial institutions and po tential risk for the financial system.  We will continue to \nwork with the industry to understand such issues  as solutions are implemented.  \n \nThe Federal Reserve’s role  \nOver the next decade, I anticipate that changes to the payment s system will only \naccelerate, but in uncertain ways .  As it has done in the past, the nature of the Federal \nReserve ’s engagement going forward will likely evolve.  \nThe Faster Payments Task Force is only the most recent example  of the \ncooperation between the Fed eral Reserve  and the private sector that has historically \ncontributed to a more efficient and effective payments system .  This history include s the \ndevelopment of routing numbers, the growth of the automated clearing house network \nand the crafting of Check 21 legislatio n. \nA secure and smooth -functioning payments system is a critical component of \neconomic growth and stability.  Recognizing this, the Federal Reserve has sought to \npromote its “integrity and efficiency  … and to ensure the provision of payment services \nto all depository institutions on an equitable basis … in an atmosphere of competitive \n\n5 \n fairness.”1    \nThe Federal Reserve’s dual role as an operator and regulator  in the U.S. payments \nsystem is  often viewed as unique  relative to approaches in other countries .  Throughout \nU.S. history, consumers, merchants, financial institutions, policymakers and others have \ngrappled with the question of who is ultimately responsible for what congressional \nleaders in 1913 called the “highways of commerce .”  From the chaos of the early 19th \ncentury through  today’s digital transactions, there has been a spirited deb ate over the \ncentral bank’s roles and responsibilities.2   \nToday’s  active participation in a range of activities  position s the Federal Reserve \nto bring perspective and insight to the challenges and emerging issues affecting the \npayments landscape .  While some public authorities in other countries have acted based \non explicit mandates, the Fed eral Reserve has leveraged the experience of its existing \ncentral bank roles to serve as a catalyst for critical improvement to the payments systems.  \nIn this role, we have facilitate d the important work of the more than 300 individuals \ninvolved in the Task Force.  And, as is noted in the strategies paper, the Federal Reserve \nremains  committed to serving as a leader, convener and catalyst as appropriate to foster a \nwell-functioning payments system for the public . \nI very much look forward to continuing our work  with the industry to shape  the \nnecessary improvements in our  payments system that support confidence, economic \ngrowth and global competitiveness going forwa rd. \n                                                           \n1 The Federal Reserve in the Payments System , revised 1990  \n2 See: Medley, Bill.

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \nApril 18, 2017 \n26\nth Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference  \nLevy Economics Institute of Bard College  \nAnnandale -on-Hudson, N.Y. \n \n      The views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives. \n\n1 \n I’d like to thank the organizers of this year’s Mins ky C onference for inviting me to speak. \nThe topics to be addressed at this event highlight a number of policy choices facing our nation \ntoday . The implications of those choices are far -reaching not only to the Main Streets of this \ncountry but also to economies  around the world. Central bank monetary policies loom large \namong those policy choices .  \nOver the past 15 months, the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) has begun the  \nprocess of gradually removing nearly a decade of monetary accommodation. Th at \naccommodation came in the form of both conventional interest rate policy , which lowered short -\nterm rates to near zero, and a series of more unconventional policy actions  – namely , large -scale \nasset purchases  and forward guidance . The actions  were both lauded and critic ized. Indeed, in \nMarch 2009, one member of the FOMC commented  on the very difficult situation of determining \nan appropriate policy response  at that time , noting “we’re in a position where doing the right \nthing is not obvious.”1    \nIf doing “the right thing” was not obvious at that time , then the path to unwinding these \nextraordinary policy actions  and returning to more conventional policy approaches is no less \nfraught with questions about the FOMC’s decision -making framework . How will conventional \nand unconventional policy accommodation be removed and what are the implications ? Is the \nprocess of normalizing policy “behind the curve ?” What linkages exist between balance sheet \nadjustment s and interest rates ? What level of interest  rates  best supports long -run price stability ? \nMy r emarks today will not attempt to answer many of these important questions . Instead, \nI will focus on the process of policy normalization and its challenges , particularly as it relates to \nunwinding the Federal Res erve’s balance sheet . I’ll begin with the economic backdrop under \nwhich the FOMC is considering these policy adjustments.  \n                                                           \n1 Donald Kohn, FOMC meeting transcript, March 17- 18, 2009.  \n\n2 \n The views I express are my own and are not necessarily shared by other participants on \nthe FOMC.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nFor the most part, t he economy looks to be on solid footing. Consumers are confident and \nthey are spending , household balance sheets are in better shape , and house prices are rising . \nEmployment has gained traction, bringing the unemployment rate down to 4.5 percent . Business \ninvestment and productivity growth ha ve been somewhat sluggish for most of the recovery, but \nprofitability has again increased . The energy and manufacturing sectors also are bouncing back \nwith the stabilization in oil prices and the fore ign exchange value of the U .S. dollar . In general, \nthe economy has come a very long way since the financial crisis that began nearly a decade ago  \nand has weathered a number of shocks over the course of this lengthy  expansion.  \nDespite the apparent health of the economy, r isks are always on the horizon. Today, \nhowever, there is a sense that outcomes could actually  be better than expected, rather than worse. \nFor example, in the FOMC’s latest Summary of Economic Projections, more participants now \nsee risks th at real GDP growth and inflation could  be higher than forecast, rather than lower. \nThis shift in risk assessment is in sharp c ontrast  to the more pessimistic view s that dominate d \npast projections . Such an outlook has allowed the  FOMC to continue  the proces s of \nnormalization.  \n \nUnwinding the B alance S heet \nPrior to the financial crisis, the business of setting monetary policy involved few moving \nparts . FOMC decisions could be steered with a fair amount of precision by the Federal Reserve’s \n\n3 \n Open Market Desk and with a relatively modest amount of intervention in financial markets. \nThere were other aspects to the process, but the tools and considerations were generally well \nunderstood and relatively  straightforward . \nToday, conducting monetary policy is consider ably more complicated , owing in part  to \nthe size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet . Prior to the financial crisis  and \nrecession , the Fed’s balance sheet was slightly less than $1 trillion with a portfolio of short -term \nTreasuries . Over  the period from 2009 to 2014, a series of large- scale asset purchases swelled the \nbalance sheet to nearly  $4.5 trillion, and the portfolio shifted to include mortgage -backed \nsecurities and long -term Treasur ies.  \nThese unprecedented actions were carefully considered with a desire to boost economic \nactivity . Faced with the prospect of potential nearer -term benefits, the associated costs  were \ngenerally difficult to quantify and viewed to be well into the future, perhaps making them easier \nto discount . As a voting member who dissented in 2013, I believed these costs outweighed the \nbenefits  at that time . \nThe key challenge for monetary policy today  is to unwind this large balance sheet  in the \nleast disruptive manner . It is an important step and one that  the FOMC a nticipated  going back to \nJune 2011 when exit strategy principles were initially framed . Following decisions to expand the \nbalance sheet further, the  FOMC revisited the exit strategy principles in 2014 and outlined its \napproach to monetary policy  normalization  in September of that year .  \nIt is difficult to know with a high degree of confidence just how the economy and \nfinancial markets will react once the FOMC announces and then takes steps to reduce the size of \nits securities holdings . Some believe that the benefits of the actions that swelled the balance sheet \nwere modest, and as a result, the costs of its unwinding  also could be of little consequence to the \n\n4 \n broader economy . Others believe that t he eff ects on the economy were substantial  and that  \nactions to reduce its size need to be taken with a great deal of care and caution . Of course, it is \nalso possible that any  benefits gained from the balance sheet  expansion w on’t reverse when it \nshrinks . While evidence from a variety of  sources and studies will inform decisions about \npossible effects and how to proceed, the implications for the economy are uncertain.  \nIn addition, balance sheet actions have the potential to complicate interest rate policy. \nThere is likely some tradeoff between adjusting interest rates and shrinking the balance sheet, but \nthe specifics of the tradeoff are hard  to quantify. This uncertainty and additional complexity \nraises the risk of a policy error or could spark a bout of financial market volatility .  \nBeyond the mechanics of shrinking a large balance sheet, establishing a sound framework \nfor the timing of balance sheet adjustments will be important. To that end, the FOMC discussed at its most recent meeting in March various aspects of a n appropriate decision- making \nframework to guide its actions . \nBalance sheet adjustments will need to be gradual  and smooth, which is an approach that \ncarries the least risk in terms of a strategy to normalize its size . Importantly, once the process \nbegins, it should continue without re consideration at each subsequent FOMC meeting . In other \nwords, the process should be on autopilot and not necessarily vary with moderate movements in the economic data . To do otherwise would amount to using the balance sheet as an active tool of \npolicy outside of periods of severe financial or economic stress , and would increase uncert ainty \nrather than reduce it .  \n   \n\n5 \n Avoiding Monetary “Fine Tuning”  \nBased on economic conditions, I would support beginning the process of reducing the \nbalance sheet this year . This would further normalize the stance of policy and leave more highly  \nliquid, safe securities available to the market . I do not favor prolonging action for the purpose of \nallow ing inflation  to overshoot the 2 percent goal or to press labor markets into a condition \nwhere they are overheating .  \nAt the time the FOMC adopted the 2 percent  inflation target in 2012, the unfamiliar \nnature and unknown consequences of large scale asset purchases had piqued concerns about the \nimplications for inflation expectations . Anchoring these expectations with a  more  explicit \ncommitment to price stability  was appropriate. I supported that decision. In the years following, \nhowever, i nflation ran below the  stated target  – although at times only slightly below – and only \nrecently has it moved above the target to 2.1 percent .  \nIn its annual S tatement on Longer -Run G oals and Monetary Policy S trateg y, the FOMC \ntalks about the nature of its inflation objective . Specifically, inflation that persistently deviates \nabove or below the 2 percent objective would be cause for concern, but monetary policy  need not \nreact to  temporary deviations . Importantly, I do not interpret the strategy as calling for inflation \nto linger above 2 percent to make up for past shortfalls, but rather for inflation to move toward 2 percent in the long run without any deliberat e overshooting . Continuing highly accommodative \npolicy or adjusting monetary policy in response to modest shortfalls or overshoots from the inflation goal is an attempt at  monetary fine tuning that is often not practical and may ultimately \nprove costly .  \nAlthough inflation is running close to 2 percent today and is expected to remain there, the \nprices of different goods and services rise at very different rates . For example, services inflation \n\n6 \n has been running well above 2 percent, and housing rents in part icular have been playing a key \nrole in moving inflation higher . By several measures, rents are rising faster than aggregate \nwages . Keeping monetary policy easy to achieve higher inflation has the potential to push rents \nstill higher, negatively affecting a  large percentage of households. Consequently, I am not as \nenthusiastic or encouraged as some when I see inflation moving higher, especially when it has \nbeen driven by a sector like housing . Inflation is a tax and t hose least able to afford it  generally \nsuffer the most .  \nSuch concentration and persistently rising prices in one area suggests the economy is \nstruggling to reallocate resources . For housing, it could reflect several factors such as tight \nlending standards faced by home builders and scarcity of skilled craftsmen needed to construct homes. I expect the market to eventually solve  for, or at least adapt  to, such factors . Using \nmonetary policy however to compensate for them  could easily end up hurting the population the \npolicy is intended to help. \n \nConclusion  \nOverall , I am encouraged by the sta rt of the normalization process and want to see it \ncontinue . Resisting the temptation to react to near -term fluctuations in the data  will be necessary . \nLooking ahead, w e should expect inflation to move up and down around 2 percent . A modest \ndecline in inflation  or an overshoot  may not necessarily warrant  the monetary policy  \nnormalization process to slow or accelerate. Such attempts at monetary fine -tuning can easily \nbackfire, so a more forward looki ng view of inflation is needed . This is not uncommon and it is \nwhy many economists and policymakers emphasize the importance of inflation expectations . In \n\n7 \n fact, t he FOMC also has long -emphasized their importance , typically with specific mention in \neach FOMC statement .  \nThe important factor is that the public, markets, and policymakers see the setting for \nmonetary policy supporting the 2 percent inflation goal in the long run, rather than expect a \npolicy that  tries  to keep inflation squarely pinned at 2 percent under all circumstances.  \nWhile both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are in range to meet the FOMC’s \nobjectives, the federal funds rate is  far from its longer- run level  and the balance sheet remains \nlarge with reinvestment of maturing securities . Continuing along the path of normalization  even \nin the face of uncertainty is necessary to achieving long -run objectives for the economy , \nincluding price stability and full employment on a sustained basis."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 6 , 2017  \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York Community Banking Conference  \nNew York, N.Y.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n2 \n Community banks have an important connection with the Federal Reserve . Across the 12 \nFederal  Reserve Banks, some 68 bankers serve as directors on either Reserve Bank or  Branch \nboards and nearly all of them are community bankers . These individuals bring important \nperspectives to our work . I appreciate their contributions as well as  the core function that \ncommunity banks  serve in thousands of communities across  the United States.  \nI hope you’ll indulge me as I briefly preface my remarks this morning with some \npersonal history . Yesterday marked a milestone for me:  35 years of service with the Federal \nReserve . When I came to work for the Kansas City Fed as a bank examiner in 1982 , I was also a \nfirst-time homeowner. I was delighted to have a job that would help me pay my bills, especially \nmy mortgage . At that time, I thought I’d made a s teal to have assumed a n existing  mortgage at \nthe low rate  of 12 percent.  \nWorking at  the Fed, I soon came to appreciate that it was a particularly challenging year \nfor the banking industry . Our  region was hard hit by the trifecta of downturn s in commercial real \nestate , energy and ag riculture . That year, the failure of a small bank in Oklahoma triggered the \nfailure and eventual government bailout of one of the largest bank s in the U .S. Meanwhile, \nhundreds of banks failed in the Tenth District. This was the en vironment in which I was trained \nto be a bank supervisor .  \nThis also was the year that a former N ew York Fed president , Gerald Corrigan , wrote an \nessay  titled  “Are Banks Specia l?”1  It proved to be a foundational piece that has been \noccasionally revisited  by others in the 35 years  since . Today, I would like to return to the theme \nof Mr. Corrigan’s essay by looking at the role of banks while asking a slightly different question, \n“Do traditional banks still matter to the U.S. economy? ”    A spoiler alert: M y answer is a \n                                                 \n1 E. Gerald  Corrigan served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis from 1980 to 1984 and \npresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1985 to 1993.  \n\n3 \n definitive “yes.” I’ll use the remainder of my time today outlining why this is so , and why I \nbelieve this key component of the U .S. economy may be at risk.  \nBefore going further, I should note that my comments today are my views only and not \nthose of the Federal Reserve System or its Board of Governors.  \n \nThe Banking Landscape  in 1982  \nIn an interview some years later, Mr. Corrigan recalled the reason he wrote the 1982 \nessay. Simply put, t he competitive position of traditional banks was rapidly eroding, and \npolicymakers were contemplating the implications.  \nIn the early 1980s , the combination of high interest rates and deposit rate ceilings made it \ndifficult for banks to  compete with alternatives that were not subject to the same restrictions, \nincluding savings and loan NOW accounts and money market mutual funds . By the time interest \nrate ceilings were eliminated  on most deposits , money market f unds were well established .  \nIn credit markets, the seeds of greater capital market competition for bank loans were \nalso planted in the early 1980s . The development of government and age ncy mortgage -backed \nsecurities were  followed by private  label mortgage and other asset -backed securities . Another \nmajor innovation was funding new credits with high -yield bond s, which previously had been \nused only to refinance companies whose debt had been downgraded below  investment grade .  \nGiven the dramatic nature of these changes, questions arose about whether the role of \nbanks had been diminished.  W ould these new nonbank entrants  supplant their role?  Did it \nmatter?   \nWith reflection on these questions, Mr. Corrigan  concluded that banks were different and \nunique in three ways :   \n\n4 \n  Only banks offered transaction deposits payable on demand at par and readily \ntransferable;   \n Banks served as the primary and ultimate source of liquidity for all other classes and \nsizes of institutions, both financial and nonfinancial;  \n Banks served as the transmission mechanism for monetary policy which , combined \nwith operating the payments mechanis m, facilitates efficient markets and ord erly end \nof day settlement – a particularly important role in periods of financial stress .  \nAt that time, these special characteristics of banks had three important implications for \nthe structure of our financial sys tem and its regulation :   \n No other type of financial company had its funding protected by the public safety net \nof federal deposit insurance and the Federal Reserve discount window .  \n Banks were regulated and supervised because of th is safety net and th eir key role in \nthe economy . At that time, the separation of commercial banking from investment \nbanking and commerce was an important part of the prudential regulatory structure .  \n Only banks had direct access to the Federal Reserve’s payments rails .  \nFrom 1982  to 1999, the financial system continued to evolve, aided by regulatory \ninterpretation and court decisions . And the banking industry began to experience rapid  \nconsolidation . Much of the consolidation reflected mergers of smaller banks as intrastate and \ninterstate restrictions were relaxed . However, the most significant effect for the banking system \nwas an increase in the market share of the largest banks, driven by their efforts to create \nnationwide operations and enhance global competitiveness . During this  period, the market share \nof the ten largest banking companies increased from 28  percent  to 51 percent of total banking \nassets.  \n\n5 \n The scale of these firms made it profitable to operate securities dealing and underwriting \nsubsidiaries under the Glass -Steagal l Act’s Section 20 authority . This was the first major crack in \nthe wall between commercial and investment banking.  In 1999, Glass -Steagall gave way to the \nGramm -Leach -Bliley Act (GLBA) , which  invited bank holding companies to adopt investment \nbanking activities  with important safety net advantages .  \nWith the  addition of these nonbanking activities , the 10 largest bank ing organization s \nsaw their market share rise further to 55 percent  in 2007. Meanwhile, the composition of their \nassets changed dramatica lly. The average portfolio share of nonbanking assets  rose from only 13 \npercent in 1997 to 25 percent in 2007 .  \nThis summer marks the tenth  anniversary of the financial crisis . That event brought to \nlight what had previously only been conceptually understo od:  the largest banking organizations \nwere highly interconnected and indeed  too big to fail (TBTF) . The safety net designed  to cover \nonly commercial banking activities  was stretched well beyond the insured depository \nsubsidiaries to the ir parent companies and nonbanking subsidiaries . However, only commercial \nbanks truly retained the unique characteristics that Mr. Corrigan argued made them special.  \nAs a practical matter, t he largest banks were the only firms that could acquire other large \nand troubled investment banks, commercial banks, and savings associations . The remaining large \nindependent investment banks became bank holding companies . As a result, the 10 largest \nbank ing organizations  now account for 67 percent of industry assets, whil e the average \nnonbanking -asset share of their portfolios has climbed to 29 percent .  \nAs I look through the lens of the past 35 years, the financial system landscape has \ncertainly changed. There are three  features that I find particularly striking  over this period . \n\n6 \n  Banking system assets as a share of financial system assets have fallen from 37 to 19 \npercent .  \n The number of banks has significant ly decline d from more than 18,000 to around  \n5,000, largely reflected in fewer community banks with less than $100 million of \nassets .  \n Community banks’ market share  fell from 45 percent in 1982 to just 13 percent today .  \nWhat has emerged within the banking system are two very different kinds of commercial \nbank ing firm s:  a small number of very large bank ing o rganization s with significant nonbanking \nactivities and sufficient scale to pose systemic risk to the economy , and thousands of traditional \nbanks generally referred to as community banks.  \n \nDo Traditional Banks M atter to the U .S. Economy in 2017 ? \nDespite such monumental shifts in the financial system landscape, one could reach the \nsame conclusion today as Mr. Corrigan did in 1982 . Namely, that the banking system retains a \nunique role in our economy . Banks are still the only type of financial firm t hat can provide \nliquidity whenever needed, ensure payments are readily transferable, and aid the implementation \nof monetary policy .  \nYet, the differences  between the largest banks and community banks are significant and \nthose differences pose important challenges for setting effective regulatory policy . This l eads me \nto ask a slightly different question  than Mr. Corrigan asked :  Are traditional banks , or \ncommunity banks , still important to the U.S. economy in 2017?   \nI answered this questi on affirmatively at the beginning of my remarks.   Indeed, \ntraditional banks are essential to thousands of communities across the country . In contrast to the \n\n7 \n large st banks, community banks still rely primarily on relationship lending, with a focus on \nfundin g local loans with core deposits . Their heterogeneous customer base and credit decisions \ninclude not only quantitative but qualitative aspects including judgments about the repayment \nability of their Main Street customers. These bankers serve on the boards  of local schools, \nhospitals  and other civic organizations, providing a key source of leadership in the community . \nThey serve their communit ies and are part of their communit ies.  \nBut do they matter to the U.S. economy as a whole?  Can o nline banking and scale satisfy \nthe credit needs on Main Street s and in rural areas ?  I am reminded that a lthough we often refer \nto “the U.S. economy ” in aggregate , as though it were a single  monolithic  entity , there are in fact \nthousands of micro -economie s that taken together make up the $19 trillion U.S. economy . In \nthese micro -economies, community banks are a critical source of financing for small businesses, \nincluding startups . While community banks account for just 13 percent of industry assets, they \nare responsible for some  40 percent of bank lending to small businesses . In turn, small \nbusinesses with less than 500 employees account for about 50 percent of U.S. private \nemployment .2 Moreover, recent research shows that small startups with 20  to 499 empl oyees \nplay a large role in net job creation that continues for up to five years after their formation.3  \nThis evidence indicates  community banks are still extremely important to our economy, \nalthough, their competitive position is under stress . Market forces of technology and innovation  \nare everywhere  and c ommunity banks will need to b e responsive to customer demand  for new \nservices and methods of banking . But these are not the forces that particularly concern me . The \nrisk I see stems from a misal igned regulatory environment that poses a threat in my view to the \n                                                 \n2 “United States Small Business Profile, 2016,” U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy.  \n3 See Robert Jay Dilger, “Small Business Administration and Job Creation,” Congressional Research Service, \nFebruary 8, 2017.  \n\n8 \n diversity of the U.S. banking system and healthy competition  that has long served the country \nwell.  \n \nPolicy Implications  \nToday , the nation stands at a crossroads of policy choices . As policymakers consider \nregulatory  reform , the special role of banks in our economy  and particularly the role of \ncommunity bank s, must factor into their decisions .  \nWe witnessed the tremendous cost of a financial crisis . The regulatory response that \nfollowed  was well  intended and even justified in its aims to end TBTF and protect consumers.  \nHowever,  while the aim was specific to the large st banks, the regulatory net has ensnared \nthousands of community banks . Regulators have applied supervisory approaches and protections \nthat often fail to take into account the incentives  and risk profile associated with relationship \nlending models  of community banks .  \nFor example, international capital standards , which formed the basis to reduce leverage in  \nthe biggest banks , layer on unnecessary reporting requirements and complexity for banks that \nalready held high levels of capital . Appraisal standards aimed to ensure independent valuations \nsupport new loans create  challenges for thousands of smaller banks that are portfolio  lenders . \nThese small institutions, often located in more rural markets, struggle  to find  knowledgeable \nappraisers with sufficient  comparable propert y sales to comply with the rules, and i n some cases, \nconclude that qualified borrowers ’ credit needs can’t be met .  \nFinally, rules aim ed at  protect ing consumers and other customers from unfair and \ndeceptive practices are important .  However, l ong-term relationship lending also aligns the \nincentives that protect community bank customers . Unfortunately, the compliance burden for \n\n9 \n community banks introduces costly processes along with fear and confusion as  they struggle to \napply  narrow  legal interpretations and opaque statistical models to the fair credit needs of their \nborrowers .  \nUltimately , communities suffer when access to credit is unnecessarily limited , and so \ndoes the larger economy .  Rules that aim to address the business models and incentives of the \nlargest banks may unintentionally put t he diversity of the banking system at risk , and the lack of \nnew bank  charter s over the past decade suggest s the barriers to entry may be high.   \n \nConclusion  \nThe regulatory remedy for today’s banking system will not be easily prescribed . But it \nwill need to recognize that the institutions we  collectively refer to as  “commercial banks” have \ndrifted apart over the past 35 years . At one end of the spectrum are banks that engage in global \nfinancing with systemic implications for failure and impact to the broader economy . At the other \nend are bank s that engage in traditional lend ing and deposit -taking , whose impact on small \nbusiness and small communities translates to real economic outcomes . \nToday, t he federal safety net supports both models and it is sagging , stretched by ever -\nlarger and more complex firms with significant nonbanking activities . Banking r egulation must \ndo its best to offset the very real exposures for taxpayers and the risk to economic and financial \nstability . Nurturing incentives that reward success and punish failure are key . Aligning regulation \nthat effectively addresses risk at both ends of this spectrum will require that regulators either \nclose the gap between their differences or embrace the two models and attempt to apply very \ndifferent supervisory frameworks  and approach es.  \n\n10 \n Market forces will continue to reshape the industry as they have for the past 35 years and \nlonger . And community bankers are no strangers to those market forces or a challenging \noperating environment . But the banking industry has evolved in very diffe rent ways and rules \nthat inhibit market forces without offsetting gain warrant scrutiny .  \nAs a highly concentrated banking system takes hold  in the U.S. , the issue of today’s \nbanking landscape poses a slightly different but important question about the abi lity of regulation \nto differentiate its aim . It will matter to thousands of communities served by you in the years \nahead , and by extension to the U.S. economy."

George  \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer  \nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 28 , 201 7 \nStanford Institute for Economic Policy Research  \nStanford, Calif.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe views expressed by the author are her own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, its governors, officers or representatives.  \n  \n\n1 \n Thank you . It is a pleasure to join you today , and  I am especially delighted that  Mylan \nGray , deputy chair of the Associated Students of Stanford University , is here this evening . Mylan \nis a Kansas Citian and an alum of the Kansas City Fed’s Student Board of Directors  program . \nFor the past two summe rs he has worked at the Bank as a “camp counselor ” at our Summer at \nthe Fed student program . That program introduces young students to banking, the economy and \npersonal finance . Last year, Mylan was the progr am’s activities director . \nThe mission of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research  is an important one . \nEconomic analysis and policy research  offers a critical foundation for policy deliberations . As a \nparticipant on the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) , our decision \nmaking and policy judgments  depend heavi ly on quality analysis to set a long -run course for \nmonetary policy , particularly when uncertainty dominates the landscape .  \nIn my remarks this evening , I’ll offer my view on the U.S. economy and  will talk a bit \nabout some of the challenges we have faced in the post -crisis environment . I’ll also  share my \nthoughts on what I believe to be the most appropriate action for policy moving forward . As \nalways, the views I express here are my own and are no t necessarily shared by others on the \nFOMC.  \n \nThe U.S. Economic Outlook  \nThis month (Feb . 2017) marks the 92nd consecutive month of the economic expansion  in \nthe United States , which is the third -longest U.S. expansion on record going back to about 1850. \nSince the end of the financial crisis, the economy has grown annually by about 2 percent each \nyear. Unemployment has declined and labor markets appear to have only m odest, if any, \nremaining slack. Inflation has been running at rates consistent with price stability and near the \n\n2 \n FOMC’s longer -run goal of 2  percent . Of course, there are always some areas of concern \nin the economy, but as a whole , things look fairly positive.  \n Optimism has increased during the past few months, as measured in both business and \nconsumer surveys. While consumer spending is expected to continue  at a healthy pace , this rise \nin confidence may not  automatically lead to even stronger consumer spending. The evidence \nsuggests that consumer confidence is not always a useful predictor of future consumption \ngrowth, especially once other factors such as interest rates or incom e growth are taken into \naccount. Still, household balance sheets are in much better  shape compared to the years \nimmediately following the  financial crisis and the labor market has been performing well, so the \noutlook remains positive for consumer spending.  \nLooking at labor markets, we’re essentially at or near full employment. The \nunemployment rate now sits at 4.8 p ercent, just below  what I view as its longer -run value of \nabout 5 percent. Labor force participation, which had been trending downwards for most of the \nexpansion, has leveled off and even slightly increased  over the past year. This recent rise appears \nto be due to a decline in labor force exits rather than an increase in labor force entry. In other \nwords, individuals are not more likely to return to the labor force right now, but workers are \nstaying on the job a bit longer. These factors suggest that there is not a lot of labor force slack, \neither among the officially unemployed or those out of the labor force who might rejoin.  \nOf course , there are numerous indicators on the labor market, so trying to judge the \namount of slack is not a straightforward task . One approach we use at the Kansas City Fed is a \nLabor Market Conditions Index, which was developed by my staff . It summarizes a wide array \nof labor market data into two succinct statistics :  the level of labor market activity and the \nmomentum of that activity . The most recent reading for January showed a level of activity that \n\n3 \n was above the long-term average, and a momentum indicator that was the highe st level since the \nseries began in 1992 .  \nAnother important indicator of slack in the labor market is wage growth, which has been \nquite moderate since the financial crisis, though has increased over the past year . Despite the \nimprovement in overall wage growth, there are differences across sectors. Recent re search by my \nstaff shows that the increase in wag es has been driven by only a few industry segments  – namely, \nthe construction, manufacturing and wholesale sectors. Growth in hours worked in these sectors \nhas been moderating, even as wages rise, perhaps suggesting firms are having an increasingly \ndifficu lt time attracting new workers. On the other hand, wage growth has shown few signs of \nacceleration in many of the service  sectors , although growth in hours worked has been steadily \nincreasing . This suggests there may have been a modest amount of slack in some service  sectors, \nbut as economic growth continues , workers will  likely  become increasingly scarce. This “bottom \nup” approach to evaluating the labor market suggests further  wage pressure is likely to follow \nacross a broader range of industries.  \nAs labor markets continue to improve and economic activity expand s, we could see a bit \nmore  inflationary pressure. Currently the FOMC’s preferred measure of inflation , the personal \nconsumption expenditures (PCE)  price index,  has increased by 1. 6 percent over the last 12 \nmonths. This measure has risen notably, compared to about 0.6 percent a year ago, as the effe cts \nof lower oil prices  have waned . Looking past the se oil price  effect s, the core me asure of inflation \nis up 1.7  percent  over the past year.   \nOther measures of inflation show similar trends. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is up \n2.5 percent  over the past year, the Dallas Fed’s trimmed -mean PCE inflation rate over the past \n\n4 \n year is up 1.9  percent  and the Cleveland Fed’s weighted median CPI is up 2.5  percent . All these \nmeasures  point in the same direction:  Inflation remains low , but is rising .  \n \nThe Role of Monetary Policy R ules  \nThe current state of the economy stand s in sharp contrast to earlier phases of  the \nrecovery . Follow ing the crisis, the unemployment rate was persistently  above its longer -run \nnormal level and inflation  below the FOMC’s 2 percent  longer -run goal . At the risk of \noversimplify ing, central banks generally respond with mo netary accommodation to support \neconomic activity and achieve their mandated objectives  in these conditions . That is, the \nstandard approach is to lower interest rates .  \nWhile the policy prescription in such  circumstances is generally straightforward, a few \ncomplications come into play. The first is that monetary policy operates with lags, which is a \npoint highlighted in the FOMC’s annual “Statement on Longer -Run Goals and Monetary Policy \nStrategy .” The timing and extent of a ny lags are imprecisely measured and can vary over time.  \nImportantly, these lags require monetary policy to act in a forward -looking manner. That is, \npolicymakers cannot wait to take action until they see  full employment and inflation at 2 percent . \nPolicy needs to be adjusted in advance.  Second, following the crisis, policymakers have become \nfar more attuned to the importance of fostering financial stability . While the relationship between \nmonetary policy and financial stability is not entirely clear, event s and research strongly suggest \nthat risk -taking often increases in low -rate environments . Indeed , the motivation for \nunconventional policies such as large -scale  asset purchases was aimed at provid ing additional \nstimulus at the zero lower bound by encouraging risk-taking , creating wealth effects , and \nboost ing asset prices . And third, policy needs to be set with a  sense of the risks surrounding the \n\n5 \n economic outlook . Foreign developments or financial  market volatility are examples of issues \nthat might cause policymakers to temporarily adjust course . Judging the scope and impact  of \nsuch risks is always  challenging , but this caution carries certain costs . Postponing rate \nadjustments is not unreasonable in the face of near-term risk s, but can keep policy stuck in place. \nThe result ing delay can leave a lasting imprint on the stance of monetary policy , especially  if \nadjustments are not made after the risk pass es. \nPolicymakers must deal w ith such complications . Among the tools available to us are \nmonetary policy rules, commonly known a s Taylor rules . These rules  provide guidelines for how \nto calibrate interest rates  under most economic conditions . How the FOMC should use such rules \nhas been the focus of some recent public discussion. In fact, the FOMC does consult the \nguidance coming from monetary policy rules  at each of its meetings . Rules come in many \nflavors , depending on what variables are included , the weights attached to  the different variables , \nand the designated value of the longer -run level of the funds rate. All of these make choosing a \nsingle rule difficult, but that’s not to say that they are not immensely useful. They may offer \ndifferent advice, but when all the ad vice moves in a particular direction, that is usually an \nimportant signal to policymakers.  \nWhile a variety of rules exist, t he intuition behind them  is relatively straightforward . \nMost rules take into account how far inflation is from the FOMC’s price sta bility target , as well \nas how far the labor market is from full employment . The deviation from their longer -run levels  \nis accounted for in the resulting rate prescription . When both numbers are close to their longer -\nrun levels, the se rules often prescribe that the federal funds rate should be near or be moving \ntoward its longer -run level . Indeed, most monetary policy rules today are pointing in the same \ngeneral direction and suggest short -term interest rates should be moving higher.  Given these \n\n6 \n signals , it may be a bit surprising that the FOMC has only raised its policy rate target twice since \nthe end of the financial crisis.  \n \nThe Path to the Longer -Run  \nWhile these p olicy  rules are prescrib ing higher short -term interest rates , the FOMC has \ndetermined that the path for raising rates will be a gradual  one. Part of the reason for a gradual \napproach is risk management. Moving too quickly could potentially risk slowing economic \nactivity , which obviously would not be an objective of monetary policy given current growth and \ninflation rates . A more rapid increase in short -term rates also could pose risks to financial \nstability  after an extended period of near zero rates . \nWhile I support th is gradual approach , the current readings for inflation and \nunemployment rel ative to the FOMC’s mandate d objectives  argue for more than just one move \nper year , as has been the case over the previous two years . This pace has left the current stance of \npolicy more accommodative than advocated by most policy rules and the funds rate well below \nits longer -run level, a discrepancy I see as important to  remedy in order  to preserve longer -run \nprice stability  and sustainabl e growth . \nIn considering the path to more normal interest rate settings, some have questioned \nwhether monetary policy is truly stimulative given that unusually low rates have not generated \nthe same kind of growth or inflation experienced in the past . One explanation is that certain \nfeatures of the economy may have changed , and that these changes are reflected in a measure \nknown as  the natural rate of interest. For example, short -term interest rates adjusted for inflation  \n– that is, real rates – have been n egative for many  years . When real rates are low, but the \neconomy is not growing rapidly, the  implication is that the  natural rate of interest is quite low. \n\n7 \n Although not observable,  movements in the natural rate  are presumed to occur gradually, \nsuggest ing current low level s will persist and result in a lower  longer -run federal funds rate than \nin the past. The implication of a lower natural interest rate would mean that today’s monetary \npolicy settings , although low by historical standards , might not be as stimulative as policy rules \nsuggest.  \nWhat would cause the economy to change in such a way ? There are likely any number of \nreasons, but one that seems plausible is that productivity growth has not been as strong as it was \nin previous decade s. Slower productivity growth, which has been an ongoing issue for the \neconomy  for some time , means the supply side of the economy also is grow ing more slowly. As \na result, moderate economic growth may be sufficient to absorb slack  and could  even cause the  \neconomy to outrun its potential . In fact, we see this today in some measures of what is called the \noutput gap , which captures the difference between th e level of economic activity and what the \neconomy can produce at full employment . For example, the Feder al Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco produces a measure of the output gap  and natural rate . They show that 2 percent \ngrowth the past few years has actually been higher than the economy’s potential and in fact, the \namount of economic activity is currently above  its potential level. These circumstances often \nlead to price pressures and higher inflation.  \nPulling the pieces together, then, how should monetary policy respond in a setting with a \nlow natural rate of interest and s low productivity growth, but with the economy growing  faster \nthan its potential? Again, we can glean insight from Taylor rules, which still would prescribe a \nhigher federal funds rate in the near -term to ensure economic activity does not too far exceed its \npotential capacity, but that  rate might top out at a level  below what we have seen in the past. \nThat is, the longer -run level of the funds rate could be lower than in previous decades.  \n\n8 \n The case for a much lower natural rate of interest seems plausible to me, but it puts a \ngreat deal of weight on estimate s that are subject to considerable uncertainty . History has shown \nthat deviating from long -run variables can increase risk to desired economic outcomes . My own \nview is that policy must still adjust from its current settings  in order to  “promote effectively the \ngoals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long -term interest rates” as \nspecified by the Federal Reserve Act . So while I see a gradual approach to raising rates as \nappropriate, I see more than one move per year , as h as been the case,  as needed to achieve the \nFOMC’s objectives .  \n \nConclusion  \nEconomic expansion over the past seven years has brought the labor market and inflation \nto levels consistent with the FOMC’s longer -run objectives . In this environment, p olicy rules  \npoint to higher rates, and there is reason to believe they are fairly signaling . To be sure, t he \noutlook for the economy does not call for tight policy by any means, but a gradual and deliberate \nmove to more normal rates is necessary  to limit the risk of creating imbalances and financial \nstability risks that could surface in undesirable ways."
