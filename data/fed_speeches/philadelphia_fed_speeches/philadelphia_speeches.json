            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the 8th Annual Fintech Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nNow, I’m not here to distract at all from today’s proceedings. But I still must preface my remarks with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nBut disclaimer notwithstanding, I believe I can speak for everyone in thanking our panelists and speakers without whom this conference would not be able to work, and also the organizing partners without whom this year’s conference would not be able to happen.\n\nAnd I must single-out for thanks Julapa Jagtiani, who truly is the visionary behind this entire endeavor.\n\nBack when Julapa proposed a conference focused on the growing fintech space, I gave it the green light not just because it was a timely subject but also because I thought it offered an opportunity for the Philly Fed to showcase the field’s thought leadership. Today we find ourselves at the eighth edition of what is, in my view, among the most influential global fintech conferences.\n\nJulapa was really on to something. Moreover, she has made this convening what it is today. So, Julapa, thank you and congratulations!\n\nBut of course, I must give my biggest thanks to all of you with us for this conference, whether you are among the 200 here in person or the more than 1,400 watching online.\n\nI can speak of this conference’s growth — both in attendance and in prominence — through the words of English poet William Blake who penned the line, “What is now proved was once only imagined.”\n\nAnd looking back at the seven previous conferences, I can also use Blake’s words to sum up another vital aspect of this event: “Without Contraries is no progression.”\n\nOr, maybe in more modern parlance, when I served as a White House Fellow, my former boss, the late FBI Director William Sessions, would say, “No friction, no traction.\"\n\nJulapa and her team have always brought together speakers and panelists who don’t always complement each other, in which ever way you wish to use the word, “complement.” There have been very spirited and frank conversations about the core issues surrounding the fintech space and its potential broader economic prospects.\n\nThis conference has become a platform where experience is valued, with panelists and speakers bringing ever-increasing levels of expertise built on years of research and practice to the stage. Moreover, these are ongoing and evolving discussions. That is, in and of itself, a good thing. The fintech space, for all its dynamism and complexity, is always evolving and if we looked at a topic — any topic — at just a single conference and then moved on, we’d be missing so much.\n\nConsider the focus of the very first conference in 2017: “Fintech: The Impact on Consumers, Banking, and Regulatory Policy.” The sessions in that first conference included, “Fintech Lending and Roles of Alternative Information” and “Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.” The keynote address topic was, “Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Cryptocurrencies.”\n\nThese have all remained core topics covered at this conference year over year. They remain on the docket today because they not only continue to impact our financial and economic landscape but they are also doing so in new and ever-changing ways.\n\nToday’s conference features an updated and expanded vocabulary, with terms such as “tokenization” and “banking-as-a-service.” And I trust that they will remain in bold print on the agendas of future conferences for the same reason.\n\nWithin these conferences we have had some hearty discussions that lean, sometimes slightly and sometimes more overtly, into, well, maybe we’ll call them “spirited discussions.” But that is also good.\n\nWe should be engaging in these kinds of discussions regularly and deeply, presenting new evidence and experiences to refine these arguments and improve the technologies themselves.\n\nAnd no doubt, without these discussions we’d be missing the nuance — and the contraries and frictions — that accompany any advancements. It is perhaps an overused term, but fintech remains a “disrupter” to traditional banking and financial models even as they are adopted by or, at least, partnered with traditional banks and nonbank financial institutions. But as this conference has proven, being called a disrupter doesn’t have to be pejorative.\n\nTake instant payment systems, for example. According to an October 2023 survey conducted by McKinsey, more than 90 percent of respondents reported having used a digital payment platform in the previous year.1 In 2021, that number was 82 percent, which was 10 points higher than it was five years prior2 — the year before the inaugural Fintech Conference.\n\nBut it is not necessarily bank-designed-and-operated apps that are handling many of these digital payment transactions. It is many times falling to a banking-as-a-service platform run by a nonbank intermediary, who is conducting the actual movement of money from one account to another. As a quick aside, the leaders of several of these instant payment companies are among the speakers at this conference. And let’s not forget that when I took to this podium a year ago, I lauded the Federal Reserve’s own foray into the instant payments space through the launch of FedNow.\n\nBut let’s assume that if we walked out onto Independence Mall and asked a random passerby if they use a “banking-as-a-service” app, we’d likely get a very quizzical look.\n\nNow, if we instead mentioned the name of a specific payment service or loan provider that exists as an app on their phone instead of a brick-and-mortar building, we’d likely get a more knowing response.\n\nIf I could make a generalized assumption, it would be this: Being able to directly buy groceries or even secure a car loan through their phone is something that individual would consider a net positive. Fintech has increased the speed and efficiency of the financial system as it pertains to them.\n\nBy the way, I’d be interested if anyone here wishes to undertake this particular social experiment during one of the break periods.\n\nSo, what does all this have to do with why we are here? Because this conference has established itself at the forefront of discussions on topics that may have once been considered arcane but have since become ubiquitous. And here we’re not just talking about the changes in technologies but we’re also being forced to contend with the need to change the regulatory environment, as well.\n\nFor all of us, the task is to make sure we understand the full discussion. That’s why it is vital that we invite all views into these conversations, so we can assure ourselves of actual progress that works for those of us in this room and also for consumers.\n\nSo, if I may step into the role of one of Blake’s “contraries” for a moment, I recently read the 2019 book, The Great Reversal, by economist and NYU Professor Thomas Philippon.\n\nIn one chapter, he noted something he found peculiar: According to his data, by 2010, the share of U.S. Gross Domestic Product claimed by financial intermediaries reached roughly 8 percent. In 1880, it was 2 percent, and while it had ebbed and flowed over the years, it never exceeded 6 percent until the 1980s and kept growing.3 Certainly, that makes sense as the number of financial products and services being offered has grown exponentially.\n\nYet, according to Philippon, the unit cost of financial intermediation — or the cost of providing a service to a consumer — has remained roughly constant at around 2 percent. And that goes all the way back to the start of his data in the 1880s. This, as he states, creates a puzzle — if we have so much more invested in the intermediary systems that enhance the efficiency and speed of our financial system, why has the cost at the consumer’s end remained steady? Philippon, in subsequent research, brought in some later data to update this figure, finding that the cost had decreased slightly between 2010 and 2015.4 So, we have grounds for optimism, but overall costs have yet to fall significantly below that stubborn 2 percent.\n\nAs the amount of choice before consumers has grown, and as financial technologies have removed so many barriers to entry and movement, why hasn’t this cost decreased by more? Obviously, the financial system in 2024 is not working at the same level of operational efficiency as it was in 1924 — it’s working at far greater magnitudes of efficiency.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the challenge I shall leave with you all here: To use this conference not merely as a way for us, in Blake’s words, to prove that which had previously only been imagined, but to prove it in a way that provides both an operational benefit to the financial system and a tangible benefit to the end-use consumers beyond convenience.\n\nDare I say, if that gets traction and makes progress, there would likely be a lot less friction and many fewer contraries.\n\nAnd it is in this sentiment that I am honored to turn the podium back over to Julapa, so she can introduce our first speaker. I thank you for allowing me these few minutes and I wish you all a productive and thought-provoking conference.",

            "content": "The following text is President Harker’s lecture delivered at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business on Friday, September 20, 2024. President Harker may make additional comments beyond what is reflected in his prepared remarks.\n\nThank you all for being here, it truly is a treat to be in the Big Easy.\n\nI must thank my old friend, and your current president, Mike Fitts, who helped set this event in motion. President Fitts and I go back a long way, when he was first Professor Fitts and then Dean Fitts at the University of Pennsylvania’s Carey School of Law and I was a professor and then dean of the Wharton School. His first year as president of Tulane overlapped with my last year as president of the University of Delaware.\n\nThere are two things I must do at the outset.\n\nFirst, I must say the following: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThat’s the standard Fed disclaimer. But I always boil it down to the following — when you’re recalling today’s discussion you can always say, “Pat said,” you cannot say “the Fed said.”\n\nAnd second, while we’re talking disclosure, I must admit that I’m not here in New Orleans only to speak with you today. My son and I already booked our trip to watch our Philadelphia Eagles take on the Saints at the Superdome. When I mentioned to President Fitts that I was coming down, he invited me to campus, and I readily accepted.\n\nSo, while I recognize I may be in rival territory, I am certainly comforted by all the green I see on campus. I also think Riptide and Swoop the Eagle would be good friends.\n\nSo don’t worry, I’ll be rooting for the Green Wave tomorrow against the Ragin’ Cajuns. And if anyone has a recommendation for a good place to watch the game, come see me after!\n\nNow, if you’ll allow, I have some prepared remarks, but then I do want to get out from behind this podium to get to your questions. I have titled this talk “It’s More Than Just Interest Rates.” And that’s on purpose.\n\nI want to hopefully break the views that some of you may hold of what the Federal Reserve is, what it does, and, importantly, what it can offer in terms of career opportunities.\n\nCertainly, if you are an economics major focusing on the minutiae of monetary policy and economic forecasting, there is a potential place for your talents in the Federal Reserve. The Fed is, after all, the largest employer of economists in the nation.\n\nBut, that said, while I have been president and chief executive officer of the Philly Fed for nearly a decade, I am not an economist by training. I hold bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in civil engineering. I actually received my master’s in economics because I needed to understand the economic underpinnings of a project I was working on about railroads.\n\nSo, take it from me, you don’t need to be a Ph.D. economist to make it at the Fed — you just need to be driven by a desire to make our economy healthier, stronger, and more inclusive.\n\nAs I hope to lay out, the Fed is diverse and dynamic — both in terms of our work and in our world views across the System. The Fed’s ability to build a more secure economic future that benefits all Americans requires attracting and retaining a diverse and dynamic set of individuals committed to service.\n\nWe work to improve the economies of our Districts and constituencies, and even more importantly, improve the lives of the people we serve. And there are plenty of career opportunities across the Federal Reserve for those interested in doing just that.\n\nI would add here that we are committed to also being more diverse in our makeup. At the Philly Fed, we take enormous pride in having not just one of the best thought leadership teams around, but also one that is diverse in its makeup of backgrounds, experiences, and world views. To us, academic excellence is critical, however, lived experience can help make sure we’re asking the right questions.\n\nBut perhaps I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Let’s take a step back to what the Federal Reserve is and why it was created. The Federal Reserve System is only roughly 111 years old. It was created in 1913 to provide centralized economic and financial leadership to a nation whose largely decentralized financial system had failed to protect the economy against financial shocks, panics, scams, and scandals.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., and 12 district banks — each with a specific geographic footprint, and each of which is an independently chartered institution. While in many areas these district banks work in partnership, each district bank also conducts its own research, oversees the operations of hundreds of banks, and undertakes projects across its own district.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed oversees the Third District, which includes central and eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. New Orleans is part of the Sixth District which is headquartered in Atlanta and covers much of the southern United States. There is a branch of the Atlanta Fed just a few miles down St. Charles Ave across from Lafayette Square.\n\nOver the past century plus, the Federal Reserve System has provided stability to financial markets, oversight to financial institutions, and confidence to the American people in both. This has required a pragmatic approach to our work. Yes, we live in a political world. But we do not, and cannot, allow our decisions to be made by politics.\n\nWe operate in accordance with the two explicit tasks, known as the “dual mandate,” which were handed to us by Congress: one, to ensure stable prices for the American people, and two, to ensure maximum employment.\n\nThat first pillar — stable prices — is easy to define. That’s inflation. That’s where the monetary policy tools available to us on the FOMC are our instruments, blunt instruments though they may be. Through the policy interest rate, as well as our own balance sheet of institutional assets, we can influence the push and pull of the economy to maintain price stability and meet our inflation target.\n\nIt’s an overly simplistic model but think for a moment of the economy as a bus. If we sense the bus is going too fast, that is, and the economy is at risk of overheating, the FOMC can increase the policy rate, figuratively tapping “the brakes” on the economy to get inflation under control by cooling consumers’ appetites and firms’ investment plans. If we sense that the bus is traveling too slowly, the FOMC can give the economy a little more “gas” by setting policy rates low to stimulate consumption and investment. And if we sense that we’re traveling at an appropriate speed and we just need to keep things, we can choose to do nothing.\n\nObviously, as with driving a bus, there are many subtleties to take into account. This is why we’ve remained so dependent on surveying all the available data and, importantly, taking a longer-look approach and not over- or under-reacting to one particular month or one particular dataset. We’ve had to watch the entire “road,” and we indeed had quite an “inflation bump” in the first quarter of this year. If we were to press too hard on either the gas or brakes, we could lose control of the bus. If we weren’t paying close attention to the road before us, we could hit a pothole, or worse.\n\nOver the past 30 months, I believe we’ve proven ourselves to have been pretty good drivers — and I’m from New Jersey so we think we know a thing or two about good driving! But please do not ask anyone from outside New Jersey about that.\n\nOK, so that covers one half of our mandate. Now, let’s get to the second: maximum employment. Here is where I believe the breadth of our efforts has an impact.\n\nSo, as you can see, the Federal Reserve is way more than just interest rates. You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in economics to consider a career at the Federal Reserve — just take me as an example!\n\nAs I noted, I’ve done this job for a little more than nine years now. Next year, I will hit the Fed’s mandatory retirement age and have to leave this post. But what a way to go — to know that the decisions I have had to make on the FOMC, and the work done by countless dedicated individuals at the Philadelphia Fed and across the Federal Reserve System, have left an indelible and, I hope, positive mark on our nation’s economic future.\n\nI hope my remarks have sparked an interest in the Federal Reserve as well as the personal decisions you will make regarding your own economic futures.\n\nNow, I think I’ve gone on long enough and given you a taste of life at the Fed. Now I want to hear what’s been on your minds, and I am eager to start this Q&A.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome once again to this first-ever conference sponsored by CREED, the Center for the REstoration of Economic Data here at the Philly Fed.\n\nI must begin by giving my thanks to the Philadelphia Fed’s very own Dan Moulton for the introduction, and to the conference organizers for their efforts in bringing us together and leadership in bringing the concept of CREED to fruition. CREED is the result of a collaboration between the Consumer Finance Institute and the Research Department, and as such is an excellent example of our Bank coming together across departments and disciplines to bring something new and exciting to life.\n\nTeams like CREED don’t come together without the support of departmental leadership. I thank Bob Hunt and Julia Cheney of the Consumer Finance Institute and Research Director Roc Armenter for their ongoing support of this tremendous and time-intensive effort.\n\nAnd at the outset I must recognize the Philadelphia Department of Records and City Archives as well as the Athenaeum of Philadelphia whose partnership in this long-term endeavor has not only been significant but also vital.\n\nNow, if you’ve attended a conference here at the Philadelphia Fed, you know there’s one important piece of business we need to take care of before we get to the heart of any matter — the Fed disclaimer! The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nSo, with that out of the way, let’s get into it.\n\nOurs is a world in which we are figuratively swimming in data and, if we still lived in a paper society, we could quite possibly literally swim in it, too!\n\nMoreover, we are continually creating new data. In this, we’re not merely adding new numbers or interpretation to long-established data sets. Like a baseball general manager using so-called “sabermetrics,” in some cases, we’re giving researchers the data to create entirely new means of statistical analyses.\n\nBut none of that devalues existing data.\n\nIn fact, in this data-driven present, I would argue that historical data — whether from decades or centuries ago — is more valuable to us today than ever. As we saw recently with the introduction of Negro League statistics1 to the official Major League Baseball record books, historical data that might have been written off as lost or buried in the pages of time can be brought back to life to better inform how we regard our past. Much of this data was culled through the painstaking, archival work of poring through old newspaper articles, box scores, and scoresheets.\n\nAnd because of this work, when someone searches for career batting average leaders, for example, they will find Negro League great Josh Gibson atop that list and no longer Ty Cobb.\n\nThis effort, which has produced a fuller and clearer picture of the history of our national pastime, set the bar for what the effort being undertaken by our CREED team can be in other fields. It is all about finding the data that had largely been left behind.\n\nYes, it is easy to say that we are in “unprecedented times.” And, true, this economy has certainly invented some pitches some of us had never before seen cross the plate. But, almost invariably, someone has faced a similar pitch before. And when we allow ourselves to go back to when those pitches were invented, we can learn how best to take our swings today.\n\nIn this sense, our past can be seen very much as prologue to both our current conditions and our future prospects.\n\nAnd there’s no sense in gatekeeping this data here at the Philly Fed. What we aim to do through CREED is to make this history available to everyone. To achieve this goal, we’re doing the hands-on work of locating and scanning archival records and using state-of-the-art tools and techniques to digitize and structure it so that others — from economists to social scientists, from journalists to students, from historians to the history-curious — can have it at their fingertips.\n\nWe’re taking unstructured, analog data and converting it into useful, accessible, and high-quality data.\n\nNow, I don’t need to preach to you of all audiences about the importance of data quality, particularly regarding a publicly offered dataset. While many data digitization tools are on the leading edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the advanced quality of these tools do not guarantee data quality. The second goal that CREED hopes to achieve is to improve on these tools and methods, and again, make this knowledge available to the public.\n\nAs Dan and others will lay out in their presentations, many of today’s tools are still works in progress in some respects. But as we continue to apply them to more varied projects, we can help refine the tools themselves and also help researchers understand how best to deploy them.\n\nSimply put, the promise of CREED is using the technology of today to unlock the past — an oftentimes forgotten past. And, as I’ll describe in a moment, it is critical that we unlock the past to help us answer the question, “How did we get here?”\n\nIn answering this question, there is one subject area, in particular, where the CREED initiative is already proving itself as an invaluable research tool: housing.\n\nIn his own groundbreaking research, Larry Santucci and his research team combed through and digitized thousands of Philadelphia housing deeds, creating a map tracing the growth and spread of racial covenants that, a century ago, created two separate Philadelphias within the city’s singular footprint. The racial covenants map on its own is a tremendous historical tool — but it is also an invaluable tool for policymakers today.\n\nAlso here at the Philly Fed, Jeffrey Lin, Jeff Brinkman, and Kyle Mangum are currently working on research that is finding that proposed highway segments have a permanent negative impact on central city neighborhoods. Let me say that again — proposed. Some were never built yet have had long-term detrimental effects. I do look forward to their final paper.\n\nAllow me to pause here to make two short declarative statements. First, small decisions can have big impacts. Second, these impacts can persist for a long time, even if the initial choices are made irrelevant. To quote William Faulkner, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”\n\nThe research I have just noted suggests evidence for these two statements.\n\nPhiladelphia today remains the poorest large city in America as well as among the nation’s most racially segregated. These rankings didn’t happen by mere chance. Long ago, policymakers, developers, realtors, and homeowners made conscious decisions about where and whether certain individuals could live in certain parts of this city. Looking at the racial covenants map, which shows us Philadelphia’s myriad housing and social challenges over time, you can't help but wonder how much these decisions shaped the city we live in today.\n\nBut more broadly, the work being undertaken by CREED can help provide historical context that current data sets simply cannot. Again, we can look at the housing market to see the promise of bringing old data to light.\n\nThere is no doubt that home prices and affordability — especially within urban areas — is a distinct challenge. I hear it directly from my contacts throughout the Third District. Young families are increasingly priced out of the neighborhoods in which they wish to live and raise their families. More growing families, perhaps already in their starter home, are incapable of affording their next home, even with the increase in their current home’s market value. Investors purchasing properties can increase rents faster than current residents can absorb.\n\nWe can easily look back — or even think back — across the past 20 years to how prices have risen and fallen and risen again. But that’s just a snapshot of a housing market ebbing and flowing.\n\nAllison Shertzer, now at the Philly Fed, and her colleagues utilized digitized newspaper real estate sections from 30 major markets from 2006, and going in some cases all the way back to 1890, to trace housing prices through time and across multiple generations. The picture that this newly constructed, historical data paints is one in which, yes, current home prices and rents are at all-time highs, but these data are filling in previously blank spots in economic history.\n\nI know Allison will be presenting at this conference, so I don’t want to steal her thunder. But suffice it to say her work in bringing these data back from the great beyond is going to arm researchers — not just her and her colleagues, but those across the country — with new and invaluable inputs to better understand housing markets. And it is going to help put current challenges into a clearer perspective.\n\nWhen Major League Baseball announced the inclusion of Negro League stats into the official record book — rewriting the history of our national pastime to be more inclusive and more complete — MLB’s historian, John Thorne, said, “I believe that the past is a living, breathing thing that informs every present moment.”2\n\nAnd it is in this sentiment where I believe the CREED effort will likewise shine.\n\nNow, I’m not going to say that CREED is the solution to the problems facing our modern economy. But I will say that the data that CREED is producing for the public sphere is certainly data that policymakers and others can use to better inform our present moment.\n\nAnd, it is my hope that, in some cases, it will be the basis upon which broad-based solutions to those problems may be crafted.\n\nWith that all said, I thank you for spending your day here at the Philadelphia Fed for this inaugural conference. And I look forward to hearing and reading about all the ways that the data being unlocked today will benefit our common tomorrow.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to once again join the Global Interdependence Center.\n\nIt is also my pleasure to welcome Central Bank of Ireland Governor Gabriel Makhlouf to the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nAnd in doing so, I must acknowledge the figure who stands central in the histories of the central banks in both of our respective countries — the economist Henry Parker Willis. Parker Willis was one of the main architects of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, and subsequently served as both the first secretary of the Federal Reserve Board as well as the Federal Reserve System’s director of research from 1918 to 1922. And, in 1926, as the then four-year-old Irish Free State grappled with the question of how to set up its own independent currency system, it enlisted Henry Parker Willis to lead this effort. His experiences and expertise directly influenced the Irish Currency Act of 1927.\n\nOver the past century, Ireland and the United States have enjoyed a strong, friendly, and beneficial relationship. And our history surely predates Irish independence to the ancestors of today’s millions of proud Irish Americans. As an individual, I’m proud of this history, but as a central banker, I take pride in knowing that this history extends to our financial underpinnings, as well!\n\nNow, before I get to the topics at hand, and to our moderated discussion, allow me to do away with a bit of official business by noting that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). And with that disclosure now out of the way, let’s get into this afternoon’s program and I’ll begin with my overview of current economic conditions.\n\nAllow me to open with four brief statements. First, high inflation remains not only a leading concern of many Americans, but certainly also one of mine and my colleagues’.\n\nSecond, the overall underpinnings of the American economy have proven nothing less than resilient, time and time again, despite the high rates leaning against aggregate demand for more than a year now.\n\nThird, monetary policy overall remains positioned in restrictive territory to bring inflation back to its 2 percent target, while minimizing broader economic risks.\n\nAnd fourth, we are still surrounded by an air soaked with uncertainty. There are a host of risks and known unknowns, but what I would like to emphasize is that the data haven’t, so far, resolved those. Indeed, data have been what I would describe as “choppy.” Not that this is unheard of. As the economy becomes more balanced, the chances of a miss on the upside or downside are more evenly distributed.\n\nBut the point stands, the data have not quite dissipated this uncertainty as I would have hoped they would. Well, then, maybe I should add a fifth — more data is essential.\n\nWith regard to inflation, as we all saw, the promising disinflation in the second half of 2023 unceremoniously halted through the first quarter of 2024. I had expected bumps in the road, but the Q1 2024 “bump” threatened to become a hill to climb. Yet, while the lack of progress toward the inflation target was concerning, inflation did not re-ignite.\n\nAnd while I remain very attentive to inflation risks, the latest inflation data have been quite promising that progress on disinflation has resumed. But “promising” falls short of the confidence I want to have, before cutting rates, that inflation is on a sustainable path back to target.\n\nInflation has a range of impacts throughout the economy, but its greatest impact is on low- and moderate-income families — those who have already been pinching their pennies over the past two years and aren’t sure how much more they can pinch. The situation has been made much worse as inflation hit hard the basic necessities: shelter, food, transportation.\n\nFortunately, we have seen quite a bit of improvement in many categories. Food prices have been essentially flat for several months now. Gas prices came down sharply in 2023. Vehicles, new and used, are cheaper now than a year ago. Unfortunately, the long-term stubbornness of shelter inflation, especially, remains a concern along with the continually high rate of inflation in the services sector, notably auto insurance and repairs — echoes of the past runups in vehicle prices, most likely.\n\nLast week’s CPI inflation release for May was very welcome, and the kind of price data I want to see more of. But I would add the caveat that our inflation target is the PCE price index, not the CPI, the May reading of which is not due for another 11 days. If the higher inflation in the first quarter was a bump in the road, I want to make sure that the lower inflation we are seeing so far in the second quarter is not a pothole.\n\nI remain focused on seeing inflation return to a clear path toward our target rate of 2 percent annually.\n\nOverall, there is much in the American economy that allows me to remain optimistic. Unemployment remains low, job creation appears robust, and labor market participation is within range of its historic levels. So, the labor market remains healthy, while supply and demand are coming into better balance, as shown by the average number of job openings to job seekers, as well as other measures of labor market tightness, like quits and job-to-job transitions, both of which are gently normalizing. Gross domestic product, while leveling off in the first quarter from the close of 2023, continues to grow. We have seen some moderation in consumer spending as of late, and I am keeping a close eye on household finances.\n\nAll said, as recent Fed survey data show, overall measurements of economic well-being among American households remained essentially unchanged from 2022. The percentage of respondents saying they were “doing at least okay financially” in 2023 was roughly where it was the prior year, for example. And economic resilience as measured by respondents’ ability to afford an emergency $400 expense similarly remained unchanged.1\n\nYet inflation continued to eat away at the sense of true economic well-being. More respondents said their expenses increased than said their incomes increased. And, I should add, these results are in line with what I hear as I speak with residents and contacts across the Third District. This is a strong convergence of soft data.\n\nSo, to me the key is wrestling inflation back down to target. And, in this, progress has been uneven. Inflation is way down from where it was a year ago, but with the high inflation readings between January and March factored in, progress in recent months has been modest.\n\nI believe that the current policy interest rate, which has been held steady for nearly 11 months, will continue to serve us well for a bit longer, holding us in restrictive territory to bring inflation back to target and mitigate upside risks.\n\nOver the ensuing months, I will continue to closely monitor the data — both hard and soft — on inflation, labor markets, and economic activity. And I will be asking whether it is, or is not, the right time to decrease the policy interest rate.\n\nWhen that time will be, exactly, I don’t yet know. I have a forecast for inflation, employment, and economic activity: slowing but above trend growth, a modest rise in the unemployment rate, and a long glide back to target for inflation.\n\nAnd if all of it happens to be as forecasted, I think one rate cut would be appropriate by year’s end — as well as a medal for myself for best economic forecaster ever. Because any forecast remains just that: a forecast. It is not a lock-down commitment.\n\nMy commitment is to remain data dependent because this is how we get through the uncertainty and make sure inflation returns to target, sustainably.\n\nIndeed, I see two cuts, or none, for this year as quite possible if the data break one way or another. So, again, we will remain data dependent.\n\nThis is a time when the independence of the Federal Reserve System — and beyond to that of other central banks — will be of utmost importance. This is a fraught time in our nation and world, which makes it all the more vital that we, as central bankers, remain not nonpartisan but apolitical. We at the Fed operate under our dual mandate to ensure price stability and maximum employment for the American people. That is our mandate, given by the U.S. Congress, and it is our goal.\n\nTo achieve this, we must make decisions by looking at all the data, not just a narrow set, and by asking and answering the right questions.\n\nAnd that statement brings me to my final thoughts to share with you. How do we ensure we’re asking the right questions to begin with? I can say with great pride that the research team here at the Philadelphia Fed is filled with some of the brightest economic minds available. And I know that goes the same for the team in Washington and at our sister banks across the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhenever I speak to students studying economics, I’m quick to note that the Federal Reserve System is the largest employer of economists in the nation. I want these future economists to consider us as a potential career choice. I’m not just a central banker; I’m a recruiter!\n\nRecently, I’ve been pleased to see that the makeup of these student audiences has become somewhat more diverse over time. To me, this next generation of economists isn’t just important because they are the ones who will sit at the desks of those who have gone on to retirement or other aspects of the field. What’s more important are the perspectives they will bring into these future positions. And we need voices that are not going to be afraid to challenge us into looking at old numbers with new eyes.\n\nTo foster this, the Philadelphia Fed has partnered with the National Association for Business Economics, or NABE, in an effort to bring more historically underrepresented individuals into the field of economics. But to be sure, we are not the only ones who have recognized the vital need for diversity not just in economic thinking, but in economic thinkers.\n\nThe simple reality is that the underrepresentation of women and minority students at the college and university level ultimately leads to an underrepresentation at the professional level.\n\nNearly a decade ago, in 2016, an article in the American Economic Association’s Journal of Economic Perspectives noted that the lack of diversity within the field of economics “hampers the discipline, constraining the range of issues addressed and limiting our collective ability to understand familiar issues from new and innovative perspectives.”2\n\nThat concern was underscored by research released by the New York Fed in 2017.3 That research measured student diversity in economics programs through the attainment of bachelor’s degrees at hundreds of colleges and universities across the United States. It was a project that captured the annual makeup of classes from 2011 through 2015 — a yearly average of nearly 35,000 economics students. Overwhelmingly, the data showed that the presence of women and underrepresented minorities lagged well behind that of white males.\n\nNow, certainly, there are many reasons why students may not choose to study economics. Perhaps the discipline’s moniker as the “dismal science” may hamper recruitment. But as we here know, economics is far more than just “guns and butter,” being able to define “opportunity cost” and “mutual exclusivity,” or understanding, let alone grasping, the minutiae of monetary policy.\n\nSo much of our world, and nearly every decision made by individuals and governments, whether they recognize it or not, is an economic decision at its heart — everything from the goods they purchase, to the jobs they take, to whether or not to go to school to study economics. And homogeneity in the economic discipline prevents us from being able to more fully investigate those decisions to more fully understand choices and trade-offs, and to move economics forward in a more meaningful way that captures the nuances of rapidly changing economies and societies.\n\nEven just one year ago, researchers in a London School of Economics blog post wrote: “Diversity among economists is crucial for policymaking as it enables the inclusion of a wide range of perspectives and experiences, leading to more informed and effective decision-making.”4\n\nThis goes far beyond an ability to understand hard data. We can take all the classes we want and become proficient in collecting hard data and making calculations that seek to understand decisions and influence policy. But hard data can only take a researcher so far. Equally important is the soft data — and there is no soft data that can be more important than a lived experience.\n\nOr, as the Harvard Business Review succinctly asked in 2022: “Without many economists from less socioeconomically advantaged backgrounds, what kinds of perspectives, questions, and answers are we missing?”5\n\nFor us here at the Philadelphia Fed, we know that increasing the diversity of those studying and practicing economics isn’t just good for ensuring that our workplace is more reflective of the world outside our walls; it is crucial to ensuring that the work we produce is more reflective, and therefore better, as well. It is vital, as well, to the reputation of that work.\n\nIn the words of that most preeminent of Philadelphians, Benjamin Franklin, “Glass, China, and Reputation, are easily cracked, and never well mended.”\n\nSo, my hope is for everyone here today to likewise commit to ensuring that the reputation of the economics discipline does not crack. I ask you to commit to ensuring economics remains relevant in the lives of those we aim to support through our work. I encourage you, if you have not already done so, to find local partners, whether it be directly with an institution of higher education or a business organization, to seek out and foster the economists of tomorrow.\n\nThose economists, after all, are the ones who will eventually be sitting and standing where we are today. And we are going to want them to look back at this convening and build upon our work and progress not because we have all the answers, but because we recognize that we don’t and that many questions are yet to be asked.\n\nWith that, I will conclude my prepared remarks. I thank you, again, for being part of this conference. And I look forward to our conversation.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome once again to Day 2 of this inaugural Anchor Economy Conference.\n\nMy thanks to Deborah Diamond for that introduction — and more on her later! My thanks, as well, to the Healthcare Anchor Network for cosponsoring this conference with the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nI also thank my friend and former colleague among higher education leaders, Johns Hopkins University President Ron Daniels, for joining me onstage for this morning’s discussion.\n\nAnd, of course, my thanks to each and every one of you with us today for bringing your ideas, your questions, and your spirit of partnership to these proceedings.\n\nBefore I go any further, I do need to stop for just a few seconds of official business — the official Fed disclaimer! The views I express this morning are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nI am eager to get to our conversation, so allow me to keep my remarks relatively brief. There will be plenty of time for us to get more granular.\n\nOne month ago, I spoke before a gathering of regional college and university administrators. I noted how we at the Philadelphia Fed take great pride in our research acumen — but we take even more pride in the partnerships that take that research to the next level. We are not conducting research just to engage in academic discourse or draw visitors to our website. We also take our research directly into our communities, engaging with organizations and stakeholders working on their own plans for expanding local and regional economic opportunities.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Anchor Economy Initiative is a remarkable example of this concept of research in action.\n\nWhat Deborah Diamond and her team have undertaken can only be described as groundbreaking. Never before has the national and regional economic impact of eds and meds anchor institutions been so fully captured. This is research that truly matters to the economic futures of hundreds of communities.\n\nAs you may know, prior to coming to the Philadelphia Fed, I served as president of the University of Delaware. I knew through my first-hand experiences that the university had an outsized economic and social impact that reached far beyond its Newark campus. Yet, I never knew just how large that impact was in terms of concrete metrics, and how much of an additive effect the university had to the impact of all the other anchors located throughout the greater Philadelphia statistical region.\n\nWell, now I know. And even nearly 10 years removed from the president’s office, I am in awe of not only just how big that impact is but how important the entire anchor economy is to the region’s overall economic health and vitality.\n\nMoreover, I know I’m not alone in this sentiment.\n\nThis is the real function of the Anchor Economy Initiative. It is not about research for the sake of research.\n\nIt is about spurring the imagination of leaders throughout the anchor economy to envision how their impacts can be multiplied by working with other anchor institutions in their own backyards.\n\nIt is about spurring engagement to collaboratively tackle long-standing economic and social issues in the communities we all serve.\n\nAt the center of this effort lays the Anchor Economy Dashboard, where all these data live, and the bullseye is the dashboard’s Anchor Reliance Index, which boils down numerous economic metrics into one score. It tells us how dependent a given region is on anchor institutions relative to the U.S. as a whole. In other words, the dashboard is a wealth of data, and the Anchor Reliance Index puts that data into perspective and allows us to easily compare one region to another.\n\nAnd this brings me to the heart of my remarks today.\n\nWhen created, the dashboard and reliance index gave us a snapshot of the nation’s anchor economy as of 2019, the most recent year unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But we recently expanded the underlying data to now provide a direct comparison and contrast to 2004, the furthest back we could go and still maintain consistency with input data. This gives us the ability to now look at the 2019 data with fresh eyes and in greater perspective.\n\nAnd diving into the deeper data, we can draw several conclusions, but two, in particular, stand out.\n\nFirst, the data show that the economic impacts of, and reliance upon, eds and meds are unique to statistical regions. We may certainly find many similarities among and between regions. But anchor reliance and anchor impact remain independent.\n\nAnd this leads us to the second major conclusion — any movement either up or down along the Anchor Reliance Index must be taken within the greater context of broader regional economic trends.\n\nAllow me to speak to a few examples.\n\nIn some postindustrial cities, we saw some dramatic increases in Anchor Reliance Index scores between 2004 and 2019. Over that 15-year span, these region’s eds and meds took on a greater burden and share of their local economies. However, this may not be the positive development we wish to presume it is.\n\nIn these cases, this growth came in the context of slowdowns, or even shutdowns, in other sectors. In other words, while these eds and meds grew in terms of jobs and total GDP — a good thing — it was at a greater rate than the rest of the region’s economy — a potentially not-so-good thing. This could mean that an increasing reliance on anchor institutions may actually signal an unsustainable over-reliance.\n\nAnd likewise, a decreasing reliance score could signal two things. One, a slowdown in the anchor economy and its related sectors — think of a local college or university facing a falloff in enrollments with subsequent layoffs and budget tightening, or the closure of a regional medical center, or the movement of a set of services away from a center to another located elsewhere. Both outcomes would have direct and indirect impacts on regional economic activity through the loss of jobs and incomes.\n\nBut, two, a decreasing Reliance Index score could also signal an increase in sectors of the regional economy that are distinct from eds and meds. This is what we are seeing in some growing metro areas in the Southwest and Mountain West, for example.\n\nThen there is the scenario in which both Philadelphia and Baltimore find ourselves. And this, I hope, can help seed my conversation with President Daniels, which we’re going to get to very soon, I promise!\n\nBetween 2004 and 2019, both Baltimore and Philadelphia saw an almost parallel increase in their respective Anchor Reliance Index scores — Philadelphia increased from 1.31 to 1.39, while Baltimore rose from 1.28 to 1.35.\n\nBut what drove this? In both cities’ metro regions, anchor economy–based GDP rose significantly: 41 percent in the Philly metro and 49 percent growth in Baltimore, outpacing the growth of other sectors, thereby increasing anchor reliance.\n\nIn both regions, the share of employment impacted by anchors — both direct and indirect — rose. In Philadelphia the increase was by 2 percentage points to 13 percent and in Baltimore by one point, from 11 percent to 12 percent.\n\nFive of Philadelphia’s top 10 employers fit into the eds and meds space, while in Baltimore it is 8 of the top 10.\n\nSo, certainly, the anchor economy in both regions, and its impact, grew at a greater proportion than other sectors. But, in both of these scenarios, this increased reliance may not inherently be a bad thing.\n\nBoth Philadelphia and Baltimore can broadly be considered “college towns.” But instead of just one campus, there are multiple institutions within each. These institutions are helping to seed the broader innovation economy, with direct pipelines of talent and funding into the growing life-science and innovation sectors, to name just two. Further, many of the higher education anchors also operate legacy health care anchors where cutting-edge research is being undertaken and commercialized and where health equity is being advanced.\n\nFor both Philadelphia and Baltimore, a growing eds and med reliance appears to be helping to offset, or even replace, the economic losses from the decline in the manufacturing sector.\n\nAs I have said, these are just a few examples. And if you haven’t been taking notes over the past several minutes, that’s fine, as I have recently published an essay covering these thoughts on the Philadelphia Fed website. This is also the topic of a research brief I coauthored with Deborah Diamond and our colleagues Theresa Dunne and Sisi Zhang.\n\nI hope that you will be interested in reading either or both.\n\nAt their cores, the Anchor Economy Dashboard and this subsequent research are powerful tools to compare regions.\n\nBut even more, they are powerful tools that stakeholders in each region can have at their disposal to put challenges in perspective and show a path for collaboration that can strengthen long-term economic prospects. As I wrote for our website, “The power of data is the power to make positive change.”\n\nAnd I certainly hope you will look at the data for your region, take it back to share with your stakeholders — both within your institution and within your broader community — to build that better economic future.\n\nThat all said, I don’t want to keep us away from our feature presentation any longer. Thank you all for being here and for allowing me these moments to speak with you, but now it’s time for me to step back, sit down, and bring President Daniels into our conversation.",

            "content": "Good afternoon!\n\nIt is a pleasure to be back with you once again, and I thank today’s organizers and sponsors for making it all possible.\n\nIt is also a pleasure to return to the University of Delaware, which you all know holds a very special place in my heart. This university continues to live up to its motto, “Knowledge is the light of the mind,” in everything it does, including opening its doors for forums such as this.\n\nI do not wish to take away from the conversation that will follow, so with your approval, I will start right into my economic outlook.\n\nBut obviously, before I can do that, I must first provide the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express this afternoon are my own and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nA lot has certainly changed since I joined you for this event last January.\n\nAt that time, we were in the midst of a program of fed funds rate increases to get a handle on inflation. When I spoke to you last time, the rate had just been increased to a range of 4¼-to-4½ percent. Today, as I stand here, it is 100 basis points higher — a full percentage point.\n\nYet, while the policy interest rate is indeed 1 point higher, the inflation rate is down by a much greater amount. When we met in January 2023, core PCE inflation stood at 4.9 percent year over year. Now, we won’t receive the January 2024 core PCE number until next week, but just looking at December’s year-over-year rate of 2.9 percent, well, that is significant improvement. Moreover, for the last six or seven months, core PCE inflation has been running essentially at a rate of 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation target.\n\nLast week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in with headline inflation at 3.1 percent year over year in January — a 0.3 percent dip from December — and core CPI inflation at 3.9 percent annually, holding steady from the prior month. Now, comparing that to the prior year, in January 2023, headline CPI was at 6.4 percent year over year, and core CPI was at 5.6 percent. So, again, there’s measured progress.\n\nBut we are bound to have bumps along the road to disinflation. Indeed, the latest CPI data mildly surprised analysts on the upside, as the drop in rents we see is only slowly passing through into the inflation numbers. And as progress can be bumpy — and uneven at times — it is important that we see more evidence, allowing us to look past the vagaries of monthly data and ensure we continue on the right path.\n\nRegardless, the data overall suggest that we are in the final mile of the marathon of getting PCE inflation back down to our target annual rate of 2 percent. However, as anyone who has ever run a marathon can tell you, the final mile is often the hardest.\n\n“So, Pat,” I hear you asking, “where do we go from here?” Well, let me get the headline statement out of the way right now.\n\nYes, I believe that we may be in the position to see the rate decrease this year. But I would caution anyone from looking for it right now and right away. We have time to get this right, as we must. And to be sure, next month’s meeting and FOMC vote will mark the second of eight scheduled meetings for 2024.\n\nI would characterize my stance at the moment as the old, oft-used adage: “Trust but verify.” I certainly have confidence that monetary policy is working as it should — and the trend lines on disinflation only add to that — but I’m not quite yet at the “verified” moment. And what I am doing in verifying is compiling more evidence.\n\nWhat I will be looking for in the hard data will be the distribution of disinflation among goods and services. As I think back to 2021, when we saw the prices of used cars jump, the predominant thinking was that the inflation spike mostly reflected transitory factors. But then other goods and services experienced rapid inflation, and we realized that inflation was becoming more entrenched across the economy.\n\nToday, I’m looking at the same things, but rather in reverse. Yes, the disinflation trend has picked up the pace — as I noted, the six-month core PCE is now consistent with inflation under 2 percent — but I again want to make sure that we are seeing disinflation across goods and services.\n\nI have said before that there are three things that I look at most closely in inflation reports: transportation, food, and shelter. These are the three things that matter the most directly to the overwhelming majority of American families. Well, transportation inflation is down from its peak, though it remains elevated. Food inflation, while certainly prone to fluctuations because of a host of factors, is generally down and back to normal levels on a year-over-year basis. Shelter inflation remains elevated, though I do recognize the lags inherent in the way it is calculated.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, I find our greatest economic risk comes from acting to lower the rate too early, lest we reignite inflation and see the work of the past two years unwind before our eyes.\n\nAlong with our work on the policy rate, we have also been reducing the size of the Fed’s balance sheet — what is known as quantitative tightening. That may describe what it is, but not its purpose. I prefer to use the term balance sheet normalization.\n\nWhen we announced this plan in May 2022, we stated an intention to significantly reduce the balance sheet until reserve balances were “ample,” or, simply, when the balance sheet size returned to “normal.” Well, we’re nearly two years in, so, how is it going?\n\nThere is no question that we have already achieved a significant reduction in the balance sheet of nearly $1.5 trillion. And we are not done yet, as reserves remain very abundant, albeit less so than in 2022.\n\nWhen we announced this program, we also said that normalization would proceed in “a predictable manner.” And to make good on that count, we must slow as we approach normal. For this reason, and to make good on my promise of making normalization as boring as watching paint dry, my colleagues and I will start our discussions on how to slow the balance sheet reduction at the March FOMC meeting.\n\nWhether it be with the balance sheet or the policy rate, the overriding concern is to get everything right at the right time because the economy continues to hum along.\n\nGDP growth continues to be strong.\n\nWhile the labor market continues to post strong monthly gains and unemployment remains near historic lows, we are also seeing multiple signs that the labor market is coming into better balance, and the very tight conditions that characterized the immediate post-pandemic period are easing. The latest data show that the ratio of openings to unemployment continues to back down closer to its pre-pandemic readings. Labor force participation improved in the last year — and this is especially important since the linchpin to any growing economy is an active labor force. Wage inflation has also moderated substantially.\n\nBut at the same time, we are not experiencing widespread layoffs. Yes, certain sectors are readjusting their workforces, most notably the tech sector, but there are not economy-wide layoffs that would suggest some recessionary forces are fighting their way to the forefront. Again, this is a good thing.\n\nConsumer spending also continues to remain strong. Moreover, the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment reported its highest level in two-and-a-half years — and consumer expectations for future inflation have come down.\n\nThis is a promising signal and one that we will be looking at closely in other areas of the economy as it has largely been the American consumer who has kept on the path of achieving an economic soft landing. But on the flip side of this, I am somewhat concerned about the increase of delinquencies in credit card and other loan repayments, especially among younger borrowers and families on the lower end of the income ladder.\n\nThis picture being painted by the hard data is also backed up by what I am hearing from contacts throughout the Third District; this is the soft data upon which I place a great amount of importance because it’s the real-time check that I need in my own decision-making.\n\nWhen it comes to consumers, I heard months ago that they continued to spend, though they have been switching to other brands to find better deals and putting more on their credit cards, rather than just closing their wallets.\n\nAnd from employers, I’ve been hearing that while they are still hiring, they are now looking for workers with more specific and necessary skill sets. As for the workers they’ve already hired, well, they’re going to do what they can to hold on to them.\n\nThis sentiment is backed by the survey data in the latest Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, or MBOS, conducted by the Philadelphia Fed in which firms in the Third District reported a six-month expectation for steady employment. Employers may be looking to alter hours or making other arrangements so that things work for their operations, but the hiring free-for-all that we experienced in the inflationary run-up is over while we do not see any drastic adjustments to payrolls.\n\nAnother MBOS data point that gives me confidence is the trend of the index for prices paid for inputs, which, though it has jumped a little from time to time, has been on a marked downward trend since late 2021. Moreover, in a specific special question asked for the January survey regarding price expectations for the upcoming year, the average expected change in costs was below the rate that they reported experiencing in 2023.\n\nSo, where does all this leave us? I’ll go back to my initial statement. I do believe we may be near the point where we can adjust the policy rate downward. But when we will actually arrive at that point, I cannot yet say.\n\nAnd just to note, I don’t have a vote on the FOMC this year, but I still have a voice in our policy discussions and intend to use it.\n\nJust like last summer, when I was a voting member of the FOMC and I signaled my belief early that it was time to hold rates steady, I will signal my belief that we’re ready for a rate decrease when all the data — both the hard and the soft — give me that signal.\n\nThe American economy is, to put it mildly, a dynamic engine. And right now, this engine is the strongest of any in the entire world. And though we’ve been bounced around by inflation’s potholes, our careful and steady approach to monetary policy has kept the engine running smoothly and the tires of our economy on the ground. Our actions thus far have seen us progress to our destination without the broader economy sliding into a roadside ditch.\n\nBut obviously, we can’t take our eyes off the road. We want to get to our destination without any warning lights going off or tires going flat. And at this moment, the indications are that we can do that — but only if we stay focused and controlled with our hands on the wheel. We can’t go too heavy on the gas too soon, lest we lose control or pass our exit completely and have to reroute.\n\nSo, to end where I began, what a difference a year makes. It has been a year of progress. And as we continue moving deeper into 2024, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia will remain a partner in the continued economic progress of our region and our nation.\n\nThank you very much.",

            "content": "Good evening, everyone.\n\nFirst of all, thank you, Rosy, for that introduction. It is not only a treat to have a student introduce me, but an economics student, at that!\n\nI must note that this is my first public engagement of 2024. As a native of South Jersey — I am Gloucester City born and raised — it is an honor to open my year here with all of you. So, I must thank Dr. Ben Dworkin for the invitation to be here.\n\nInstitutes such as the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship are not just vital for elevating our civic dialogue today, but they are critical for ensuring that the next generation of leaders — the students in this room — have the tools to ensure open, honest, and civil dialogue about tomorrow’s opportunities and challenges.\n\nI also must recognize my friend and former colleague among college presidents, Dr. Ali Houshmand. I was president of the University of Delaware when Dr. Houshmand took the reins here at Rowan and remain impressed by everything he and this university are accomplishing.\n\nThe Third Federal Reserve District, while the smallest of the 12 Districts, is home to many of the nation’s leading institutions of higher education — Rowan University definitely included. The Third District punches well above its weight.\n\nAllow me to dispense with a little bit of business right away, and that is the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express tonight are my own and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAs a former university professor, dean, and president, I am approaching this evening as “Fed 101” with a little history of the Federal Reserve System, insight into what we at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia do, and how I see our work impacting the future regional and national economies.\n\nAnd for the students here who are considering their own future careers and are not necessarily economics majors, I hope you may hear something tonight — whether in these remarks or during our discussion — through which you can imagine yourself serving our nation and economy at the Fed.\n\nI recognize that for some here the Fed may seem almost like Punxsutawney Phil, where we pop up every six weeks or so to announce a decision on interest rates. But as I hope to show you, while this may be what gets the Fed more headlines than anything, we are much more than just interest rates.\n\nTo that, while I recognize that last week’s vote of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee — the FOMC — made headlines, I am not going to dive deep into the minutiae of monetary policy in these remarks. That’s for two reasons. One, I don’t want to put anyone to sleep. The second reason is that we are going to have plenty of time for our Q&A.\n\nAnd, truth be told, while I certainly enjoy speaking to you, I would much rather get into those questions submitted to Ben and have a conversation with you.\n\nSo, first, I do want to give a brief history of the Federal Reserve. To understand how the Fed works today, one must first understand how it came into being.\n\nFor much of the first 125 years of our nation’s economic, financial, and political history, the banking sector remained independent and largely unregulated by any central authority. The first two attempts at creating something we might call a central bank — creatively named the First and Second Banks of the United States, respectively — lasted a total of 40 years between 1791 and 1836.\n\nStanding in the center of the national banking effort was someone whose name is familiar to everyone in this room: Alexander Hamilton, our first Secretary of the Treasury and future Broadway sensation. Hamilton believed that the economic future of the United States hinged upon having a sound and stable financial system — and creating such a system, he argued, required a national bank.\n\nWhile both banks of the United States were the national government’s fiscal agents for their time, they were nothing like what we have with the Federal Reserve today. They were competitor institutions to state and local banks. And neither could set national monetary policy in any true sense. They printed and distributed their own currency — backed by a gold reserve — and could purchase and hold notes issued by state and local banks as a means of controlling the amount of currency in circulation, but that was the extent of it.\n\nBut little matter, as neither bank lasted beyond its initial charter. The national bank experiment in the United States seemed over by the time the Second Bank’s congressional charter expired in 1836, and it folded for good when its privatized operations ceased in 1841.\n\nFor the next 80 years, the American financial system was underpinned by state-chartered banks and, later during and after the Civil War, nationally chartered banks. But those underpinnings were weak. Absent a central financial or economic authority, the nation’s financial system lurched through a series of panics as banks collapsed under the weight of speculative investments, loan defaults and bankruptcies, or an inability to repay their customers’ deposits.\n\nAfter a particularly stressing panic in 1907 — a financial storm matched only by the 2008 banking crisis and exceeded only by the Great Depression — the need for a new system of central banking became evident. Out of that experience came the Federal Reserve System, itself a truly American invention.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is, by design, one that can best be described as an independent and decentralized central bank. What do I mean by that? Only the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System can be considered anything close to quote-unquote government. They are appointed by the president of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n\nBut the operations of the Fed are largely untethered to the fiscal operations of the United States government, which remain the purview of the president and Congress. And while the Fed operates in the fiscal and economic conditions fostered by the decisions of those policymakers, we do not step explicitly into the political arena.\n\nAdditionally, for me and my 11 colleagues at the District level, our banks are independently chartered institutions. And while the Board of Governors does have oversight over the operations of the 12 District banks, as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I do not answer directly to them in most operational matters but rather to the Philadelphia Fed’s own board of directors.\n\nYet, even while decentralized, the Federal Reserve System has been granted strong central authority. Unlike the nation’s first two attempts at protocentral banking, we do hold a direct responsibility for the nation’s monetary policy. And unlike the First and Second Banks of the United States, we are not a commercial bank. You cannot walk into the Philadelphia Fed and open a personal account. We are a bank for banks.\n\nIn Philadelphia, for example, we hold the reserves of the more than 100 regional and local member banks across Delaware, southern New Jersey, and eastern and central Pennsylvania. We clear their payments, and we supervise their operations and ensure their liquidity to instill public confidence in their operation and in our overall financial system.\n\nBut even more central to our mission, the Federal Reserve System works under a dual mandate given to us by Congress to ensure price stability and maximum employment across the economy.\n\nWhat does price stability mean? As monetary policymakers, it means targeting inflation at an annual rate of 2 percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures — more on that later. And this is the task we are currently focused on — getting inflation back down to 2 percent.\n\nAs for maximum employment, I take a perhaps more nuanced view than some economists. To me, achieving maximum employment is not just about promoting economic conditions through which everyone who wants a job can get one. Yes, job growth is important, but, to me, maximum employment also means promoting a climate in which work isn’t just something to be rewarded but something that is truly rewarding. Put another way, while the quantity of available jobs is important, so, too, is the quality of those jobs.\n\nThe main instrument for achieving our dual mandate is, as you can guess, the policy interest rate. Or the “target range for the effective federal funds rate,” if you want the full word salad.\n\nMonetary policy works, at a very high level, via demand management. What does that mean? The FOMC will set policy rates low if it believes that it is necessary to give the economy a little more gas by stimulating consumption and investment. If, instead, the FOMC needs to tamp down on an overheated economy to get inflation under control, it can set policy rates high, cooling consumers’ appetites and firms’ investment plans.\n\nThere are many subtleties to monetary policy, so sometimes the best action is to do nothing. If the economy’s current pace is on course to achieve the Fed’s dual mandate, we can let monetary policy do its work and see through the vagaries of the data.\n\nEight times a year, the presidents of all 12 Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors meet in Washington, D.C., to review economic data, discuss what is going on in our respective Districts, and to set the policy rate for the ensuing intermeeting period. That actual rate-setting vote is undertaken by the FOMC, which is composed of the Fed Chair and six other members of the Board of Governors, the president of the New York Fed who has a permanent seat, and four other Bank presidents who get a vote on the FOMC in a yearly rotation.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed is in a rotation with the Banks in Boston and Richmond. My last turn was in 2023, so while I continue to participate in our meetings this year, I will not have a vote on the FOMC. But to be clear, the voices of all 19 members around the table are heard equally.\n\nAs a quick aside, my 10-year term-limited stint as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed will come to a close early next summer. This means I will have spent three full rotations as a voting member of the FOMC: in 2017, 2020, and 2023. Each turn is important, but looking at just those last two, it means I had a vote during incredibly important years: In 2020, as we worked to insulate the economy as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and again last year as we wrestled to bring inflation to heel while not simultaneously plunging the economy into recession.\n\nThe FOMC’s most recent decision to hold the policy rate steady is one I support. The data point to continued disinflation, to labor markets coming into better balance, and to resilient consumer spending — three elements necessary for us to stick to the soft landing we remain optimistic to achieve.\n\nAnd this gets me to the next section of my remarks: how I land at my decisions.\n\nCertainly, monetary policy and economics in general is a science based on numbers and data. And we are not lacking in economic data. For example, when it comes to inflation, we have not one but two monthly indicators on inflation. The first, and probably more widely known, is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The other, which is growing in stature, is the aforementioned Personal Consumption Expenditure price index, or PCE index.\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, we look more closely at PCE, as it better captures how consumers are reacting to changing prices, perhaps by substituting one good or service for another. This type of information is invaluable in our deliberations, especially in conditions we have seen recently as the economy, even in light of elevated inflation, remained strong on the shoulders of sustained consumer spending.\n\nThe PCE data released two Fridays ago highlight the ongoing progress in bringing inflation back to target. The December reading of core inflation that strips out volatile food and energy costs was 2.9 percent year over year from December 2022. That is down 0.3 percent from November and marked the first time since 2021 that core PCE had dipped under 3 percent annual growth. Indeed, one year ago, annual core PCE inflation was 4.9 percent. So, while inflation does remain above target, real progress is being made.\n\nWhile essential to our jobs, these hard data also come with limitations, the most glaring of which is that each data set is, almost by definition, backward looking. Data are lagging indicators. For example, it is well recognized that the CPI has long been several months behind, if not longer, in capturing on-the-ground changes in rents, so much so that a new measure of rents is being brought online to hopefully close this lag.\n\nSo, I also place a significant importance on soft data — the real-time experiences and observations that I get by talking to contacts throughout the Third District. I recently wrote about this in an essay on the Philadelphia Fed website, which I would encourage you to read.\n\nBalancing hard and soft data allows me to create a more dynamic approach to the issues. And it can give me the reasoning I need to even change my course.\n\nAbout two years ago, I was considered one of the Federal Reserve’s hawks, a supporter of our program of quickly increasing the policy rate to pull back on the economy’s reins to slow inflation.\n\nBy last spring, even as the FOMC continued the rate run-up, and even as the hard data showed inflation remaining stubbornly well above target, I began to hear from my contacts that things were slowing more than the numbers were telling us — and that while monetary tightening was having its intended effect, it was also having a potential downside impact on their businesses and operations.\n\nFrom our community bank partners especially, I heard fears that some small business borrowers could be in precarious positions as their loans matured and rolled over to new lines at higher rates that their business models may not be able to sustain.\n\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we also conduct surveys of contacts throughout the Third District. Perhaps the most well-known are the Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey — or MBOS — and the Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey of service industry contacts — or NBOS. Each gives us a more real-time assessment of future outlooks and sentiments within these sectors.\n\nThe soft data were telling me our economy needed time to breathe and catch up. And in time, this became evident in the hard data. So, I adjusted my position accordingly. I was then considered a dove as one of the first members of the FOMC to voice my opinion that we had reached the time for us to hold rates steady.\n\nAlthough, let’s be honest, I’m not a hawk or a dove. I’m a South Jersey boy who grew up playing football — I’ll always be an Eagle!\n\nNow, was I wrong in my prior support for and votes to increase the policy rate? No. We needed to act to tame inflation. And was I wrong in my early support for holding the rate steady? Also no, because it became evident to me that our prior actions were having their intended effect.\n\nThe economy is a very dynamic instrument, and it requires a balanced and dynamic approach. And it is this approach that, I believe, has put us on the path to a soft landing. Now certainly we haven’t touched down, and we’re going to have to keep our seatbelts on, but with inflation continuing to fall back to our 2 percent target, with employment remaining strong, and with consumer sentiment looking up, the runway at our destination is in sight.\n\nThis dynamic aspect is the part of the job that I enjoy the most, perhaps because I am not a classically trained economist. By education, I’m actually a Ph.D. engineer moonlighting as an economist. No, really. In fact, the reason why I got into economics was to help solve an engineering problem. I was working on a federal Department of Energy grant back in the 1980s modeling the transport of coal by rail.\n\nI needed to better understand the economic side of these transports for my modeling, so I went back to school and eventually came out with a second master’s degree.\n\nRegardless, if there’s one thing you know about engineers, it’s that we’re always looking for a way to make systems run more efficiently. For me, this includes our economy and everything else that the economy touches, which happens to be just about everything. And this is one reason why I love the work we do at the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nOne project in which we are currently engaged is the Anchor Economy Initiative. Through this, our researchers are taking a deep dive into the economic impacts that hospitals and institutions of higher education have on their home regions and, for the first time, have captured these impacts in 524 statistical areas across the nation.\n\nThis is work that matters even here at Rowan — after all, this is a research university with a medical school. Because of our proximity tonight to Philadelphia, and the inclusion of Gloucester County in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington statistical area, we can see the additive impact this institution has on the regional economy. In this statistical area alone, anchor institutions directly and indirectly impact the employment of more than 495,000 residents, provide wages totaling nearly $34 billion, and add more than $50 billion in overall economic value.\n\nAnd toward Atlantic City, the anchor economy accounts for 8 percent of regional employment, 6.5 percent of its income, and nearly 9 percent of its GDP.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, these are big numbers.\n\nOne reason I have a great amount of passion for the Anchor Economy Initiative is because, by putting this impact into perspective, it can allow us to engage more deeply with these institutions to tackle long-standing economic and social issues in the communities we all serve.\n\nAs a former college president, I know that the institution I served — the University of Delaware — wasn’t an island unto its own. I knew it had an outsized role in the economic and social fabric that reached far beyond its Newark campus and into three adjoining states, given both the university’s location and Delaware’s size. I may now be nearly 10 years removed from the president’s office, but I'm increasingly aware of just how big this role is.\n\nAnd I hope other leaders across the anchor economy space — whether they be higher-education leaders or health-care leaders — can not only see how much of an off-campus impact they have, too, but can imagine how their future impact can be multiplied by working with other institutions in their own neighborhoods.\n\nAnd beyond that, our Community Development and Regional Outreach Department helps build partnerships and kick-start local economic initiatives in cities throughout the Third District. Every year, I and many of my colleagues travel to these communities to check in, see their progress on issues as varied as affordable housing and small business development, and plan future next steps. You may have read about the trip Fed Chair Jay Powell made to York, Pennsylvania, with me this past October to tour small businesses there and sit down with local business leaders and workers.\n\nWhether I wear my economist or engineer hat, I think this is pretty cool stuff. But it also exemplifies the type of work we do every day at the Philadelphia Fed to be an active and engaged partner in our region’s life and future.\n\nAnd just as in my former life in academia, I know the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia isn’t an island unto itself, and our work cannot be limited to the financial sector and monetary policy alone. We know the impact that the decisions made by the Fed have on our constituent communities. My goal — our goal — must be for the Philadelphia Fed to be seen as an active partner and participant in the economic life and futures of these communities.\n\nAnd the best way to do that is to find that balance between hard data and soft data and to always be eager to listen and be open to discussion.\n\nSo, on that note, I am eager to open a discussion with all of you. So, allow me to conclude my set remarks by once again thanking Ben, RIPPAC, and Rowan University for the opportunity to join you all this evening. Now, let’s get to your questions.",

            "content": "Good evening, everyone.\n\nTo everyone here at the Northwestern University Transportation Center, it is indeed an honor to have been asked to present this year’s Leon N. Moses Distinguished Lecture.\n\nNow, if I may, here is how I intend to proceed tonight. I will begin by answering what could be a central question to the evening: “Why does a president of a Federal Reserve Bank care about transportation?”\n\nFrom there, I will share a broad outline of some of the research being conducted by the staff at the Philadelphia Fed, which, I believe, can be put into action to help us achieve a stronger economic and more reliable transportation future.\n\nI will conclude by providing my economic outlook. After all, I’ll note that the Moses Lectures in 2011 and 2017 both centered on U.S. economic outlooks, so why break unnecessarily from this apparent six-year cycle? Also, I am acutely aware of the impact that interest rates and monetary policy can have on infrastructure investments.\n\nAnd if time allows, I would be happy to engage in a discussion and answer any questions to add further clarity to our proceedings.\n\nBut first, my day job requires me to make one thing very clear. And that is the usual Federal Reserve disclaimer. So, please note that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOr as folks back home in the Philadelphia region know, when talking about this evening, please say, “Pat said,” not “The Fed said.”\n\nNow, with all that business out of the way, let’s dive in.\n\nI should start by recognizing that I find myself in very like-minded company. My predominant area of study, after all, wasn’t economics. It was civil engineering. Economics was that side project that later became my full-time job. But my way of looking at things — even in economics — is very much with that same lens I ground in my engineering days.\n\nNow, let me take this a step further. As an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a stable economy that provides opportunities for everyone to grow and succeed. As an engineer, and specifically as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe, reliable, and stable infrastructure, which provides opportunities for all communities to grow and succeed.\n\nI know I am far from the first person to recognize this important interdisciplinary relationship. I can just look around this room to know there are many others who do as well. And fittingly enough, all the way back in 1917, John Hayford, then director of the College of Engineering here at Northwestern University, wrote an essay in the Journal of Political Economy titled “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” from which I will read the following:\n\nEconomics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as the social science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be defined to be physical science applied to helping groups … to make a better living.1\n\nThose words ring just as true 106 years later.\n\nBut in my current capacity, I can look to the Federal Reserve’s own dual mandate, the two pillars of our institutional mission that Congress handed to us in the late 1970s: price stability and maximum employment. And neither, I could argue, are achievable without some level of modern transportation infrastructure, and more specifically, engineering for modern transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe ability of goods and services to flow to and from markets helps ensure that prices can remain stable. And we cannot achieve maximum employment unless employers have accessible places in which to site their businesses and workers have a way to get to and from those places of employment.\n\nNow, certainly, the Federal Reserve does not build transport infrastructure. But the monetary policy decisions we make and implement have a direct impact on the ability of those actors responsible for such actions to undertake them. I will return to this thought later in my economic outlook.\n\nBut with this overall intellectual background, where do we find ourselves at this moment? By any measure, we are at a critical time not just in our economy, but for our infrastructure. We are now roughly 70 years removed from our nation’s last, great infrastructure boom, including the construction of the Interstate Highway System. And as with most things, time isn’t always kind. The conditions of our infrastructure call out for broad investment, and the conditions of our economy require us to look anew at what infrastructure means to our overall health, both literally and figuratively.\n\nWithout a doubt, the United States would not be the preeminent global economy if not for our infrastructure. We are a vast nation, and our roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, and airports are very much the ties that bind the union together. But in what condition do we currently find these ties?\n\nFor the past almost 70 years, we have been in a mode to maintain the infrastructure we currently have. We became very good at fixing things, and, let’s face it, we still are. Case in point: When a section of Interstate 95 in Northeast Philadelphia collapsed this summer — practically paralyzing the East Coast’s most essential transit corridor — it only took a matter of days for an ingenious repair plan to be put into place and the road reopened. But in some ways, this is the exception to the usual cycle of infrastructure repair, as it took cutting through red tape and a quicker-than-usual accounting of the economic activity being lost for officials to spring into action at such speed.\n\nTransportation infrastructure, as we all know, is expensive to undertake and often slow to accomplish.\n\nBut the I-95 collapse and rebuild could also become a pivot point for the way we look at infrastructure. I could argue that the way many have traditionally looked at infrastructure is much akin to the old Oscar Wilde line about those who “[know] the price of everything and the value of nothing.” We’ve become very good at knowing how much a project will cost, but we haven’t been as good at explaining the value of a project — the long-range economic and quality of life benefits inherent in it. And so, I would say this is not just a time for us to get better at fixing, but a time for us to take a fuller stock of the results of what we built in the first place and the long-term implications of what we may build in the future.\n\nI-95 in Philadelphia in itself is a good example for us to examine both of these thoughts. And, at the Philadelphia Fed, it’s also perfectly located for us to do just that.\n\nIf you travel on I-95 through Philadelphia, it stands out in several ways. The first is more sensory and tactile: I-95 severed the residents of Philadelphia from the Delaware River waterfront. In the 1950s, the riverfront was overwhelmingly industrial, and the residential areas located on it were older, so little thought was likely given to the construction of an elevated highway with better water views than the newer buildings and houses to its west.\n\nBut I-95 was also constructed in an age when suburban living became the new model of the American Dream, and when highways could speed families out of city centers and into new single-family home developments, complete with yards and driveways, in neighboring counties. And when a highway was built, the noise and air pollution from that many cars and trucks helped push those who could afford it toward those new suburban developments.\n\nLast year, two of my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, Vice President and Economist Jeffrey Lin and Economic Advisor and Economist Jeffrey Brinkman, took a closer look at I-95, its impact in depopulating Philadelphia, and the potential benefits of capping the highway.2\n\nAnd Lin, I should note, is a Wildcat, having completed his undergraduate studies in economics and mathematical methods in the social sciences here at Northwestern, and studied under Dr. Leon Moses.\n\nSo, my colleagues started by looking at the population effects of freeways on central city neighborhoods, and what they found, if not startling, is still stark. The standard narrative is that freeways provide access to opportunities. And this was true in the suburbs — freeways attracted development and population. But this was decidedly not the case in central cities. Lin and Brinkman found, in central cities, a population decline of nearly one-third in the census tracts closest to freeways, while the populations in the tracts more than two miles from the nearest freeway increased by more than 50 percent. And the decline in those neighborhoods closer to a freeway makes sense, not just because of noise and pollution, but because of the negative barrier effects to local amenities — the dead-ending of streets that previously provided through access to jobs or shopping, making previously straight-forward trips longer for residents.\n\nLin and Brinkman also calculated the value of neighborhood amenities in areas of Philadelphia closest to freeways to be roughly 11 percent lower than in those areas farther out — and in a similar analysis, they found a 17 percent difference in Chicago.\n\nEngineering created a means for speeding people and goods between cities and from city centers and into suburbia, and beyond. The Interstate Highway System was an enormous achievement, and it created big benefits for some. It also had enormous costs for others, especially residents of central cities.\n\nBut engineering now has the opportunity to mitigate some of that damage, to eliminate barriers to amenities, and in the process, create new economic incentives for folks to move back and opportunities for those who stayed.\n\nWe know, through both anecdotal evidence and through frontier research, that more people, especially young college graduates, are looking anew at urban living.3, 4 New work from home options means that cities and towns are competing even more on the quality of life they can offer residents. Additionally, traffic throughout the Philadelphia Metro area has become so endemic that one of those initial benefits of living in the suburbs — speedy access to the urban core — has been all but eliminated.\n\nThe Philadelphia waterfront today is a place where former warehouses and factories are being repurposed and renovated for residential and more ground-level commercial uses. The Delaware River itself is also a cleaner estuary, and one which the city has continually sought to highlight for both residents and tourists through projects like the Penn’s Landing Festival Pier, the multimodal Delaware River Trail, and a just-started project to cap a one-10th of a mile portion of I-95 at Penn’s Landing to become a new urban park.\n\nAnd Lin and Brinkman even looked at this last idea: capping I-95 to reconnect neighborhoods with amenities. But they looked at a much bigger landscape than the current project, which is geared to only a small part of I-95 adjacent to the neighborhoods directly east of Center City and the tourist and business heart. They conceived of a project to cover a little more than four miles of I-95 and simulated its potential impact. And what their simulation suggests is a potential population boom in those neighborhoods that I-95 effectively cut off and to some extent emptied, as connections between those neighborhoods and the city at-large were remade.\n\nThey also calculated that the benefit to households in these neighborhoods at roughly $245 million per year, or $3.5 billion over the lifetime value of such a project, was greater than the estimated current cost of undertaking such a program. These are big numbers. What they point to is the significant damage that highway construction did to central city neighborhoods. What they also point to are the significant current opportunities for remediating that damage, if we can also focus on the value of these investments, instead of only the costs.\n\nBut it’s not just about planting grass. While parks and open space are vital, we cannot discount infrastructure that could link neighborhoods together. Public transit has potentially a large role to play here. With limited exceptions of, for example, the New York City Subway or Boston’s T, we often think of mass transit mostly in terms of bringing suburbanites back into cities. In Philadelphia, for example, the regional Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is often skewered by Philadelphians for a perception that it caters mostly to suburbanites — a gripe rooted in the fact that prepandemic, from 2007 to 2017, SEPTA’s suburban-based Regional Rail system received the plurality of the agency’s capital funds even though inner-city transit attracted far more riders.5  Fair or not, perception matters and can sway public acceptance.\n\nAgain, this is an area where there is guiding research from the Philadelphia Fed. Economic Advisor and Economist Chris Severen looked at the economic benefits of the Los Angeles Metro Rail system, an ambitious effort to draw people from the epicenter of the nation’s car culture out of their autos and into mass transit.6\n\nWhat Severen found was a 15 percent increase in transit use when Angelenos were commuting from one neighborhood to another directly connected by Metro Rail. The increase in Metro Rail commuting in directly adjacent census tracts was 10 percent.\n\nA common concern these days with local infrastructure investments is who benefits. Are the benefits going to incumbent residents who may have been harmed by past policy? Or are they going to incoming residents who end up displacing existing residents? On the other hand, some people might worry that transit access might actually hurt neighborhoods, for example, by introducing more noise or congestion. Interestingly, in the LA Metro case, these neighborhoods did not experience a lot of disruptive change. The appearance of a Metro Rail station did not bring in a new wealthy subset. What Metro Rail primarily did was to enhance resident choice of transportation options. It added an amenity in which residents found an intrinsic value — the ability to ditch their car. The added benefits of those cars that were kept off the streets, in terms of traffic, noise, and pollution, just become a bonus. More than that, it may have changed perceptions of transit as something only for the suburbs or wealthy residents. Again, this kind of research is helping us learn about the value of transportation infrastructure — the long-range economic and quality of life benefits.\n\nSuch infrastructure projects may be critical in undoing one of the great transportation engineering injustices of all. We now know that highways cut off people from opportunities today. But this might understate their negative effects on the next generation  — through increased racial segregation and the decreased intergenerational economic opportunities that continue to this day.\n\nAnd this brings me to a third bit of research in which the Philadelphia Fed was involved. Economic Advisor and Economist Bryan Stuart recently teamed up with researchers from the University of Texas and UCLA.7 Their window into these intergenerational effects was to look at the long-term economic impacts from the historical placement of railroads. And they found, true to the cliché, that there was a “wrong side of the tracks.” The placement of railroad tracks cemented segregation within communities and limited the upward mobility of specifically Black children who the tracks separated from community amenities such as schools and jobs.\n\nWe can see this in Philadelphia, too, which has the unfortunate distinction of being the “poorest big city” in the nation, and the 11th most racially segregated8 with a citywide poverty rate above 20 percent. But is this just a matter of bad luck for these families who find themselves below the poverty line? The research conducted by the Philadelphia Fed would say no. Many of these outcomes were caused by past policies. Many of them could be addressed through transportation infrastructure investments today to better connect workers, families, and opportunities.\n\nIn 2022, Larry Santucci, a senior advisor and research fellow at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute, released his work in which he mapped the history of racial covenants at nearly 4,000 properties citywide.9 Racially restrictive covenants were one of the tools that early 20th century developers, home builders, and White homeowners used to prevent non-White individuals from accessing certain neighborhoods and homes. Allow me a moment to explain the findings in Santucci’s own words:\n\nWe didn’t see a lot in areas of the city where the housing stock was older, such as along the Delaware waterfront, where White residents may have been happy to vacate … But we did find racial covenants bordering White and non-White neighborhoods and cordoning off the up-and-coming, more suburban areas in the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest sections of Philadelphia.\n\nOn a map, many of the areas of Philadelphia directly impacted by the growth of highways and the White flight it enabled stand out in this proposition. Santucci specifically notes the Delaware River waterfront, the example with which I opened this talk. But even today, residents in the majority Black neighborhoods of Philadelphia and the surrounding region face commute times, on average, that are 34 minutes longer per week than their White counterparts. Or put another way, in the span of a year, Black commuters lose a whole 24-hour day in commuting time that White commuters keep for themselves. That was the finding of another recent report by Severen and his Research Analyst Nassir Holden.10\n\nThis research can serve as the starting place for engineers and local officials, if not indeed federal ones, to take a more holistic approach to transportation. Simply making repairs, while necessary, in many ways will only extend or even exacerbate long-standing inequities and inequalities. Simply making a repair to a freeway that stands as an impediment to economic progress and equity won’t remove it as an impediment — it will only solidify its standing for more years.\n\nSimply valuing infrastructure in the same old way, usually by the flow of cars or people, is self-limiting. We should start valuing its benefits in greater totality, and especially the benefits to those who are situated near these projects. And the Philadelphia Fed’s research is helping us to better define these benefits.\n\nBut certainly, these improvements will not just happen on their own or through the benevolence of others. We must pay for them. Local governments collect taxes, some of which are used for local infrastructure, but most infrastructure projects have costs that require them to be bonded out over years. Those funds allow for construction workers to be employed and for materials to be purchased.\n\nAnd that is where the Federal Reserve’s actions can have an impact and where I, as a member of the FOMC, recognize my place in this transportation future, if even just tangentially. But our actions on monetary policy do have a direct impact on the borrowing rates for such bonds, among so much more. Our efforts to tame inflation mean stabilizing the costs of construction and labor.\n\nAnd with that, I would like to give you a brief overview of my overall economic outlook. As you are aware, a week ago, at our last meeting, the FOMC voted to hold the policy rate steady — our second consecutive hold and the third in the last four meetings after 10 consecutive interest rate hikes.\n\nI not only voted to support keeping the policy rate steady, but I was also among the first of my colleagues to state my position that the time had come to do so, possibly for a while. Let’s rewind for a moment. We did a lot in not a lot of time. We rapidly moved monetary policy into restrictive territory to tame inflation and get it heading back down to our target of a 2 percent annual rate.\n\nNow, what we didn’t do was give the folks living in this economy, whether businesses or families, a lot of time to adjust in between rate hikes. And today, if you look along the trend lines, we are experiencing a slow but steady disinflation. Interest rates remain in restrictive territory and, so long as they are, they will continue to put a damper on inflation.\n\nYes, this economy is proving to be resilient and at times unwilling to bend to the will of economic models, but I believe that the path we are on is the correct one.\n\nI am not going to be swayed easily by a single month’s worth of data. One month can just be an outlier and not a harbinger. But we don’t know unless we have more outward months to weigh against it. With monetary policy, there are always lags. Holding the rate steady will give those lags time to catch up. It will allow us to make more measured and educated policy rate decisions going forward — decisions, which I must add, could go either way, depending upon what the data tell us.\n\nBut for the moment, as I said, I see a slow but steady disinflation occurring. I still expect inflation to fall below 3 percent year over year in 2024 and to get down to our 2 percent target thereafter.\n\nI do expect GDP growth to cool off in the coming quarters, but I do not expect a recession.\n\nConsumers have been powering recent GDP growth — more than half of last quarter’s increase was due to consumers continuing to open their wallets. Time will tell if they have exhausted their pandemic-era savings and begin to ratchet down their own spending. Time will tell the full impact of the restart of student loan payments for countless borrowers. But I would also argue that a confident American consumer is not a problem. Indeed, they may be the ones ultimately capable of helping us achieve the soft landing we all envision and that has proved quite elusive in the past.\n\nIt is also clear that the labor market is coming into a much better balance. I anticipate the unemployment rate to end the year slightly elevated from where it currently stands — to about 4 percent — and to rise slowly in 2024 to about 4.5 percent before dropping again to 4 percent. That would put us back in line with the natural rate of unemployment, where the labor market and steady 2 percent inflation can coexist in balance.\n\nOf course, there are many lurking uncertainties. The positive movements to settle the auto worker strikes give us hope that things may soon return to normal for workers and employers. But even then, there are still other labor actions that are slowing down other industries, such as the actors’ strike.\n\nWe are also now only nine days away from a potential federal government shutdown, the impact of which would only grow the longer it goes on and could potentially trim a full percentage point off fourth quarter GDP. And of course, there are international issues that can impact our own economy.\n\nBut at the end of the day, while I see us on the path of taming inflation and protecting our economic underpinnings, I would also caution that a decrease in the policy rate is not something that is likely to happen in the short term. I ascribe to the position that rates are going to have to remain higher for longer, as the other downward pressures on inflation work in tandem with the current policy rate to return our economy to balance.\n\nAnd for transportation, this higher-rate climate may have an impact on our ability to see some new projects get from the drawing board to shovels in the ground. The necessary repairs will still be done, and projects already begun will continue.\n\nBut progress is something for which America has always been known. And the more we take our eyes exclusively off the costs of a project to the overall economic benefit of a project, the more we will see that price tags, while important, aren’t the only thing to consider.\n\nWe can still, if we take the research into consideration, make Oscar Wilde proud.\n\nAnd with that, I will conclude my prepared remarks for this evening. I once again thank you all for the privilege to be here. I would be happy to take your questions.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone.\n\nThank you to my Philadelphia Fed colleague, Ivy Washington, for that welcome and introduction. I must also acknowledge the efforts of one of my other colleagues from across the street, Robin Myers, for putting this program together.\n\nAnd I also wish to recognize Senior Vice President and Lending Officer Bill Spaniel, who will be moderating the discussion portion of this morning’s program.\n\nI’m also thankful for each of you for taking the time to join us here this morning, especially the morning after a Phillies playoff game.\n\nNow certainly, I can stand up here and speak, but that would only make this a one-way discussion. I want to hear your questions, to engage on the issues that matter to you, and to ensure we make the most of this time. So, allow me to briefly give you my economic outlook and a brief overview of current banking conditions in the Third Federal Reserve District as our launching off point for this discussion.\n\nBut before we do anything, I must get the first piece of business out of the way, and that is the usual Federal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this morning are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSo, I will begin with the following: I remain rooted in my opinion that we are at the point where holding the policy rate steady is the prudent position to take. I arrived at this decision after carefully reviewing both the hard data and what I’ve been hearing directly from contacts throughout the Third District.\n\nFurther, economic and financial conditions are continuing to evolve as I have been expecting, though I am keeping a close eye on the latest data. There has not been the abrupt shift in data that would lead me to change my current position.\n\nThe available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The latest on retail sales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it over the summer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing is that households get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the kind of drastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\n\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more cautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since the summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet to fully parse out, or we could be right at a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even stronger for households.\n\nLet me stop here to state three things. First, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices. Second, while I stand ready to revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation, I am also not going to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability in data.\n\nAnd third, we must remain data dependent, and that includes making sure we separate that which could just be noise from that which could be an actual signal. But to make that differentiation — and make it with certainty, as we must — we will need several months of data that we can average.\n\nAnd this also includes data from the impacts of lingering uncertainties to which we must remain attuned. Prolonged labor strikes, the restart of student loan payments, and international events each come with their own set of economic effects. But we won’t necessarily know their extent for some time. We will need to see the data.\n\nThe mechanics of the economy cannot be rushed. We raised the policy rate by more than 5 percentage points in the span of a little more than a year. That’s a lot of change in not a lot of time. We know that the full impacts of those increases may not yet be fully absorbed across the economy. We also turned around our balance sheet with near equal speed. We put ourselves in restrictive territory very quickly.\n\nBut the speed with which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. As I noted, policy rates are restrictive, and holding them steady now will keep us in restrictive territory and steadily pressing down on inflation. This is a time where doing nothing is doing something, and, in fact, I’d argue that it equates to doing quite a lot.\n\nSo, allow me to quickly give you my projections based on this stance.\n\nFirst, on inflation: While headline PCE inflation remains elevated above target, it is almost half of what it was last year on a year-over-year basis. And August’s monthly reading was the smallest month-over-month increase since 2020. The data I see, and all that I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is already under way and sustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\n\nI expect GDP growth, which has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But while I anticipate the rate of GDP growth to moderate, I do not anticipate a contraction. I do not project a recession.\n\nAnd looking at jobs, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above what the unemployment rate is now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5 percent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. This path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that theoretical level where labor market conditions support stable 2 percent inflation.\n\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not. There are multiple factors that can all influence unemployment rates, including technological changes in the workplace, more workers reentering the labor force, or other public policy choices that may impact workers’ decisions regarding their own jobs. And sometimes these forces simultaneously exert their push and pull.\n\nSo, when we look at all of this, my view is that we need to exhale, allow the policy actions we’ve taken to continue to work, and closely watch the data before making any decisions on moving the policy rate in either direction. A resolute, but patient, stance on monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft landing that we all wish for our economy.\n\nNow, as for when I anticipate rates coming back down? That is a question to which I don’t yet have an answer. My forecasts are based on what I know as of now. And as time goes by, as adjustments are completed, as new data emerge, and as we gain additional insight on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time frames. Suffice it to say, rates will need to stay high for a while.\n\nNow, let me briefly turn our attention to banking and financial conditions as we currently see them in the Third District. Bill and I will be able to dive more deeply into this area with you during our discussion. But here are the broad strokes.\n\nI’ll start by recognizing that, overall, current capital levels remain adequate as institutions across the District continue to have sufficient liquidity. Thankfully, banks throughout the District have not experienced widespread drop-offs in deposits, and deposit levels have been on a return upward toward historical levels. Earnings remain strong, though an increase in interest expense remains a concern.\n\nBusiness lending has continued, though it was reported to me by contacts that many borrowers have been turning their focus to their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.” The decrease in mortgage activity has been notable, as has been widely reported — and certainly this is true both here in our region and nationwide. Asset quality throughout lending portfolios has remained favorable.\n\nThirty-day delinquency rates among all active loans, while trending higher, remain below their historical and prepandemic levels.\n\nHowever, with all of this comes both interest rate and liquidity risks as deposits return to their prepandemic levels, the funding gap that it is creating, and the balance sheet impacts of the increases in policy rates.\n\nOne of the largest concerns to me, at least in the immediate Philadelphia area, remains the commercial real estate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates remain above their prepandemic levels, while office net absorption rates remain stubbornly negative. The placement of the Wanamaker Building, arguably one of this city’s premier addresses, into receivership looms large.\n\nHowever, District-wide, it has been reported through contacts that CRE portfolios aren’t necessarily facing the same risks as here in Philadelphia. As one contact relayed, the local dentist offices aren’t going to remote work. So, overall, CRE lending and loan performance remains sound.\n\nOn the operational side, we have continued to urge our contacts to remain vigilant to cyberattacks and to carefully monitor any novel tech-driven activities with which they may become engaged, including in crypto and partnerships with nonbanks to deliver financial services to customers.\n\nBut, again, throughout the District, the banking sector remains strong and not broadly impacted by the spring’s banking turmoil. Customers can have faith in their deposits and in their financial institutions.\n\nLook, overall, we continue to be in a sound region of the country. Earlier this week, at a prior event, I was asked about our region’s economic health. My response was the following: Philadelphia doesn’t seem to ride the highs or lows that other regional economies do; we seem to always just keep going.\n\nAnd that is where I would put us at this moment. Our region continues to move along. We see positive signs for our economy and our collective future.\n\nI think that’s good point for me to end. I am sure you have questions, and I am eager to get to them.",

            "content": "Good evening.\n\nThank you, Floyd, for that welcome and introduction, and my thanks to you and to Executive Director Pete Conners for putting together this evening’s program.\n\nI thank each of you as well for joining us this evening, given there is, shall we say, a competing event. I must note that this is the second time in as many weeks in which Major League Baseball did not first consult the Philadelphia Fed’s event calendar when making the Phillies’ playoff schedule. However, while I’m not particularly superstitious, when this happened last week, the Phillies won 10-2, so maybe there’s something to this after all. But just in case, I’m wearing my Phillies tie.\n\nI also congratulate you for the reason we’re all here tonight — to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the CFA Society Philadelphia. Membership in an organization such as this isn’t just a good thing to have for the networking opportunities or even for the chance to hear a Federal Reserve Bank president opine on monetary policy. It’s also good for the industry and for your clients, as it puts confidence in your commitment to them and their financial futures and in the high standards of governance espoused by the CFA Society Philadelphia.\n\nNow, speaking of monetary policy, I plan on sharing my overall thoughts and insights on the economic landscape before us — both nationally and in our region. Then, as Floyd said, we’ll get this podium out of the way and get to having a conversation where we can drill down on specific issues. And believe me, as much as I may enjoy standing up here, I much more enjoy engaging in direct conversation.\n\nBut before we can get to any of this, there is one piece of business to which I must attend, and that is the usual Federal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express this evening are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI’ve recently boiled this down to the following: Anything I say tonight is a simple matter of “Pat said,” not “The Fed said.” So, let’s use that.\n\nAs you can imagine, the thing I get asked about most — whether by the press, audiences such as yourselves, or even my friends — is interest rates.\n\nSo, let me begin by painting my picture of the economic landscape with the following broad brushstroke: Over the past several months, I have been clear in my view that, absent a stark turnabout in the data that I see and the on-the-ground testimonies of contacts that I hear, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are. And so far, economic and financial conditions are evolving roughly as I expected, though I am keeping a close eye on the latest data, which have come in a tad stronger than my baseline forecast.\n\nLet me roll back the clock a bit to 2022, when we started the pivot to a restrictive stance.\n\nIn a span of barely over a year, we not only did a lot, but we did it very fast. The policy rate went up by more than 5 percentage points, reaching its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned around our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\n\nThe speed in which we worked then is also part of my argument for holding steady now. The workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and we know there are lags, which mean that the full impacts of the higher rates may not yet be fully absorbed. I heard this very clearly from my discussions with contacts across the financial sector throughout the summer, as my viewpoint evolved to its current state.\n\nAnother part of my argument can be summarized this way: Doing nothing is doing something. And I think doing nothing at this moment equates to doing quite a lot. As long as policy rates remain restrictive, we will keep steadily pressing down on inflation and bringing markets into better balance.\n\nAnd I further believe that a resolute, but patient, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft landing that we all wish for our economy.\n\nLook at the latest data on PCE inflation — it may have remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year. Even when the volatile aspects of energy and food costs are stripped away to give us the core measure of PCE inflation that economists believe is a better harbinger of trends, we also see clear signs of progress. In fact, the August monthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\n\nNow, that said, the available data for September have mostly come out stronger than I expected. The latest on retail sales confirms that households retained spending power and did not seem shy to use it over the summer. A resilient consumer is not a problem. Indeed, perhaps the key tenet of a soft landing is that households get to adjust their plan for when and how it best serves them — as opposed to the kind of drastic, unavoidable adjustments that come with, say, suddenly losing their job.\n\nTruthfully, the momentum in consumer spending is a bit of a head-scratcher. Contacts talk of a more cautious, price-sensitive consumer. Major surveys also show a steady drop in consumer confidence since the summer. But there could have been some specific factors at play over the summer that we have yet to fully parse out, or we could be right on a turning point, or perhaps the fundamentals are even stronger for households.\n\nWe simply do not know. But we know that we do not know, and I believe that we should proceed accordingly: with caution and patience.\n\nLet me be clear, though. Certainly, we are not going to tolerate a reacceleration in prices. I stand ready to revise my views and act accordingly if I see signs of reinflation. However, I am not going to overreact to normal month-to-month variability in the data.\n\nAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\n\nAnd the data I do see, and all what I hear, point to a steady disinflation that is already under way and sustained, if slow. My projections have inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\n\nOf course, there’s much more than just the policy rate at work here. There are numerous outside factors that are working in parallel with it to further push down on inflation.\n\nFor those in this room, I don’t think I need to do much more than to point to the bond markets as a proof point. Certainly, the impacts of restrictive policy on bond prices across the yield curve are exerting their own pressures — and creating their own challenges along with it.\n\nAnd, of course, there are also the tighter overall credit conditions that have existed since the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic several months ago. In speaking with contacts over the summer, I heard that even while activity slowed, credit quality did not lag overall. Business lending continued for many, though it was reported to me that many borrowers were focusing more on financing for their “must haves,” not their “like to haves.”\n\nThere are other pressures that must be considered, too. The continued turmoil in the labor market is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on the economy — not just in the loss of overall economic activity but in the immediate impact on consumer spending as striking workers go without their usual wages.\n\nThere’s also another elephant in this room, and that is the resumption of student loan payments. Again, we do not yet know the full scope this will have on consumer spending and savings, but we know that we do not know, so I am keeping a close eye on the matter.\n\nAnd finally, we cannot forget that events around the world, and the uncertainty they bring, can have a real impact on our economy here at home. We are all watching, and in many cases praying about, the tragic situation in Israel and the Middle East, stemming from those recent terrorist attacks. And there is still Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Those are just two examples.\n\nSo, taking this all together, the picture painted is one that, I believe, shows that allowing the policy rate to remain steady is the prudent position.\n\n“Well, Pat, that’s all well and good, but when are rates going to come down,” I hear you ask.\n\nI wish I had an answer for you, but at this moment, I don’t. My forecasts are based on what I know as of now. And as time goes by, as adjustments are completed, as new data emerge, and as we gain additional insight on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them, my time frames. So, as inexact as the term “higher for longer” sounds and is, it’s the best way I have to answer that question. Rates will need to stay high for a while.\n\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way, but what I also hear from contacts and through outreach.\n\nAnd I must note that while I really do not expect it, should inflation rebound, I would not hesitate to support further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\n\nAgain, I say this with all the forecast data I have at this moment. And at this moment, I expect the economy’s overall resilience to continue. Its underpinnings remain strong.\n\nFor starters, GDP growth has been outperforming estimates from earlier this year, and I do expect GDP gains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conflate a more moderate rate of GDP growth as a contraction. I do not anticipate a recession.\n\nOn the jobs front, I anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — which is just slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5 percent, before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025.\n\nThis path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that theoretical level where labor market conditions support stable 2 percent inflation.\n\nNow, this does not mean that I expect mass layoffs. I do not.\n\nFirst, we have seen months where the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor force. I expect us to continue to have such months. And second, I have to also balance the soft data I receive from my discussions with contacts — and many have related that, given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can to hold onto them.\n\nThe economic indicators tracked by the Philadelphia Fed also give me reason to feel positive about the path forward.\n\nAmong our most closely watched indicators are the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing business outlook surveys conducted with firms throughout the Third District. The latest Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey came out this morning. Now, while firms in both of the most recent surveys noted declines in month-over-month activity, the six-month outlooks reported in each remained optimistic overall.\n\nIn addition, we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic activity: the State Coincident Indexes. And in each state in our region — Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — the overall long-range trend continues to be positive.\n\nSuch optimism is also borne out in some of the other hard data points we look at, including business formation. And here I would note, specifically, that the numbers of applications for high-propensity businesses — those expected to turn into firms with payroll — remain elevated across the board in the Third District when compared with prepandemic levels. And I also see the data showing that hotel occupancy rates, while not yet back to prepandemic levels, have continued to rebound.\n\nI do take these as promising signs.\n\nOf course, there are areas in which we have some concern. And specifically, I’ll note the commercial real estate (CRE) sector. Office vacancy rates continue to be well above their prepandemic levels. Office space net absorption rates in the Philadelphia region continue to be negative. I do have some anxiety that last month’s transition of the Wanamaker Building into receivership isn’t going to be a one-off event.\n\nAnd to be clear, to me, the issues surrounding CRE aren’t just about the investments in the buildings themselves but also about the livelihoods of the businesses — especially the small businesses — which surround them and which are simply not getting anywhere near the foot traffic they did just a few years ago.\n\nNow, I really want to step away from this podium and get to our conversation. But before we do, let me to pose the following question, which has nagged at me for months now as I’ve taken in data and formulated my position on the future direction of monetary policy: What in the economy has fundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019?\n\nIn 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic conditions. But the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\n\nAnd that’s probably a good thing. After all, I’m not a classically trained economist — by education, I’m an engineer. And if you know anything about engineers, we’re always willing to challenge previous assumptions and to look outside the box.\n\nAnd if there’s something else about engineers, we’re also really good at judging the limits of a system, and I think I’ve just about hit my limit on my prepared remarks. I am eager to get to our conversation. So, Floyd, why don’t we do away with this podium and get to it.\n\nBut one last thing: Go Phillies!",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nThank you, Susie Kendis, for that introduction and to you and your colleagues at Deloitte for yesterday’s conference, which laid significant groundwork for these next two days of discussions.\n\nI also thank our friends at Working Nation, the City of Philadelphia, and Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for helping us put together this series of events.\n\nNow, a quick reminder of the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis is an exciting event for me as it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the truly groundbreaking research going on under this roof. It may be easy to think of the Federal Reserve only in terms of monetary policy and interest rates and such — and I honestly can’t blame you — but the work we do here every day is varied, dynamic, and truly impactful as you will see.\n\nAs you may know, for nearly 50 years, the Federal Reserve has worked according to the dual mandate that Congress handed down to us. One pillar of this dual mandate is price stability. That’s the one you read about most in the news as we continue our efforts to wrestle inflation back down to our 2 percent annual target. And as an aside, we are making steady progress, but more remains to be done.\n\nThe other — equally important, if somewhat less reported — is to promote maximum employment. But what does that mean, maximum employment? Well, I look at it as a two-way proposition. It’s not just promoting economic conditions through which employers can open their doors for workers to come in. Job growth is important, but it’s not the end-all, be-all.\n\nFor me, maximum employment also means promoting a climate in which workers in those jobs are treated with respect and dignity, and where work isn’t just something to be rewarded but something that is truly rewarding. Put another way, while the quantity of available jobs is important, so, too, is the quality of those jobs.\n\nSo, it is upon the pillar of maximum employment in which we find the Worker Voices Project.\n\nYesterday, I published an article on the Philadelphia Fed’s website with my perspective on some of what the Worker Voices Project tells us. If you have not yet done so, I do encourage you to read it — just maybe not at this very moment. But allow me to give you a couple of spoilers.\n\nI opened my article with a direct quote from one of the many workers interviewed through the Worker Voices Project, who said, “I know that I can bring a lot to the table. Are you going to uphold your end of the half as an employer?”\n\nAnd I closed the article by writing the following: “I am proud that our research is being put into action toward innovations that can meet the needs of our workforce while forging the strong economy of tomorrow. And this research is not just going to benefit us as economists but, ultimately, more so as a society.”\n\nThis brings me to this event today and the further discussions that will take place tomorrow.\n\nAs economists, we have many tools and models through which we can study the forces that exert their push and pull on the labor market and those participating in it. Make no mistake, these hard data are important. Hard data give us — pun fully intended — concrete points, which, through time, we can identify employment trends, identify precursors of labor force realignments, and support potential changes in public policy.\n\nFrom what I said a moment ago, the hard data tell us a lot about the quantity of jobs.\n\nBut even for all its strengths and directional guidance, the hard data cannot tell us what is going on at the most micro level — the decisions individual workers are making about their own futures. These soft data, the data reported through the Worker Voices Project, are a critically important supplement to the hard data. Actually, strike that, it’s not a supplement; it’s a full-fledged partner. We need to look at both, equally.\n\nAnd when looking at the Worker Voices Project, I see the means for us to coalesce around basic principles that classic economics cannot capture in a model or on a chart. This is what comes to my mind when I hear the phrase “research in action.”\n\nIf you don’t know, even though I sit as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, economics wasn’t my first pursuit. By education, I’m an engineer. And if you know one thing about engineers, we cannot just let things be, when we know, deep down, systems can be made more efficient, more effective, and even more fair.\n\nThere’s nothing that an engineer enjoys more than lifting the cover and looking at what’s going on underneath. And there’s nothing that an engineer enjoys less than hearing that something can’t be changed because “that’s just the way we do things.”\n\nAnd this is what we’re doing here — we’re lifting the cover to see how we can make the labor market work more efficiently, effectively, and fairly for workers. And, over the course of the next two days, we’re not going to allow ourselves to be limited by the old ways of thinking.\n\nThat’s not being anti-employer. Far from it. As I have traveled across the Third District and talked with employers, I hear directly how hard they’re working to find the employees their businesses need to be successful — and once these employees are in, they don’t want to lose them.\n\nYet, many of these employers are sticking only to the means through which they’ve attracted workers in the past — namely, higher wages and more benefits. And not surprisingly, they are finding these tools alone aren’t as effective as they once were.\n\nThe Worker Voices Project, and the discussions and actionable research stemming from it, is a means through which we can provide these employers new and better tools to attract and retain workers. These are the workers who can see their values reflected in those held by their employer and their value rewarded not just in terms of wages but in terms of being treated with dignity.\n\nNow, I could go on as my excitement for and belief in this transformational research is nearly inexhaustible — unlike attention spans. And every minute I give back is a minute we can spend hearing from the subject experts, who are doing the research, and those living it.\n\nSo, with that, I will yield the microphone. But, again, thank you all for coming this afternoon. I hope both the rest of today’s forum and tomorrow’s working session are, like a good job, equally productive and rewarding.",

            "content": "Good morning.\n\nMy thanks to the Mortgage Bankers Association for the opportunity to be part of your annual convention and to Chair-elect Laura Escobar for that introduction.\n\nAnd, with that, welcome to the City of Philadelphia and the Third Federal Reserve District.\n\nI am honored to share this podium with my fellow speakers and to provide my outlook for economic conditions moving forward.\n\nBut before I do that, there is one piece of business to which I must attend, and that is the usual Federal Reserve disclaimer: The views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOr, if I may give the Cliffs Notes version: When recounting my remarks, please just say, “Pat said,” not “The Fed said.”\n\nLet me put it plainly: I stand here this morning fully aware of the mood in this room. And I am also fully aware of the way the actions we on the FOMC have taken over the past 18 months in our efforts to tame inflation and get it back down to our 2 percent annual target have, in their own way, contributed to the current mortgage climate.\n\nAs you know, one of the pillars of the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is price stability — getting inflation back to that 2 percent annual target. And while I am sensitive to the impacts higher policy rates have had, that goal remains job one.\n\nThroughout the summer, I traveled with my team throughout the Third District — as we do every year — to meet with community bankers and other contacts in their home communities, to talk about conditions on the ground, to hear their perspectives and concerns, and to see firsthand the impacts of monetary policy on the local level.\n\nSuffice it to say, the impact of rising mortgage rates was something that took front and center in nearly every conversation. In fact, the climate could be crystalized in seven words, which one of those contacts said to me recently: “There are no first-time home buyers.”\n\nThat’s a stark assessment. And it is one I take without further parsing. The housing market is key for our economy overall, not to mention its greater importance for our society as a whole in ensuring that every family has access to a safe and affordable place to call home.\n\nThe rise in interest rates not only raised borrowing costs on those looking to purchase a home, but it also contributed to the contraction of inventory. It is completely understandable that current homeowners won’t put their houses on the market and step away from their current low-rate mortgages.\n\nAnd it is just simple market dynamics that a lack of inventory would elevate prices overall, further lessening the depth of the pool of potential buyers.\n\nOf course, the other side of this coin is new home sales, which both the hard data show and our contacts relay are trending upward throughout this period. This, too, makes sense from the view of market dynamics — the way around contracting inventory in existing homes is to purchase a home that didn’t exist before. And we know these homes often come with attractive amenities and features an existing home may not, including being more energy efficient and decreasing the cost of keeping that home comfortable.\n\nBut, again, these sales cannot fully make up for the overall slowdown in one of the economy’s most impactful sectors.\n\nNow, I’m not going to stand here and provide a lecture on things you all know. And I am not going to minimize the work we’ve done to get inflation moving back toward target. What I want to provide you with this morning is where I see things moving forward.\n\nTo start, I remain in the place where I have found myself for the past several months: Absent a stark turn in what I see in the data and hear from contacts, and audiences like you, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are.\n\nAfter our last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and financial conditions evolve roughly as I expect, we can hold rates where they are. And, so far, economic and financial conditions are evolving as I expected, perhaps even a tad better.\n\nDisinflation is under way, labor markets are coming into better balance, and economic activity continues to be resilient.\n\nLooking back, we did a lot, and we did it very fast. In fact, I heard that summation from some of your peers throughout the summer. In barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5 percentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades. We also turned around our balance sheet policy, and we turned it around fast.\n\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some time for the full impact of the higher rates to be fully absorbed. What I have heard this summer is an appeal to give you and your customers the thing you wanted most: time to catch your breath.\n\nBut my argument is that by doing nothing, we are doing something. And I think we are doing quite a lot. Look where we are — headline PCE inflation remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year.\n\nAbout half of that drop is due to the volatile components of energy and food, so despite both of these being basic necessities of life, economists typically exclude them in the so-called core inflation rate, which gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinflation and its likely path forward.\n\nBut even that core measure of PCE inflation has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\n\nAnd again, I’m telling you something you already know, the rate of inflation in housing prices is similarly down from its peak levels.\n\nI do see a steady disinflation under way, and I expect it to continue, with inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\n\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinflation. For example, September’s CPI report came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\n\nLet me be clear about two things. First, I will not tolerate a reacceleration in prices. But second, I do not want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices.\n\nAnd for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\n\nAs long as policy rates are restrictive, we will keep steadily pressing down on inflation and bringing markets into better balance.\n\nAnd the policy rate has outside factors that are working in parallel to further push down on inflation. For example, while we are now six months past the spring banking turmoil, the tighter credit conditions that have existed since then are having the impact of higher interest rates without requiring them to be so.\n\nAdditionally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on the economy — not just in the loss of overall economic activity but in the immediate impact on consumer spending as striking auto workers, for example, are forgoing their usual wages.\n\nOn top of this, we can also add the resumption of student loan payments. Again, we do not yet know what impact this will have on consumer spending and savings, but I do expect it to be impactful, if not significant.\n\nSo, it is against this backdrop that I believe the prudent position to be in is one in which the policy rate can remain steady. Alas, you may have noticed that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high.\n\nUnfortunately, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what I know as of 10:30 a.m. on Monday, October 16, 2023.\n\nAs time goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my time frames. But, as for future policy, I can tell you I do subscribe to the moniker, “higher for longer.” I didn’t coin the phrase, but my expectation is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\n\nIt is not just the data that will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way, but what I also hear from contacts and through outreach.\n\nAfter all, my discussions over the summer helped lead me to my current position. And while I really do not expect it, if inflation were to rebound, I know I would not hesitate to support further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\n\nMeanwhile, I continue to see strong underpinnings for our economy overall. This economy is proving to be nothing if not resilient. I expect this to continue.\n\nGDP growth is outperforming estimates from earlier this year. I do expect GDP gains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But do not conflate a more moderate rate of GDP growth as a contraction. Put simply: I do not anticipate a recession.\n\nOf course, to afford a home, a family needs a job to provide the means through which to purchase it. I continue to anticipate unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5 percent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025.\n\nThis path would put the unemployment figure in line with the natural rate of unemployment, or that theoretical level where labor market conditions support stable 2 percent inflation.\n\nNow, let me be clear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoffs.\n\nThere are many factors that play into the calculation of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve had recent months in which, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor force.\n\nI also have to balance the soft data. For example, I have heard from employers — both directly and through contacts — that given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can to hold onto them.\n\nThen there are also factors that have a very persistent impact on the underlying dynamics of the economy and the labor market — technological change, immigration, child care all can shape or reshape labor markets. And some or all of these factors can be at play simultaneously.\n\nThe amount of upheaval we’ve felt in our economy in a relatively short period of time may lead some to believe that there are fundamental changes taking place. I would argue that’s only natural, given what we’ve all been through since March 2020.\n\nThe pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and an “after” in our minds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us very closely. I cannot blame anyone who says that the new normal still does not feel normal.\n\nBut let me conclude by posing the following rhetorical question: What in the economy has fundamentally changed from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that we’re going to be able to exactly replicate prepandemic economic conditions. But the resilience of this economy is making me rethink some of the classic models.\n\nI have been wrong before, and this economy is challenging us with its willingness to do what the models say it should not and cannot be able to do. But, as they say, every challenge comes with opportunity.\n\nOpportunity to look at the data in different ways. And opportunity to get out and to speak with contacts for the all-important soft data, which, so often, captures nuances that the hard data cannot.\n\nAll of this — the hard data and the soft data — must be viewed together. And when it is, I believe my position on holding the policy rate steady is the prudent one to take.\n\nI believe such a resolute, but patient, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft landing that we all wish for our economy. And with that landing, we’ll be able to see our economy take off again, but this time on a clear and stable path forward.\n\nI thank you all for the opportunity to be with you today. I wish you the very best for a productive convention.\n\nThank you.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone.\n\nI appreciate that you’re all giving up part of the end of your workday for us to be together, if only virtually.\n\nMy thanks to my good friend, Rick Mroz, for that welcome and introduction.\n\nI do believe we’re going to have a productive session. But just so you all know, as much as I enjoy speaking and providing my outlook, I enjoy a good conversation even more.\n\nSo, first, let’s take a few minutes so I can give you my perspective on where we are headed, and then I will be more than happy to take questions and hear what’s on your minds.\n\nBut before we get into any of that, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPut simply, this is one of those times where the operative words are, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\n\nNow, to begin, I’m going to first address the two topics that I get asked about most often: interest rates and inflation. And I would guess they are the topics front and center in many of your minds as well.\n\nAfter the FOMC’s last policy rate hike in July, I went on record with my view that, if economic and financial conditions evolved roughly as I expected they would, we could hold rates where they are. And I am pleased that, so far, economic and financial conditions are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even a tad better.\n\nLet’s look at the current dynamics. There is a steady, if slow, disinflation under way. Labor markets are coming into better balance. And, all the while, economic activity has remained resilient.\n\nGiven this, I remain today where I found myself after July’s meeting: Absent a stark turnabout in the data and in what I hear from contacts, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are.\n\nIn barely more than a year, we increased the policy rate by more than 5 percentage points and to its highest level in more than two decades — 11 rate hikes in a span of 12 meetings prior to September. We not only did a lot, but we did it very fast.\n\nWe also turned around our balance sheet policy — and we will continue to tighten financial conditions by shrinking the balance sheet.\n\nThe workings of the economy cannot be rushed, and it will take some time for the full impact of the higher rates to be felt. In fact, I have heard a plea from countless contacts, asking to give them some time to absorb the work we have already done.\n\nI agree with them. I am sure policy rates are restrictive, and, as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on inflation and bring markets into a better balance.\n\nHolding rates steady will let monetary policy do its work. By doing nothing, we are still doing something. And I would argue we are doing quite a lot.\n\nHeadline PCE inflation remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year. About half of that drop is due to the volatile components of energy and food that, while basic necessities, they are typically excluded by economists in the so-called core inflation rate to give a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinflation and its likely path forward.\n\nWell, core PCE inflation has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020.\n\nSo, yes, a steady disinflation is under way, and I expect it to continue. My projection is that inflation will drop below 3 percent in 2024 and level out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\n\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinflation. For example, September’s CPI report came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing.\n\nLet me be clear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reacceleration in prices. But second, I do not want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\n\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do anticipate national unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak at around 4.5 percent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call the natural rate of unemployment, or the theoretical level in which labor market conditions support stable inflation at 2 percent.\n\nNow, that said, as you know, there are many factors that play into the calculation of the unemployment rate. For instance, we’ve seen recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor force. There are many other dynamics at play, too, such as technological changes or public policy issues, like child care or immigration, which directly impact employment.\n\nAnd beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the soft data. For example, in my discussions with employers throughout the Third District, I hear that given how hard they’ve worked to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can to hold onto them.\n\nSo, to sum up the labor picture, let me say, simply, I do not expect mass layoffs.\n\nI do expect GDP gains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even as I foresee the rate of GDP growth moderating, I do not see it contracting. And, again, to put it simply, I do not anticipate a recession.\n\nLook, this economy has been nothing if not unpredictable. It has proven itself unwilling to stick to traditional modeling and seems determined to not only bend some rules in one place, but to make up its own in another. However, as frustratingly unpredictable as it has been, it continues to move along.\n\nAnd this has led me to the following thought: What has fundamentally changed in the economy from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent — both nationwide and in our respective states — while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent.\n\nNow, I’m not saying we’re going to be able to exactly replicate the prepandemic economy, but it is hard to find fundamental differences. Surely, I cannot and will not minimize the immense impacts of the pandemic on our lives and our families, nor the fact that for so many, the new normal still does not feel normal. From the cold lens of economics, I do not see underlying fundamental changes. I could also be wrong, and, trust me, that would not be the first time this economy has made me rethink some of the classic models. We just won’t know for sure until we have more data to look at over time.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are the economic uncertainties — both national and global — against which we also must contend. The ongoing auto worker strike, among other labor actions. The restart of student loan payments. The potential of a government shutdown. Fast-changing events in response to the tragic attacks against Israel. Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine. Each and every one deserves a close watch.\n\nThese are the broad economic signals we are picking up at the Philadelphia Fed, but I would note that the regional ones we follow are also pointing us forward.\n\nFirst, while in the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms in the Third District, month-over-month activity declined, the six-month outlooks for each remain optimistic for growth.\n\nAnd we also publish a monthly summary metric of economic activity, the State Coincident Indexes. In New Jersey, the index is up slightly year over year through August, which shows generally positive conditions. However, the three-month number from June through August was down, and while both payroll employment and average hours worked in manufacturing increased during that time, so did the unemployment rate — though a good part of that increase can be explained as more residents moved back into the labor force.\n\nAnd for those of you joining us from the western side of the Delaware River, Pennsylvania’s coincident index is up more than 4 percent year over year through August and 1.7 percent since June. Payroll employment was up, and the unemployment rate was down; however, the number of average hours worked in manufacturing decreased.\n\nThere are also promising signs in both states in terms of business formation. The number of applications, specifically, for high-propensity businesses — those expected to turn into firms with payroll — are remaining elevated compared with prepandemic levels. Again, a promising sign.\n\nSo, it is against this full backdrop that I have concluded that now is the time at which the policy rate can remain steady. But I can hear you ask: “How long will rates need to stay high.” Well, I simply cannot say at this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as of late 2023. As time goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my time frames.\n\nI can tell you three things about my views on future policy. First, I expect rates will need to stay high for a while.\n\nSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if inflation were to rebound, I know I would not hesitate to support further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\n\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but patient, monetary policy stance will allow us to achieve the soft landing that we all wish for our economy.\n\nBefore I conclude and turn things over to Rick to kick off our Q&A, I do want to spend a moment on a topic that he and I recently discussed, and it’s something about which I know there is generally great interest: fintech. In fact, I understand there is discussion about NACD hosting a conference on fintech.\n\nWell, last month, we at the Philadelphia Fed hosted our Seventh Annual Fintech Conference, which brought business and thought leaders together at the Bank for two days of real in-depth discussions. And I am extraordinarily proud of the fact that the Philadelphia Fed’s conference has emerged as one of the premier conferences on fintech, anywhere. Not that it’s a competition.\n\nI had the pleasure of opening this year’s conference, which always puts a focus on shifts in the fintech landscape. Much of this year’s conference centered around developments in digital currencies and crypto — and, believe me, some of the discussions were a little, shall we say, “spirited.” However, my overarching point to attendees was the following: Regardless of one’s views, whether in favor of or against such currencies, our reality requires us to move from thinking in terms of “what if” to thinking about “what next.”\n\nIn many ways, we’re beyond the stage of thinking about crypto and digital currency and into the stage of having them as reality — just as AI has moved from being the stuff of science fiction to the stuff of everyday life. What is needed now is critical thinking about what is next. And we at the Federal Reserve, both here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are focused on being part of this discussion.\n\nWe are also focused on providing not just thought leadership but actionable leadership. For example, the Fed rolled out our new FedNow instant payment service platform in July. With FedNow, we will have a more nimble and responsive banking system.\n\nTo be sure, FedNow is not the first instant payment system — other systems, whether operated by individual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some time. But by allowing banks to interact with each other quickly and efficiently to ensure one customer’s payment becomes another’s deposit, we are fulfilling our role in providing a fair and equitable payment system.\n\nAnother area where the Fed is assuming a mantle of leadership is in quantum computing, or QC, which has the potential to revolutionize security and problem-solving methodologies throughout the banking and financial services industry. But that upside also comes with a real downside risk, should other not-so-friendly actors co-opt QC for their own purposes.\n\nRight now, individual institutions and other central banks globally are expanding their own research in QC. But just as these institutions look to the Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us for technological leadership. So, I am especially proud that this System-wide effort is being led from right here at the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nI could go on and talk about fintech for much longer. After all, I’m actually an engineer more than I am an economist. But I know that Rick is interested in starting our conversation, and I am sure that many of you are ready to participate.\n\nBut one last thought on fintech — my answers today aren’t going to be generated by ChatGPT.\n\nOn that note, Rick, thanks for allowing me the time to set up our discussion, and let’s start with the Q&A.",

And as much as I enjoy providing you with my outlook, I much more enjoy the ability to drill deeper into issues through a conversation. So, let’s just get right into this.\n\nOf course, I must begin with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOr, as I’ve become fond of saying, when you’re telling your colleagues about this morning’s conversation, you can just say, “Pat said,” not “the Fed said.”\n\nNow, as you can imagine, the two topics I get asked about most are interest rates and inflation. And that makes sense, given the impact they have on the decisions made by both businesses and families. So, I’ll start there.\n\nAfter the last policy rate hike in July, I went on the record with my view that, if economic and financial conditions evolved roughly as I expected, we could hold rates where they are. And while I have been proven wrong in less than two months before, I am happy to say that so far economic and financial conditions are evolving as I expected, if not perhaps even a tad better.\n\nDisinflation is under way. Economic activity has been resilient. Labor markets are coming into better balance. Moreover, these conditions aren’t just where I see the national economy but also our regional economy and, specifically for today’s discussion, Delaware’s. And I’ll note those points in turn.\n\nSo, I remain today where I first announced myself in early August: Absent a stark turn in what I see in the data and hear from contacts, both in one-on-one conversations and in forums like this, I believe that we are at the point where we can hold rates where they are.\n\nLook, we did a lot, and we did it very fast.

I am sure policy rates are restrictive, and as long they remain so, we will steadily press down on inflation and bring markets into a better balance.\n\nBy doing nothing, we are still doing something. And, actually, we are doing quite a lot.\n\nWe are also giving ourselves a chance to navigate some of the current uncertainty — labor strikes, oil prices, and the not-fully-exorcised specter of a government shutdown included.\n\nI am more and more confident that not only is monetary policy currently working, but it will continue to work. Headline PCE inflation remained elevated in August at 3.5 percent year over year, but it is down 3 percentage points from this time last year. About half of that drop is due to the volatile components of energy and food. So, despite both of those being basic necessities of life, economists typically exclude them in the so-called core inflation rate, which gives a more accurate assessment of the pace of disinflation and its likely path forward.\n\nWell, core PCE inflation has also shown clear signs of progress, and the August monthly reading was its smallest month-over-month increase since 2020. So, yes, I do see a steady disinflation under way, and I expect it to continue, with inflation dropping below 3 percent in 2024 and leveling out at our 2 percent target thereafter.\n\nHowever, there can be challenges in assessing the trends in disinflation. For example, yesterday’s release of September’s CPI report came out modestly on the upside, driven by energy and housing. Let me be clear about two things. First, we will not tolerate a reacceleration in prices. But second, I do not want to overreact to the normal month-to-month variability of prices. And for all the fancy techniques, the best way to separate a signal from noise remains to average data over several months. Of course, to do so, you need several months of data to start with, which, in turn, demands that, yes, we remain data dependent but patient and cautious with the data.\n\nMeanwhile, I continue to see GDP growth that is outperforming estimates from earlier this year. This economy is proving to be nothing if not resilient. I do expect GDP gains to continue through the end of 2023, before pulling back slightly in 2024. But even as I foresee the rate of GDP growth moderating, I do not see it contracting. I do not anticipate a recession.\n\nIn Delaware, the signals point in the same forward direction. And, in fact, business formation in Delaware, including for high-propensity businesses, remains strong, having risen continually since the pandemic.\n\nDelaware’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic activity, increased 3.3 percent year over year according to August data, reflecting generally positive conditions. And, in fact, Delaware’s three-month increase of 0.6 percent matched the national rate of increase. In the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent business outlook surveys, which survey manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms in the Third District, including Delaware, firms overall reported declines in the current month, but their six-month outlooks are optimistic for growth.\n\nRecognizing the importance of tourism to Delaware, I do note that the number of summer overnight tourist stays captured by the Rehoboth Beach–Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce showed accommodation room counts down from last year’s high levels between Memorial Day through Labor Day. However, we know there is probably much influencing these numbers beyond inflation or other economic factors, including the weather.\n\nAll this aside, I fully recognize and appreciate these challenges that monetary policy is presenting to you and your businesses.\n\nThere are outside factors — factors that bring uncertainty with them — which continue to parallel the more restrictive stance we have pursued through the FOMC. For example, while we are now six months past the spring banking turmoil, the impact of that episode on credit markets is still being felt; this is not new to many of you.\n\nOur contacts throughout the banking sector continue to report tighter credit conditions, which essentially have the impact of higher rates without requiring them to be so.\n\nAs I have spoken with contacts throughout the Third District this summer, I have heard from across industry sectors of the challenges presented by both rates and current conditions in access to capital — from banking, to retail, to agriculture and manufacturing, and everyone in between.\n\nI know the impact the current climate is also having in the residential real estate sector, as higher mortgage rates have constricted inventory, which has, in turn, led to increasing prices and a shallowing of the pool of prospective buyers, not just in Delaware but throughout the region and nation.\n\nIn consumer finance, which I know is a particularly important sector for Delaware, there is data we follow closely. So, we do take note that while the number of open bankcard accounts is up nearly 6 percent, year over year, the rate of growth in originations is down during that same time span through June, according to the latest available data.\n\nAnd we do pay attention to the fact that outstanding balances are up more than 15 percent year over year as of August, while more consumers are pushing their payments forward, as evidenced by both the nearly 6 percent increase in the number of outstanding accounts and the increase in delinquency rates.\n\nAnd in Delaware, the 30-day delinquency rate in mortgages has been trending upward and now exceeds prepandemic levels — 2.4 percent of active loans today versus 2.2 percent in February 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the current turmoil in labor markets is likely to similarly exert downward pressure on activity. I would say this is perhaps most notable among the auto worker strike, given the enormous impact of that industry on our overall economy. It’s an industry that isn’t composed of just the direct manufacturing of cars and trucks but also the business lines of countless downstream component manufacturers and suppliers.\n\nThere is also the immediate impact of the strike on consumer spending and economic activity, as striking workers are forgoing their usual wages.\n\nIt is obviously too soon to tell the overall impact of this strike, as well as the ongoing labor action in the entertainment industry and elsewhere, on GDP or inflation, but I suspect it will become obvious in the coming months’ worth of data.\n\nAnd while an agreement was reached to temporarily keep the federal government open and running, we don’t know what will happen four weeks from now when this agreement expires.\n\nFinally, I also believe this month’s restart of student loan payments will have a further dampening effect on consumer spending. How much so, however, remains to be seen.\n\nTurning to the jobs picture, I do anticipate national unemployment to end the year at about 4 percent — just slightly above where we are now — and to increase slowly over the next year to peak around 4.5 percent before heading back toward 4 percent in 2025. That is a rate in line with what economists call the natural rate of unemployment, or the theoretical level where labor market conditions support stable inflation of 2 percent.\n\nNow, before you all post “Pat says unemployment is going up” on your social media feeds, let me be clear about one thing: This does not mean that I expect mass layoffs.\n\nThere are many factors that play into the calculation of the unemployment rate itself. For instance, we’ve had recent months where, even as the economy added more jobs, the unemployment rate increased because more workers moved off the sidelines and back into the labor force.\n\nAnd, beyond the hard data, I also have to balance the soft data. For example, employers throughout the Third District have told me that given how hard it has been to find the workers they currently have, they are doing all they can to keep them.\n\nFor Delaware, the jobs picture remains consistent: Three straight months of labor force and household job gains have brought the state’s unemployment rate closer to that of the nation than at any point in the prior two years. Jobs numbers in major sectors, including construction, finance, and professional services, are all above where they were in February 2020.\n\nI would also specifically note the nearly 9 percent year-over-year increase in jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector is back to around prepandemic levels.\n\nSurely, the pandemic was such a large health and economic crisis that it marks a “before” and “after” in our minds and lives, not the least of which was the tremendous loss of life that touched so many of us very closely. It was a shock, in every sense of the word. To so many, the new normal still does not feel normal. Again, the pandemic is likely to be a defining event for the generations that experienced it. This is true for families and businesses.\n\nBut, having said that, allow me to pose the following final thought: What has fundamentally changed in the economy from, say, 2018 or 2019? In 2018, inflation averaged 2 percent almost to the decimal point and was actually below target in 2019. Unemployment averaged below 4 percent for both years and was as low as 3.5 percent nationwide and in Delaware, while policy rates peaked below 2.5 percent. From the cold lens of economics, I do not see the fundamental changes that would call for large changes in natural rates.\n\nBut I could also be wrong, and, trust me, that would not be the first time this economy has made me rethink some of the classic models. We just won’t know for sure until we have more data to look at over time.\n\nSo, it is against this broad backdrop that I believe the prudent position is one in which the policy rate can remain steady. Alas, you may have noticed that I didn’t tell you how long rates will need to stay high. And, my apologies, I simply cannot tell you at this moment. My forecasts are based on what we know as of late 2023. As time goes by, as adjustments are completed, and as we have more data and insights on the underlying trends, I may need to adjust my forecasts, and with them my time frames.\n\nI can tell you three things on my views on future policy. First, I do subscribe to the new moniker, “higher for longer.” I didn’t coin it, but my expectation is that rates will need to stay high for a while.\n\nSecond, the data and what I hear from contacts and outreach, will signal to me when the time comes to adjust policy either way. I really do not expect it, but if inflation were to rebound, I know I would have no hesitancy to support further rate increases as our objective to return inflation to target is, simply, not negotiable.\n\nThird, I believe that a resolute, but patient, stance of monetary policy will allow us to achieve the soft landing that we all wish for our economy.\n\nAnd I think that is a good place for me to land my remarks, so we can get to have a conversation.\n\nMike, thanks for allowing me the time, and let’s start our Q&A.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this latest installment of what is quickly becoming not just one of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s premier conferences but one of the premier conferences on fintech, period.\n\nEven though this one is a home game for me, so to speak, I still must preface my remarks with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOr, as I like to put it, when you are recounting my remarks, just say, “Pat said.” Don’t say, “the Fed said.”\n\nWe have a full house here at the Philadelphia Fed, and more than 1,000 others joining us virtually. While this is only slightly fewer people than Taylor Swift and Beyoncé drew to Philadelphia, it is an incredible number that speaks to much more than the expanding interest in fintech but also to the efforts of those who put this conference together.\n\nAnd with that, I must give my thanks to Julapa Jagtiani who leads this effort. She is so much more than just a terrific introductory speaker. Julapa truly is the heart of this conference and a valuable source of information and contacts on a wide range of fintech topics, concerns, and approaches.\n\nI also wish to thank our panelists and speakers, several of whom I am proud to call my colleagues within the Federal Reserve System, along with all the organizing partners of this year’s conference. This truly is a strong team.\n\nAnd, of course, my thanks to each of you for joining us, whether in person or online.\n\nNow, this is a conference to which I always look forward to attending. After all, by education, I’m an engineer even more than I am an economist. So, any forum that stands at the nexus of these two disciplines is enough to pique my interest.\n\nAs an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a stable economy that provides opportunities for everyone to grow and succeed. As an engineer, and specifically as a civil engineer, my goal is to ensure a safe, reliable, and stable infrastructure, which provides opportunities for all communities to grow and succeed.\n\nAnd I am far from the first person to recognize this important interdisciplinary connection. In 1917, the then-director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University, John F. Hayford, wrote an essay in the Journal of Political Economy titled, fittingly enough, “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” which contains the following:\n\nIf you drill down below the surface of this statement, it becomes clear that both economists and engineers are looking for ways to make systems stronger, more equitable, and more efficient. And we can see throughout history the advances in civil engineering which brought about both economic and societal advances.\n\nWe can chart the progress from the days of siting cities within sheltered harbors or along navigable rivers and lakes, to the digging of canals and the laying of railroad tracks, which allowed for the siting of new cities; to the advent of the automobile and the airplane, which drastically shrunk distances; to the creation of the microchip, which enabled the birth of the Internet and e-commerce; and, yes, fintech, which render one’s location almost meaningless.\n\nWell, the same progress can be charted through our understanding and conceptualization of money. The barter system limited transactions to those in which two parties could come to agreement — I happen to have what you want at the moment you have what I want. The advent of cash, from cowry shells to paper notes, meant that anyone who held those commodities would be in equal standing with the next person holding the same, making markets run more efficiently and fairly.\n\nBut now our concept of money is changing. We no longer need to hold actual notes when electronic bank statements tell us how much is in our accounts and any number of instant payment apps on our smartphones allow us to move virtual money to practically anyone in any corner of the world, again, rendering our locations practically meaningless.\n\nYet, we still call a transaction made through code merely representing paper notes a cash transaction. Likewise, our e-wallets hold “credit cards” that aren’t cards at all, just graphical representations. And the development of cryptocurrencies and stablecoin is forcing us to further rethink our relationship with, and the nature and future of, cash.\n\nThese changes come in some ways for the better, and in some that should raise concerns. Everyone here recognizes that fintech presents not just opportunities but also challenges, and that we will not ultimately succeed if we only focus on the former and ignore the latter.\n\nSo, how do we view these innovations? How do we ensure adequate understanding of their risks and benefits? And how should public policy and regulation address these as they pose both benefits and risks to consumers and the economy at large?\n\nThese are just a few of the questions swirling around the topic of fintech, which bring us to today and this conference.\n\nBut the biggest question of all is not “what if” but “what next”? This is the big question that will be in the background of every conversation over these two days. And my hope is that these conversations will keep us moving toward the answer.\n\nWe are witnessing a technological revolution through AI, which holds tremendous promise for increasing productivity and allowing for more decisions to be made in real time.\n\nAs an increasing number of institutions turn to AI-powered chatbots, the need for us to continue fine-tuning and securing this technology only increases. A recent story2  in the New York Times highlighted a Las Vegas conference at which white-hat hackers were asked to help uncover vulnerabilities in the safeguards of AI chatbots. And many found ways to trick these chatbots into making misleading, unethical, and potentially dangerous statements.\n\nIt’s not hard to move from this situation to one of malicious hackers exposing security flaws to exploit unsuspecting customers at a financial institution into giving up sensitive identifying information. This is an instance where our ability to keep focused on what may be next will also ensure consumer confidence.\n\nAnd we at the Federal Reserve, both here in Philadelphia and System-wide, are going to remain focused on doing our part. For example, July saw the rollout of the new FedNow instant payment service platform. With FedNow, we will have a more nimble and responsive banking system. Within the Third District, we continue working with our banking partners to encourage their participation.\n\nCertainly, the Federal Reserve is not first past the post in creating an instant payment system — other systems, whether operated by individual banks or through third parties, have been operational for some time. But by allowing banks to interact with each other to ensure one customer’s payment quickly and efficiently becomes another’s deposit, the Federal Reserve is fulfilling its role to provide a fair and equitable payment system.\n\nAnother area where the Fed is providing thought leadership is in quantum computing, or QC. And I am especially proud that this System-wide effort is being led from right here at the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to revolutionize security and problem-solving methodologies throughout the banking and financial services industry. Right now, individual institutions and other central banks globally are expanding their own research into QC. And just as these institutions look to the Fed for economic leadership, so, too, are they looking to us for technological leadership.\n\nQC holds tremendous promise for expanding capabilities far beyond those that our current systems allow. But we also know QC could allow for nefarious actors to pose a truly global cybersecurity threat — such as by hacking encryption algorithms. And while there is noted progress in quantum-resilient encryption, as a banking regulator, ever-present technological change means we cannot take our eyes off the ball.\n\nThese examples are why the Fed will also continue its efforts to provide leadership in the areas of financial literacy and education — including the publications and materials we have made available for educators to take into their classrooms — to give consumers the tools they will need to navigate these new waters, make smart decisions, and protect their own futures.\n\nThankfully, we are not alone in any of these efforts. Throughout the financial system are numerous partners — public and private sector alike, inside this room and watching online — who understand the importance of making sure we get the correct answer to the question, “what next?”\n\nAnd, as it just so happens, one of these partners is the subject of our first Fireside Chat — Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).\n\nThroughout his tenure leading the CFPB, and before it as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, Director Chopra has focused on issues of fraud prevention and economic and financial fairness.\n\nI am also honored to welcome him as he happens to be an alum of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which is not only one of our conference’s organizing partners, but where I also hung my hat as dean for many years in my prior life in academia.\n\nAnd leading the discussion will be the director of the Digital Assets Policy Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, Tim Massad.\n\nIn addition to authoring numerous articles on crypto and financial regulation, Tim served as chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission — a tenure that brought him front and center with numerous fintech issues — and as assistant secretary for Financial Stability at the United States Treasury.\n\nWith that, it’s time to get this seventh Fintech Conference formally started.\n\nSo, what next?\n\nWell, at this microphone, it’s the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra.",

            "content": "Thank you very much, Tameshia, for leading that enlightening discussion, and thank you to Rebecca, David, and Johnny for sharing your stories and insights.\n\nAnd, of course, thank you to Fed Communities and my colleagues from throughout the System — including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who we heard from earlier — for their partnership in the Worker Voices Project.\n\nTo be sure, we’re at a watershed moment in our economy. I’m not just talking about the fight against inflation, in which we’re making progress.\n\nIt is a watershed moment in the labor market as well, especially for those of us who look at data and try to interpret their meaning. But numbers have two inherent problems. First, the numbers we get are always backward looking, a snapshot from an earlier time. Second, the numbers blur the faces and voices of those they seek to capture; they can only tell us so much.\n\nThis is where discussions like this and, more specifically, efforts like the Worker Voices Project are so essential. For our economy at this moment, it is important for those of us who hold a responsibility for promoting full employment and fostering economic opportunity to know, in real time, why workers are making the decisions they are, especially workers either employed in low-wage positions or who do not have a college degree.\n\nAnd I also would suggest there are important messages that employers would be wise to heed concerning the kind of workplace they may need to create to attract the workforce they will need to be successful.\n\nBy education, I’m a civil engineer, even more than an economist. If you know anything about civil engineers, we’re always looking for ways to make things stronger, better, and more resilient. For me, this includes our economy.\n\nAs we have heard from today’s discussion, the factors going into the decisions made by workers of where to work, when to work, or whether to leave the work they have previously known to blaze an entirely new path — like David has — are increasingly complex. And we oversimplify these complexities at our own peril, whether as policymakers or employers.\n\nCertainly, the pandemic did not create these complexities. As long as there has been work, workers have made decisions about their place and role in the economy, based on a number of factors. And workers today have more choices before them. The pandemic served as a breaking point for all of these stresses — at few other times in history have so many seemingly come to the same conclusions about their own future in the workforce.\n\nThey want to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nThey want to the opportunity to gain new skills that will provide them with upward mobility.\n\nThey don’t want a job that doesn’t just get them through the day, but the opportunity to create a satisfying and high-quality career.\n\nThey want managers who recognize that they, like them, have families and dreams outside of work and strive to ensure an appropriate work–life balance.\n\nThe expectation of workers is that they will be treated as individuals. And this is especially true for workers in jobs at the lower ranges of the wage scale or those without degrees. Jobs are not one-size-fits-all, and neither are workers. Hiring processes may be more automated, but no worker wants to be treated like an automaton.\n\nAnd the Worker Voices Project is providing the data that put this reality into greater focus and perspective.\n\nAs a result, many of us who have studied economics are having to rethink some of the premises we had previously relied upon. But that’s probably a good thing. Despite what many of us were taught in Econ 101, the study of economics is not all straight lines and straightforward conclusions. Sometimes the economy, and those contributing to it, not only bend long-established rules but contribute to the creation of new ones in the process.\n\nWe appear to be at that kind of moment now, and the research in the Worker Voices Project is contributing to this new way of thinking. Which is good, because if one thing is now crystal clear, it is that workers no longer want to be treated merely as a plot point on a graph.\n\nFor us as policymakers, the soft data provided by Worker Voices are equally important as, if not perhaps even more important than, numbers-driven hard data in getting a full understanding of our economic situation.\n\nI am excited not just about this report, but for the research that is going to grow out of it. The more we can bring the examples outlined in the Worker Voices report into our way of thinking, the better our chances of creating a strong, growing, and more inclusive American economy.\n\nSo, when I hear someone utter the apocryphal question, “Why doesn’t anyone want to work anymore?” my response is to ask in return, “What are you doing in your workplace to make them want to work for you?” and to point them to the Worker Voices Project.\n\nAgain, I thank our panelists and everyone who contributed to today’s webinar. And I thank all of you watching for spending part of your afternoon with us.\n\nWhitney, I’ll now hand the program back to you.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Sandy, for that welcome and introduction.\n\nMy thanks to the Philadelphia Business Journal for bringing us together, and I must give recognition in absentia to Editor-in-Chief Ryan Sharrow for reaching out and inviting me to be with you.\n\nI also must give thanks to City Winery for hosting us this morning. I do note with some disappointment that it is only 8:00 a.m., and we’re at a winery. I know while technically it may be 5:00 somewhere, this may be a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnd I also thank you all for coming out this morning. It is always a pleasure to not only see so many familiar faces but also to get to know new ones.\n\nAnd no matter whether we are meeting today for the first time or just the latest of many, what excites me is that we’re all here for the same key reason. We care about Philadelphia. With its diversity of peoples and opportunities, Philadelphia remains an economic driver and leader.\n\nSo, I am happy to be here to give you my sense of where we are and where I see us heading, as well as to highlight a few things we have going on down Arch Street at the Philadelphia Fed, which you may find of interest.\n\nBefore I go any further, allow me to get a piece of business out of the way at the outset — and that’s the regular Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOr, in simple English, you can always say, “Pat said.” You just can’t say, “the Fed said.”\n\nNow, this year I sit as a voting member of the FOMC. At our meeting two weeks ago, I joined my colleagues on the Committee in voting to raise the policy rate another 25 basis points, to a range of 5¼ to 5½ percent — the 11th policy rate increase in the span of 12 meetings. But you knew that. I bet what you want to know is what we are going to do next. Unfortunately, I do not know — it depends on what the data will tell us from now to our next meeting in September.\n\nWhat I can tell you is where we stand now given past actions, what I expect to see in the data going forward, and whether I believe that we need to do more, or not.\n\nTen days ago, the latest PCE inflation report showed continued disinflation year over year on the headline measure and promise on the core measure. We are making progress against inflation. It has been slow progress, and I am watchful of any reemerging price pressures. We remain unwavering in our commitment to bring inflation back to target.\n\nAnd this is indeed what I expect will happen. I expect core PCE inflation to decline to a rate perhaps just below 4 percent year over year by the end of 2023, before falling below 3 percent next year and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025.\n\nWhile this economy may not be hewing to traditional modeling and seems to bend some rules in one place and make up its own in another, it continues to move along. I forecast unemployment to tick up slightly and better align with the natural unemployment rate as labor tightness continues to ease. And when it comes to GDP, I expect the rate of growth to be slightly lower than what we have seen so far this year.\n\nIn sum, I expect only a modest slowdown in economic activity to go along with a slow but sure disinflation. In other words, I do see us on the flight path to the soft landing we all hope for and that has proved quite elusive in the past.\n\nNow that you know what I expect, I can tell you what I believe: Absent any alarming new data between now and mid-September, I believe we may be at the point where we can be patient and hold rates steady and let the monetary policy actions we have taken do their work.\n\nI take my role seriously in achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. And I remain focused on seeing us achieve these goals to support our long-term economic success.\n\nAllow me to be clear about one thing, however. Should we be at that point where we can hold steady, we will need to be there for a while. The pandemic taught us to never say never, but I do not foresee any likely circumstance for an immediate easing of the policy rate.\n\nBefore the Committee meets again, we will have a slew of new economic data to consider, with another PCE report, one more employment report, and two CPI reports among them. And I will continue to talk and listen to people from throughout the Third District. Together, these will provide the guidance I will need in considering my ultimate stance heading into September’s Committee meeting.\n\nThis slew of data is not just national in scope. I also closely consider what I see going on right here in the Philadelphia region. So, allow me to take a couple of minutes to share with you my more localized view.\n\nOverall, the area’s economy reflects weakened conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but maintains strengths, particularly in the labor market. While survey responses from both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing businesses reflect currently weakened business activity across the region, responses have moved positive for future expectations. Inflationary pressures in the region have also waned somewhat though — as it is across the nation — inflation generally remains above target and wage pressures remain elevated.\n\nThat’s the snapshot. But let’s look a little deeper.\n\nPennsylvania’s Coincident Index, the Philadelphia Fed’s summary metric of economic activity, increased 1.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.6 percent from May to June, reflecting positive conditions. There was a rise in payroll employment, the unemployment rate fell during the three-month period, and there was an increase in average hours worked in manufacturing. Overall, year to year, the index has risen 3.6 percent.\n\nAnother positive indicator is business formation, which in Pennsylvania continues well above prepandemic levels, with more than 12,500 business applications as of June 2023, compared with roughly 8,600 in February 2020, seasonally adjusted.\n\nOn the jobs front, the Philadelphia MSA has not only fully recovered its pandemic-era losses but is currently running 96,000 jobs above February 2020. Notably, this includes the hospitality sector, which is at full recovery.\n\nAnd, speaking of hospitality, we know that restaurants and hotels are good indicators of consumer spending and local economic health. One of the data sets we look at in the Philadelphia Fed is the trend data for seated diners, which currently shows restaurant activity more than 4.5 percent above this time last year.\n\nThe hotel sector, however, remains slightly below where it was prepandemic, despite Taylor Swift’s best efforts.\n\nWhen it comes to housing, Philadelphia Fed researchers also recently looked at current, real-time asking rents region-wide. Like many areas of the country over the past three years, Philadelphia experienced significant rent inflation, but the data now show that tapering off, as asking rents on average slightly decreased 0.14 percent from April to May and basically have not changed across a three-month span.\n\nLooking at residential sales, current market tightness continues. As mortgage rates have risen, it is understandable that current homeowners don’t want to put their houses on the market and step away from their current low-rate mortgages, diminishing inventory. And, certainly, a lack of inventory keeps prices elevated, which further impacts the depth of the potential- buyer pool. Both are understandable outcomes.\n\nI am also very sensitive to the state of the commercial real estate sector, especially here in Center City. And I am glad that part of the discussion that will follow me will be specifically dedicated to CRE.\n\nFirst, I recognize the potential impact on financial institutions heavily invested in CRE, should they get pressed into ownership in the event of a loan default. But on a more street level, I have concerns about the health of the businesses traditionally supported by now-remote workers or those only in their offices intermittently, especially in the restaurant and services industries.\n\nAs the Philadelphia Business Journal itself reported just a few weeks ago, it will take many months, perhaps a couple of years, for the commercial real estate market to shake itself out and rightsize, given the shifts in working environments. We will be watching this carefully, I assure you.\n\nLooking ahead, I am also focused, as many are, on the potential impact of the October 1 resumption of federal student loan payments. Even with new income-based payment plans set to reduce payments for many borrowers, our contacts have expressed concern about their capacity to reintegrate these borrowers into the repayment system.\n\nSo, how this system is implemented, and how prepared borrowers are and where their repayment funds will come from — whether from paychecks or savings — will be something we will be keeping a close eye on.\n\nAs we’ve been tracking, credit card balances and loan delinquency rates have both been increasing in recent months. Coinciding with this has been a decrease in bank balances, as consumers have drawn more from their savings to pay their bills, even if this drawdown is of pandemic-era supports they’ve held on to. This is not the ideal consumer finance backdrop in which one would necessarily want to add potentially hundreds of dollars in new monthly student loan payments.\n\nBut, overall, I believe that the resilience we’ve seen in our economy will continue, and I do believe we are poised to come out from under the pressure of inflation in good condition, both nationally and right here in Philadelphia and the region.\n\nBut what the economy on the other side will look like is not set in stone and is something that we at the Philadelphia Fed are working hard to help decipher. So, please allow me a couple of minutes to highlight two ongoing initiatives: the Anchor Economy Initiative and the Worker Voices Project.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed established the Anchor Economy Initiative to dive deep into the economic impacts that hospitals and institutions of higher education have on their home regions. While it’s long been assumed that there’s been a positive benefit, we lacked the data to capture the economic impacts of “eds and meds.”\n\nOver the course of a year, the team at the Philadelphia Fed pulled together data from all 524 regions of the United States to create the Anchor Economy Dashboard, which measures the direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts these institutions have on their communities.\n\nThe dashboard also includes a reliance index to indicate how dependent a region is on higher eds and hospitals for economic activity. With 1 as a baseline average, Philadelphia came in at an index of 1.4.\n\nWhile an increased reliance on eds and meds can be a concern in places where institutions are vulnerable from challenges in health care and declining college enrollments, in Philadelphia, our eds and meds are more likely a strength. In fact, if you break down the data, these anchor institutions support nearly 496,000 jobs and nearly $34 billion in employment income and benefits up and down the chain. Further, they add more than $51 billion to our regional GDP — roughly 11.4 percent of the region’s total. Moreover, each job created in the anchor economy has a multiplier effect of creating roughly one other job elsewhere in our area.\n\nUltimately, the power of having data is the power to make positive change in communities. The dashboard is a tool for communities to use in their economic development planning. For instance, St. Louis and Chicago are both using the regional data as context for some deeper dives they’re doing on impacts at the neighborhood level. And, here in Philadelphia, I recently sat down with institutional leaders to begin discussions of how we may all be able to augment each other’s efforts.\n\nThe basic recognition is that each institution comes with its own sets of priorities, opportunities, and challenges. But if we pull back the layers, we’ll find the points from which collective strengths can be leveraged and strong partnerships can emerge for an even larger impact.\n\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative is just getting started, so there will be much more to report as time goes on.\n\nThe Worker Voices Project is a more than year-long partnership between our colleagues at the Atlanta Fed — and other Fed Banks — focused on meeting with and listening to workers in low-wage jobs and those with a college degree to understand more fully what truly matters to them when deciding where, when, and whether to work, especially in this post-pandemic job market.\n\nI know we’ve all heard — and some have maybe even said — the phrase, “No one wants to work anymore.” But that’s an overly simplistic view. What we’ve learned is that there are a multitude of reasons why a worker may have exited the labor market at the onset of the pandemic only to reenter from an entirely different door on the other side of it or quit jobs at such a high rate.\n\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only about wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees, but not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\n\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something for which economists don’t yet have a metric: to be treated with dignity.\n\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction, are increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about labor markets.\n\nAllow me to provide two examples from earlier this summer, when I had the opportunity at the Philadelphia Fed to engage with workers as part of the Worker Voices Project. One young woman, a single working mother, told me that she changed jobs because she needed a manager who understood how last-minute schedule changes impacted her ability to find childcare. And we heard from a young man who left a job that required him to be on the road; yet, when diagnosed with a condition that left him prone to severe seizures, his manager still wanted him spending his days driving, as opposed to similar work that could be done from a stationary location.\n\nAs one participant summed it up, “We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\n\nFor us as policymakers and employers, those words can point us in the direction for creating a strong, growing, and more inclusive economy.\n\nWhich, after all, is what we all want and is the reason why we’re all here today. We at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are just as committed to the economic health of our region and our residents as you are. And we remain at the ready with the data and insights necessary to help you make the decisions that will lead to your success.\n\nWith all that said — and I know it’s a lot — I’d be happy to step back and take some questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you in this series on monetary policy and our economic outlook.\n\nAnd I thank NABE for the invite and Dr. Elaine Buckberg for moderating.\n\nYou heard from my colleague, Richmond Fed President and CEO Tom Barkin, on Tuesday, so I am honored to provide a Fed bookend to this webinar.\n\nI look forward to having a useful and engaging dialogue. But please allow me to open with my thoughts on the direction in which we are heading.\n\nAnd I must lead with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still running at over 4 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent annually. Disinflation is under way, but it is doing so at a disappointingly slow pace.\n\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for American families — cutting into purchasing power and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally.\n\nThe toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated costs of housing, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\n\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring demand more in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our primary monetary policy tool — by 500 basis points since March 2022. Ongoing balance sheet reduction is also tightening financial conditions.\n\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working; for example, house price indexes are cooling.\n\nAnd it is encouraging that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains relatively healthy overall. Since January, we’ve experienced modest growth in economic activity.\n\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs created, on net, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is beginning to ease a bit, the unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.4 percent in April.\n\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system. The recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic ignited an understandable wave of anxiety among banks, depositors, and investors. But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\n\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks. That’s why the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy and its banking interests. The Federal Reserve also led a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank so we could learn what went wrong.\n\nSo, of course, I know the question on everyone’s mind: OK, Pat, where do we go from here?\n\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full employment and price stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at full employment. But when it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\n\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and inflation. I expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow economic activity and hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to return inflation to its 2 percent target. To do this, the policy stance needs to be restrictive enough — but what is “enough” is not written in stone somewhere.\n\nInstead, I am closely monitoring incoming data, listening to our contacts and audiences, and evaluating economic conditions to assess whether additional tightening will be needed.\n\nI do believe that we are close to the point where we can hold rates in place and let monetary policy do its work to bring inflation back to the target in a timely manner.\n\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit below 1 percent.\n\nI expect inflation to decline to somewhere around 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in 2024, and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly, hitting around 4.4 percent this year.\n\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very uncertain environment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators and assessing their implications.\n\nNow, as I’ve said before, survey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we look at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like restaurant reservations and mobility data.\n\nThese data — hard data — tell us a lot. But even hard data have their limits. The numbers can point in a certain direction, yet there may be a lot going on underneath those numbers, which is not as easily visible but is just as vital to drawing a complete picture.\n\nTake, for example, the employment picture.\n\nThroughout the past year, each interest rate hike was predictably followed by voices warning that we were about to tank the labor market and spike unemployment. That hasn’t happened, but we monitor these trends to see how workers will be impacted if it does.\n\nGiven the tight labor market, there’s obviously something deeper happening. We continually hear from some employers that certain tools aren’t working as they once did. Simply offering higher wages still isn’t attracting the workers some need, and some efforts to increase the productivity of current workers is instead leading to increased turnover.\n\nThese cases are especially true at the lower end of the wage scale, and this may be why some have groused that, “No one wants to work anymore.” But I think we all would agree there’s more going on under the surface.\n\nNow, I’m not strictly an economist. I’m a civil engineer. And that background is what is forcing me to look at this issue in a different way.\n\nAnd this is what we at the Philadelphia Fed are doing. And I’d like to spend a few moments on this before we get to our Q&A.\n\nOver the past year, our Community Development and Regional Outreach team, along with colleagues at the Atlanta Fed and elsewhere, engaged with low-wage and non-degree-holding workers nationwide in a series of focus group conversations.\n\nWe’ve been listening to them and to their reasons why they may have exited the labor market at the onset of the pandemic to reenter from an entirely different door on the other side of it or are quitting jobs at such a high rate.\n\nWe’re calling this effort the Worker Voices Project. And we released our first report — “Shifting Perspectives and Expectations on Employment” — one week ago.\n\nYes, workers want to be paid what they believe they are worth and bring to the table, but it’s not only about wages. And, yes, they want to be somewhere they can be productive and contributing employees, but not if they don’t believe their contributions are appreciated, let alone rewarded.\n\nWhat we increasingly heard is that workers want something that we, as economists and civil engineers, don’t yet have a metric for: being treated with dignity.\n\nAs one participant told me recently, “Work is not the end-all, be-all.” Or, in the words of another, “We’re looking for a place where we belong.”\n\nThe factors going into the decisions of where to work, or whether to go in an entirely different direction, are increasingly complex. And these complexities may make us rethink what we thought we knew about labor markets.\n\nI encourage everyone to take a look at our initial Worker Voices Project report.\n\nFor us as policymakers, soft data are perhaps equally important to get a full understanding of our economic situation. And the soft data we’re getting through Worker Voices are what will help us chart a course for a strong and growing — but also a more inclusive — American economy.\n\nI know that’s a lot to start with, but I also know it’s what is going to lead us to a great conversation.\n\nAnd, Elaine, to that end, let’s get right to it.",

            "content": "Good evening, everyone! Any time I get to spend with the Wharton family is time well spent, and this is certainly no exception. Thank you for the invitation to join you tonight.\n\nWith the economy and the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I thought we should spend our time together covering a few topics of interest. First, I’ll talk about current economic conditions and how they are affecting the Fed’s monetary policy actions. Then, I’ll take a deep dive into the effects that monetary policy can have on the housing market and how these impacts transmit through the economy. After that, I plan to leave plenty of time at the end for your questions and comments.\n\nBut before I do any of that, I have to issue the standard disclaimer: The views I express tonight are my own and don’t necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way… let’s talk about the state of the economy. In the wake of the pandemic, one word has remained top of mind for the Federal Reserve: inflation.\n\nWhile headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year, it is still running at 5 percent year over year — way above the Fed’s long-run target of 2 percent annually. Recent readings show that inflation is continuing to recede, but it’s doing so slowly.\n\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing power and household wealth. And the pain isn’t being felt equally. The toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the elevated costs of shelter, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\n\nTo combat this inflation, the Fed has been working to slow the economy modestly and bring it more in line with supply. We have increased the target range for the federal funds rate — our primary monetary policy tool — by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction is another way to tighten conditions.\n\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house price indexes are cooling.\n\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we have raised rates, the national economy remains relatively healthy overall. Since January, we’ve experienced strong growth in economic activity.\n\nThere are also still a record number of Americans employed, with more than 1 million jobs created, on net, so far this year. While there are some signs that labor market tightness is beginning to ease a bit, the unemployment rate remains near record lows — 3.5 percent in March.\n\nWe’re also paying close attention to the banking system.

But I can assure you that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient.\n\nWe know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks. That’s why the Treasury, FDIC, and the Fed acted quickly to protect the U.S. economy and its banking interests. The Federal Reserve is also leading a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank so that we can learn what went wrong.\n\nTaking all of this into account, here’s my outlook for what you should expect from the Federal Reserve and the economy in the near term.\n\nThe Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our dual mandate: to promote full employment and price stability. On the jobs front, things look quite good; we are, effectively, at full employment. But when it comes to inflation, there is still significant room for improvement.\n\nIt will take some time to evaluate how recent events may impact overall economic activity and inflation. I expect to see tighter credit conditions for households and businesses that may slow economic activity and hiring, but the full extent is still unclear.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Fed remains fully committed to its 2 percent inflation target. To achieve that, I anticipate that some additional tightening may be needed to ensure policy is restrictive enough to support both pillars of our dual mandate. Once we reach that point, which should happen this year, I expect that we will hold rates in place and let monetary policy do its work.\n\nAlong this path, I project that we will see modest growth this year, with real GDP coming in a bit below 1 percent. I expect inflation to continue declining, landing somewhere between 3 percent and 3.5 percent this year, before falling to 2.5 percent in 2024, and leveling out at our 2 percent target in 2025. Unemployment is also likely to tick up slightly, hitting around 4.4 percent this year.\n\nBut this is just a snapshot of what conditions look like today. We’re operating in a very uncertain environment, and I will be closely monitoring our dashboards of economic indicators and assessing their implications.\n\nI often get asked how the Fed measures the impact of its monetary policy decisions. Unfortunately, there’s no simple answer.\n\nMonetary policy has both immediate and lagging impacts, which affect sectors of the economy in different — and often interconnected — ways. To make better sense of it, economists sort these impacts into “channels.”\n\nBut even within a channel, it can be difficult to get a clear picture of how monetary policy is transmitting — something we can see by taking a closer look at one of our most studied and well-known channels.\n\nAfter just about every FOMC meeting, you’ll see some version of the same headline pop up: “What does the Fed’s decision mean for home buyers?”\n\nSo, let’s focus our conversation there: on the housing channel. How do the Fed’s actions impact home buyers?\n\nAs you all know, the Fed doesn’t actually set mortgage rates. Our primary tool for conducting monetary policy, as I mentioned, is the target range for the federal funds rate. But there is a close relationship between this rate and the mortgage rates that are offered to consumers.\n\nFederal funds transactions are unsecured overnight loans, typically used by depository institutions to lend or borrow reserves. Of course, this isn’t how people finance home purchases. They take out mortgages that are collateralized and spread out over multiple years, if not decades.\n\nMortgage lenders take this into account when setting interest rates. They’re not only looking at what the federal funds rate is today, but what they expect it to be 10 or more years down the line. They’re also considering a whole host of broader macroeconomic factors.\n\nYet there is a clear and fast pass-through from the federal funds rate to mortgage rates. For example, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage could be found for as low as 2.7 percent at the end of 2020, when our policy rate was effectively at zero. In the last 12 months, that same 30-year fixed rate mortgage has climbed to nearly 7 percent, with policy rates now close to 5 percent.\n\nNow, you might think this means that home buyers are the first stakeholders within the housing channel to be impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy actions. But when rates are falling, there’s another group that can feel it even sooner — and there isn’t even a real estate transaction involved.\n\nMortgage refinancing is a big business — if interest rates are going down. In fact, when the FOMC cut the federal funds rate to zero in response to the pandemic, refinancing rose to a staggering $2.6 trillion in 2020 and 2021 — more than double the prepandemic value.\n\nAs homeowners refinanced their mortgages into lower-interest loans, it freed up monthly income, boosting household consumption and savings. This, in turn, helped the economy better weather the uncertainty caused by the pandemic — one of the FOMC’s objectives for cutting rates at the time.\n\nThe situation looks quite different today. When mortgage rates increase, there’s little incentive to refinance — and we see this show up in recent data. Refinancing fell to $66 billion in the last quarter of 2022. Other instruments that let owners tap into their home equity, like home equity lines of credit, have become more expensive as well.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that refinancing is history dependent when it comes to the potential impact of monetary policy.1 What rates have been, and for how long, directly affect how much refinancing will be triggered by accommodative monetary policy. With most mortgages today locked in at very low rates, even bringing the federal funds rate all the way back to zero would be unlikely to trigger much meaningful refinancing.\n\nNow, let’s turn to our next group of stakeholders impacted by the Fed’s monetary policy decisions: home buyers and sellers.\n\nHere, it’s time to state the obvious. A higher federal funds rate almost always leads to higher mortgage rates, which makes buying a house more expensive for prospective homeowners.\n\nHigher costs typically dampen demand on both sides of a potential transaction. Home buyers may choose to wait for lower prices or lower rates to make a purchase. Homeowners, meanwhile, may postpone selling to preserve a locked low-interest rate or wait for a higher price. As home sales slow, house prices should eventually decrease, though this usually happens with a lag.\n\nAfter a year of interest rate increases, we have started to see this process play out in the current housing market. After sales of existing homes exceeded 6 million in 2021, we saw sales during the last quarter of 2022 average 4 million at an annual rate. Sales of new homes were also halved from their peak. Meanwhile, house prices have fallen each month since their peak in June, though they remain at similar levels to what we saw a year ago.\n\nA drop in house prices can have notable effects within the broader economy. During the Great Recession, we saw a pronounced decrease in household consumption tied to declining home prices. More recent research has emphasized liquidity effects, which can play an important role in determining the strength and timing of monetary policy transmission in the housing channel. Ronel Elul, from the Philadelphia Fed, and coauthors argue that once all credit constraints that households face are accounted for, there are negligible wealth effects.\n\nAs we look at the current situation, U.S. households have entered the tightening cycle with very healthy balance sheets. Existing homeowners are also benefiting from low mortgage rates and elevated home equity. This gives a “cushion” for homeowners, making it unlikely that a correction in house prices would trigger widespread liquidity constraints and consumer spending reductions.\n\nIt’s also important to point out that there will never be a perfect relationship between interest rates and home-buying trends. The purchase of a home is often associated with other major life events, like getting married. This means that a certain level of housing demand will always be present, regardless of mortgage rates or house prices.\n\nThat brings us to our next group of stakeholders who will be most impacted by changes to monetary policy: renters and landlords.\n\nThe rental market is where we start to see lags pile up as conflicting dynamics play out. As potential home buyers delay purchases because of higher rates, rental demand can increase, incentivizing landlords to raise rents.2 But their ability to do so immediately can be limited by leasing terms that range anywhere from six to 24 months. Landlords may also hesitate to raise rents on existing tenants in good standing, who may balk at significant increases and leave units empty for months. Striking the right balance is a juggling act.\n\nWhat’s the end result from a monetary policy perspective? A very protracted and muted effect on renters — who, we can’t forget, make up about a third of total U.S. households.\n\nThe impacts only get fainter as we branch out beyond the rental market and into a world many of you know well: the supply side. Both builders and investors in the housing channel also respond to monetary policy actions, but long project lead times mean the lags here are substantial. They’re also more likely to be closely interrelated with other channels, like the cost of goods.\n\nWhere are we today? Housing starts have been slowing down compared with a year ago, but they remain well above their average levels since the Great Recession and prior to the pandemic. Starts for multiunit structures, which have even longer building lags, have yet to abate.\n\nUp to this point, we have explored how monetary policy impacts the housing market. But the Fed’s dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability overall. So, the next question becomes: How much does housing matter for total employment and aggregate inflation?\n\nFor employment, the answer is: not too much. Employment in construction represents just about 5 percent of total nonfarm payrolls, and only a fraction works with residential buildings. Lags here confound the picture quite a bit. While employment in construction is still growing slightly year over year, declining residential investment has subtracted more than 1 percentage point of GDP growth in the second half of last year.\n\nBut when it comes to inflation, housing matters. Home prices and rents are also major drivers of inflation. Housing makes up about a third of the basket of goods used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Yet, even as home prices have fallen, shelter inflation has steadily increased. In fact, more than 60 percent of the increase in the most recent core CPI can be attributed to rising shelter costs.\n\nNow, I have mainly talked about housing through the narrow lens of monetary policy. But I’d be remiss if I also didn’t touch on the structural factors impacting housing — most notably, the lack of affordable housing.\n\nSince the Great Recession, the U.S. hasn’t built enough housing to keep price growth in check. By most estimates, we are now several million homes short of where we need to be. This is a primary driver of shelter inflation, which, as we discussed, is one of the key reasons core inflation remains so high.\n\nGetting shelter inflation under control is an urgent priority. Monetary policy has a role to play here in broadly fighting inflation, bringing down the costs of goods and services related to the housing channel. But to fully address the scope and scale of this problem, we also need action from federal, state, and local governments.\n\nWhat could this look like? Some of the ideas I’ve seen mentioned include changing zoning laws, revising tax codes, building workforce housing, and creating housing subsidies.\n\nAs a Fed president, I’m neutral on the merits of any specific policy; that’s for other policymakers to decide. But I’m not neutral on the need to do something.\n\nShelter inflation is a macroeconomic drag. Money spent on housing is money that’s not being spent on education, services, and durable goods.\n\nThere are also already signs that our most vibrant metro areas aren’t achieving their full economic potential, because millions of would-be participants simply can’t afford to live there. This has major implications for our long-term economic growth, something we should all be concerned about.\n\nAs you can see, the housing channel is incredibly complex and interconnected. And it’s only one of the many channels we look at to determine how monetary policy is transmitting through the economy. It’s a reminder of why I have always approached this job with humility.\n\nThe economy isn’t the Federal Reserve, or interest rates, or numbers in a data report. The economy is people — living and working and making the best decisions they can with the information they have.\n\nThe only way we can make sound monetary policy decisions is to carefully consider all these different perspectives — not only in what the data tell us, but in what we hear from people directly. Because if we only looked at the economy from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole lot about what’s happening on the ground.\n\nIt’s also why I love coming to events like this one. While my remarks tonight were confined to monetary policy and the residential home market, I’m eager to hear from all of you about what you’re seeing in the commercial real estate space. You’re on the frontlines of the future of work, the future of retail, and the future of our cities — the very factors that will drive the future of our economy. Any insights you’d like to share tonight would be well considered and much appreciated.\n\nWith that, let’s get to your questions and comments.",

It’s great to be here with all of you, and I’m eager to get to our conversation.\n\nBut with the Federal Reserve in the news a lot lately, I wanted to take a few minutes at the top to frame our discussion. What can I say, it’s the former professor in me.\n\nLet me start with the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are my own, and they don’t necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFirst, let me address the topic you’ve probably heard about the most recently: the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. One of the Fed’s most important jobs is supervising and regulating banks. So let me put your minds at ease: The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.\n\nBut we’re not taking anything for granted. We know that problems in a few banks, if left unattended, can undermine confidence in healthy banks. That’s why the Federal Reserve is leading a thorough, transparent, and swift review of the events involving SVB so that we can learn from this experience.\n\nWith that being said, let’s talk a little about the Fed and its other important job: monetary policy. As many of you know, the Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, based in Washington, D.C., and 12 regional banks around the country.\n\nEach regional bank has its own president and board of directors — a group of business, banking, and community leaders who give us insight into the sectors and issues that make each region tick.\n\nMy District — the Third District — covers eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and all of Delaware. It’s the smallest District geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\n\nThe decentralized nature of the Fed is, in my mind, our greatest strength.\n\nWe’re tasked with making national policy in service of our dual mandate — full employment and price stability. But we serve an enormous country made up of vastly different economic realities. If we looked at data only from a 30,000-foot view, we’d miss a whole lot about what’s happening on the ground.\n\nSo, what have we been learning about the state of the economy from all of our inputs?\n\nOn the employment side of the dual mandate, we see that job gains are strong, and the unemployment rate remains low — 3.5 percent nationally last month. We are, effectively, at full employment.\n\nBut on the inflation side, we see a lot of room for improvement. Headline PCE inflation has come down from its peak of 7 percent last year (year over year, June 2022) but is still running, year over year, at 5 percent — way above our 2 percent target. And recent readings show that disinflation is proceeding slowly — which is disappointing, to say the least.\n\nThis persistently high inflation comes with real costs for Americans — cutting into purchasing power and household wealth. And, as is so often the case, the pain isn’t distributed equally. The toll is falling most heavily on those least able to bear it. I’m especially concerned about the rising costs of shelter, food, and health care — life’s true necessities.\n\nTo combat inflation, the Fed is working to slow the economy modestly and bring it more in line with supply. To accomplish this, we have increased the federal funds rate — our primary monetary policy tool — by 475 basis points since March 2022. Balance sheet reduction is another way to tighten conditions.\n\nWe’re already seeing promising signs that these actions are working — for example, house price indexes are cooling.\n\nSince the full impact of monetary policy actions can take as much as 18 months to work its way through the economy, we will continue to look closely at available data to determine what, if any, additional actions we may need to take. But make no mistake: We are fully committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent target.\n\nBefore we get to our Q&A, I’ll leave you with one final thought.\n\nWith all the attention our interest rate decisions get every six weeks, it might seem like the Fed is the primary force driving what happens in the economy. But that’s just not the case.\n\nThe Fed implements monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate for an economy made up of countless workers, businesses, investors, and institutions. An economy that you are, and will continue to be, an important part of — especially with your Wharton education backing you up.\n\nAs you think about the opportunities that await you beyond this place, one of the most powerful things you can do is be intentional about how you want to contribute to the economy.\n\nWhether you head to Wall Street, become an entrepreneur, or pursue a career in public service, you have a tremendous opportunity to help shape the world around you. I hope you take advantage of it.\n\nWith that, let’s get to your questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon! It’s great to return to this event. It was 2017 when I last spoke at this annual economic outlook. My topic back then focused on challenges in the economy. Here we are in 2023 — and there are still economic challenges to address — albeit very different ones from six years ago.\n\nThere are a few areas we’ll explore today. First, because I can’t resist donning my old teaching cap, I’d like to offer some background about what the Fed is and what it does. I’ll also talk about what the Fed doesn’t do, because sometimes the Fed’s powers are overestimated. I’ll then pivot to the economic outlook for our country and our region, and touch on my approach to monetary policy. After that, we can get to some questions, which is something I always enjoy and look forward to.\n\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet’s start with some Fed history.\n\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become everybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located right here in Philadelphia when it was still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt from the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different than the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n\nAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was too strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than standing armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian argument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was dissolved.\n\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the imaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And about 20 years after that, Congress decided not to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful, centralized institutions.\n\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\n\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was marked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan actually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked out.\n\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains that way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual adoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent inevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized structure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the unique demands of the United States and our economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional Banks located around the country, including the one I oversee here in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and board of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area. Fundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues that make the region tick. We are here in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\n\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but we’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the ground. Conditions can look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Trenton than they do in Dallas, Salt Lake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\n\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such a big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger populations, and no other country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast, spreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\n\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\n\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single goal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\n\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the unemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor markets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable inflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both topics in a bit.\n\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are built entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\n\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What, exactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we don’t do.\n\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority over fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or grants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials, be they on the local, state, or national level.\n\nSo, what do we do?\n\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies. We are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\n\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest rates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have a truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Development and Regional Outreach Department, and they work with partners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on employment, transportation, housing, and other issues.\n\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly conscripted set of tools.\n\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re tilling the land.\n\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other tools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds rate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate tends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we move the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and that businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just announcing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\n\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year.\n\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three years, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, which conducts the Fed’s market operations, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the System. I’m voting this year. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence. Regardless of whether we are voting or not, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion.\n\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to swings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike elected officials, who suffer the slings and arrows of the 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence of the Fed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the pressures of politics.\n\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered “independent within the government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the presidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\n\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when economic conditions are troubled.\n\nI just stepped back in time a few hundred years to consider the Fed’s origins. In keeping with that time travel, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over the past several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without considering where we’ve come from.\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has endured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 6.5 million people globally have perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and nearly 50,000 Pennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our lifetimes.\n\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of the pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus spread and state and local governments closed businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs in one of the sharpest recessions in American history.\n\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened restrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed and deployed.\n\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had opted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before COVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill, and by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial and disparate items like computer chips and cream cheese in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal government and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to a phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation in four decades.\n\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means disproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and shelter have skyrocketed in price.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\n\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Since March last year, we raised the target range for the federal funds rate from zero to between 4.5 percent and 4.75 percent. That is a significant move, and a very fast one, with the FOMC raising rates 75 basis points at several meetings. But rates are now at a level that allow us to slow down and proceed cautiously and, to my mind, the days of us raising 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. Just at the last meeting, I voted for a hike of 25 basis points — what some would call slow but actually is closer to cruising speed when it comes to tightening. In my view, we are not done yet … but we are likely close.\n\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in place and let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a significant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\n\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal Reserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, though it does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. Or an endemic shortage of workers, that unfortunately has yet to ease. But we can affect demand by making it more expensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a slowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\n\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling, the national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly even as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans are still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\n\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like leisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are cooling. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid work is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office parks.\n\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created 4.8 million jobs, and while we are seeing some layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little evidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, in the latest data release, a staggering half a million new jobs were created in January. There is now a record number of Americans employed. And indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.4 percent.\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s economy reflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but maintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along, and the unemployment rate has fallen and remains low. In fact, in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent — effectively, full employment. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the index for wages and salaries was up above 4 percent year over year in the Philadelphia–Reading–Camden region.\n\nOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to an analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered nurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting continued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail.\n\nNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is manufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, which covers the area, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s indicators for current general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future indicators suggest tempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\n\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price growth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 3.6 percent year over year in November 2022, well down from the 6 percent to 8 percent price growth we experienced during the pandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and was 22.7 percent in the Philadelphia metro area as of December. Also in December, the median days on the market for a house for sale in Philadelphia was 41 days, matching the typical pre-pandemic figure, and showcasing a softening in conditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in our rearview mirror.\n\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of goods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I forecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but suggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to 2 percent in 2025.\n\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to indicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year before climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\n\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out modestly above 4 percent this year. It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\n\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions for a healthy labor market. I hope that the first part of my talk was interesting background and that the second part helped to illuminate today’s economic environment.\n\nAnd one last historical mention — consider a visit to the First and Second Banks of the U.S. — they’re right here in our backyard at Independence National Historical Park.\n\nSo again, thanks so much for having me.

            "content": "Hello! It’s great to be here in La Jolla. I didn’t realize when I received an invitation from GIC that this event would have a connection to the Super Bowl. As we flew over Arizona, I saw that my connection would be ever so slight — and that the closest I’d get to game tickets would be passing over the stadium at 30,000 feet. Go, Eagles!\n\nThis really is a terrific program, and we’ve already had some informative sessions. So, thank you to GIC for having me and to all of you for joining us today.\n\nI would like to talk a bit today about the rapidly evolving payments landscape and, in particular, how the COVID-19 pandemic brought unique challenges to American families and accelerated changes that were already in motion. After I deliver my prepared remarks, we can have an open discussion, which I’m very much looking forward to.\n\nI will be measuring the economic and financial implications of the pandemic the way economists do, with dollars and percentages and trends. But I do not forget that the pandemic has been — first and foremost — a humanitarian tragedy of global scale. More than 6.5 million people perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans. And those numbers would have been much worse if not for the many public health workers, and others in essential businesses, who stepped up so that others could stay safe.\n\nConsumer finance is an important area of study at the Philadelphia Fed, where our CFI — Consumer Finance Institute — continues to pursue path-breaking research. Simply put, the way Americans spend, save, and invest has profound consequences for the financial industry, the broader economy, and, of course, American families. Understanding consumer finance patterns — how they change and how they will continue to evolve — is vital to the Federal Reserve’s mission of fostering an economy where everyone can prosper.\n\nAnd speaking of the Federal Reserve, here is where I give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI think we all know that the COVID-19 pandemic changed a lot about American society. Some changes, such as our inability to convene for events like this one, were thankfully fleeting. But in many areas, the pandemic simply accelerated changes that were already taking place, and it is quite natural to think that those changes are more likely to remain. To disentangle the fleeting from the long lasting, we need to look at how consumer finance was already changing prior to the pandemic and how the American people — and the institutions that serve them — reacted to the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic.\n\nToday I’ll share some of what we’ve seen in the realms of liquidity, spending, and adoption of new financial tools over the last few years.\n\nI’d like to begin by considering the effect of the pandemic on Americans’ access to liquidity, primarily in the form of cash holdings and checking account balances. A staggering 20 million workers lost their jobs in April 2020, and while many were rapidly rehired, total employment only returned to pre-pandemic levels two years later. Data collected in November 2020 in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers indicated that more than half of the respondents had experienced some type of disruption to their employment or income since the beginning of the pandemic. As we know, one of the principal federal responses to the crisis was to provide direct stimulus payments (through the CARES Act) and enhanced unemployment benefits to Americans. How did these relief measures pass through to consumers' wallets?\n\nThe pandemic certainly made life unpredictable; we can all attest to that. The Diary of Consumer Payment Choice found that consumers continued to demand cash in that uncertain environment. This Federal Reserve survey showed that, on average, consumers held 25 percent more cash in their wallets in 2020 than they did in 2019. This figure dropped in 2021 to be more in line with pre-pandemic levels. Similarly, consumers held more cash at home, in the car, or elsewhere in both 2020 and in 2021 than they did in 2019 by significant amounts.\n\nTurning to checking account balances, the Fed’s Survey of Consumer Finances showed a generally rising trend in checking and similar balances through 2019, but unfortunately, the timing of that triennial survey did not align well with the crisis.\n\nI would instead turn to some of the most timely information available on balances in consumer checking accounts during the pandemic, published by the JPMorgan Chase Institute. The underlying data are based on a representative sample of their checking account customers. Keeping in mind that those customers may not be entirely representative of checking or deposit account holders in general, it still provides some illuminating information.\n\nAccording to the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the median balance in checking accounts increased significantly from late 2019, spiking at various times matching the largest disbursements of stimulus funds, enhanced unemployment support, and tax refunds. While this phenomenon occurred broadly across their study population, some of the largest increases were seen in the more vulnerable groups.\n\nDespite this seemingly positive news, it’s important to keep in mind that many of these changes were the result of temporary relief measures implemented by the government. It is unlikely that permanent change takes hold in the overall liquidity of households, particularly of lower-income households. In June 2022, median checking account balances remained significantly higher than they were in 2019, but they were also significantly lower than their peak values realized in March 2021. And while many low-income consumers had some of the largest increases, a sizable share have average balances lower in mid-2022 than prior to the pandemic. As we move further into the post-pandemic economy, it will be crucial to understand which phenomena are likely to revert to the previous norms and which are sustainable, and for whom.\n\nWe saw quite profound changes in the way Americans made payments throughout the pandemic. These shifts speak to the adaptability of the American people and the financial system during unprecedented circumstances. However, it is also true that many of these changes were already in motion prior to the pandemic.\n\nLet me now take a moment to describe what we were seeing before the pandemic. Up until the end of 2019, there was a gradual decline in the share of consumer transactions that used cash for payments, and a much more rapid decline in the number and value of paper checks used to make payments. ACH transactions — typically direct deposit and some bill payments — were growing but no longer as quickly as they had over previous decades.\n\nUnmistakable was the rapid growth in the number and value of credit and debit card payments. Among those, consumer purchases online, typically made by credit and debit cards, outpaced card transactions used for in-store purchases. Finally, contactless card payments, digital wallets, and peer-to-peer (P2P) payments facilitated by companies like Zelle and Venmo, while still relatively uncommon, were clearly growing.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit. And like so much else, the way Americans spent changed drastically.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Payments Study did a comprehensive job describing the shifts in noncash payments that occurred in the first year of the pandemic. For one, the number of card payments — credit, debit, and prepaid — declined in 2020. This was unprecedented. The total dollar value of card payments grew slightly, but that growth was well below trend. Industry sources confirm that the weakness was primarily in credit cards. In fact, the value of debit transactions increased substantially in 2020, relative to 2019. This shift from credit to debit cards began to reverse in late 2021, with the value of credit transactions growing more rapidly than debit.\n\nUnpacking these top-level shifts, the mix of in-person and remote payments also changed in these early pandemic years: In 2018, the total value of in-person and remote payments were about the same, but in 2020, the value of remote payments exceeded that of in-person card payments by 10 percentage points. This may be a more persistent change because while consumers have resumed going to restaurants and grocery stores, they appear to be still making relatively fewer in-person payments in those locations, possibly because they can pay remotely and then pick up their goods.\n\nThe pandemic also appears to have contributed to significant growth in several recent payment innovations. The growth in the use of contactless cards, for instance, accelerated even while the number of in-person payments declined. Contactless payments now account for 4.6 percent of the number of in-person payments, more than double its share in 2019. There was a similar effect for P2P payments and digital wallets. In the first half of 2020, 18 percent of deposit accounts experienced their first P2P payment, and 11 percent of credit or debit card accounts experienced their first digital wallet payment. I do not expect these changes to reverse.\n\nWe talked about cash as a means of storing liquidity, but what about cash as a means of payment? To examine those trends, we look again to the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice. The latest summaries of this survey report that the share of payment transactions made with cash has been falling over time, fell precipitously in 2020, and then actually rose slightly in 2021 as in-person transactions picked up. A bit of a roller coaster, then. But the bottom line is that the cash share of payments remains well below pre-pandemic levels — this being a clear example of the pandemic accelerating change that was already in motion.\n\nFinally, as is often the case, we can learn the most by going directly to the source — in this case, the consumers. Late last year, the Philadelphia Fed’s CFI did just that, asking consumers whether they were using specific forms of payment more or less than they were in 2021. On net, consumers reported using cash and checks less and contactless cards more. They also indicated they were using P2P apps and mobile payment apps more frequently. As is typically the case, younger consumers tend to be the most likely adopters of payment innovations. Roughly speaking, this suggests that indeed the pandemic accelerated the longer-run trends of declining use for paper forms of payment and a more robust adoption of new, electronic ways of making payments.\n\nAnd now for something that can’t get lost between a seat cushion: the latest newcomers to the landscape, cryptocurrencies. As you surely know, cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many others) in which transactions are verified and records are maintained by a decentralized, distributed ledger system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.\n\nSince the early 2010s, the rise of so-called cryptocurrencies has received significant attention from financial market participants, policymakers, and academics.\n\nCryptocurrencies have been marketed in a variety of ways. Early in their existence, they were touted as a more secure and anonymous method of payment, and a means of keeping funds out of the traditional banking system, while recent messaging has shifted to their value as an investment vehicle.\n\nCryptocurrency markets have gained a reputation for high volatility in recent years, with rapid price increases and decreases over relatively short periods. For a considerable stretch of time, beginning in early 2019, prices trended up significantly, leading to a perception of cryptocurrencies as lucrative investment vehicles. Beginning in early 2022, however, the cryptocurrency market experienced what is described by some as a crypto winter, a prolonged bear market that resulted in a nearly $2 trillion loss in market value, coin and exchange collapses, and damage to a number of financial services firms that are closely aligned to the crypto space.\n\nIn January 2022, CFI, in conjunction with economists from the Federal Reserve Board, included questions related to cryptocurrency ownership and opinions in the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. The survey gave us a basic understanding of the adoption of, and attitudes toward, cryptocurrencies among the survey population, with special attention paid to differences across demographic groups. The results of that survey are found in a CFI Research Brief published in December and available on the Philadelphia Fed’s website.\n\nIn the months since that survey was conducted, the drastic change in prices and associated turmoil — again, the recent period referred to as a crypto winter — likely contributed to a shift in attitudes regarding cryptocurrencies among owners and nonowners alike. Therefore, in October 2022, we again surveyed consumers to see how perceptions of cryptocurrencies had changed. I’d like to share some highlights from our published report and touch on some new, previously unpublished, information based on the new survey.\n\nIn the survey fielded last January, we found that almost one-quarter of respondents, or someone in their immediate family, owned cryptocurrency at that time. Most current crypto owners had acquired those assets recently. More than two-thirds of crypto owners last January had acquired their first crypto assets within the previous 12 months, almost a third in the previous six months. This surge in adoption took place in a media environment that saw massive increases in the marketing of cryptocurrencies during 2021. Unlike many of the other changes discussed, the rise of cryptocurrency does not seem to be directly related to the pandemic, though an environment of low rates, ample liquidity, and, quite frankly, more time at home may have all contributed.\n\nThe survey asked owners about why they chose to purchase crypto. Just under 30 percent of crypto owners cited financial reasons, though some viewed their purchases as short-term investments in anticipation of rapid appreciation, while others were looking for long-term investments for stable growth. Almost one-quarter of crypto owners had acquired their assets out of simple curiosity, and just under 20 percent suggested their decision was influenced either by family or social media. A relatively small share of crypto owners — around 15 percent — suggested they had acquired their assets primarily because they expected to use them for transactional purposes.\n\nWe also asked about future crypto purchase plans. In January 2022, slightly more than half of the existing crypto owners (55 percent) said they were likely to buy more crypto. Nonowners remained skeptical, with less than 7 percent of them saying they were likely to buy crypto in the future.\n\nDemographic analysis of crypto ownership for the most part conforms with our usual expectations. For example, crypto ownership is relatively more common among younger respondents and respondents reporting higher incomes. This is consistent with research suggesting that these are categories of consumers who are more likely to be early adopters of new financial tools and technologies. Similarly, the likelihood of owning crypto assets was higher among respondents who were also engaged in mobile and P2P payments or mobile banking.\n\nMen were more likely than women to own crypto assets. Black and Hispanic respondents were more likely to own crypto assets than White respondents.\n\nNow let’s turn to what we learned when we examined the responses from consumers in the more recent October 2022 survey. Keep in mind that respondents to the January survey had yet to go through the crypto winter, while the October respondents had already lived through most of it. And it shows.\n\nCrypto ownership among respondents decreased significantly, from 25 percent in January 2022 to 19 percent in October. We observed decreases in the rate of ownership across nearly all demographic groups. Nevertheless, the relative concentration of crypto ownership across the population changed little: Younger, male, more affluent, or non-White consumers remain the most engaged demographic groups with crypto.\n\nFuture plans to purchase more crypto assets cooled, with less than 40 percent of October’s owners indicating that they will likely buy more in the future. Remember that, in January, more than half of respondents said they had future plans to purchase more crypto.\n\nDespite the crypto winter, short- and long-term investment remain the most commonly chosen reasons for buying crypto. Indeed, these reasons seem to have become more important. In October, 35 percent of crypto owners cited long-term growth as a principal reason for owning; that is an increase from 29 percent of crypto owners last January. Somewhat less surprisingly, crypto owners in October were less likely to cite social reasons for holding these assets than were crypto owners last January.\n\nInterestingly, curiosity remained strong as a purchase reason, increasing from 24 percent of crypto owners in January to nearly 30 percent of crypto owners in October. We see this as an indicator that there is still interest among consumers in cryptocurrencies, with the depressed prices of the crypto winter possibly providing an opportunity to satisfy that interest for some.\n\nWhat do we take from these data? In many ways, it is what we would expect to see from a market after a downturn: Participation and interest in the market both decreased as groups of consumers shy away from risk. The strength of investment and experimentation as reasons for participation in the market has remained steady and the socioeconomic groups most likely to acquire cryptocurrencies haven’t materially changed. These patterns seem to suggest that cryptocurrencies will remain in demand by certain consumers despite the recent crypto winter.\n\nSo, I realize I’ve thrown a lot of data at you. And although we are convening in a college town today, I promise there won’t be a quiz. But I am going to assign some homework. Have a look at the Consumer Finance section on the Philadelphia Fed website; you’ll find some very interesting work there.\n\nWhat I do think is that these data offer unique insights about the way American society responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and its unprecedented strain. It allows us to discern which changes are likely to be fleeting and which ones were already in motion prior to the pandemic and are likely to be long lasting.\n\nWe saw how pandemic-era policies and lifestyle shifts led to a run-up in household liquidity; however, overall, this run-up is not likely to be sustainable for everyone.\n\nWe saw Americans embrace new ways of making payments as they, first, shifted to online shopping, and then made changes to their payment habits that apparently have real staying power.\n\nAnd we’ve seen how consumers responded to dramatic changes in the cryptocurrency markets, slowing, but likely not reversing, the growth of that sector in the coming years.\n\nWhat we have yet to see is how these shifts will play out in the long run — and how they will affect the Federal Reserve’s solemn responsibility of fostering an economy where all Americans can thrive.\n\nSo, thanks again for having me. Now let’s get to the discussion.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be here. As a lifelong Jersey boy, I’m very glad to be with a group of my fellow New Jerseyans. Though as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I’m not so sure how I feel about doing this way up here in Somerset.\n\nI plan to talk a bit about the country’s economic outlook and my approach to monetary policy. Then we can get to questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs we begin, I think it’s worth taking a step back and considering, briefly, how much has transpired over the past several years. You really can’t understand where our economy is, or where it’s going, without considering where we’ve come from.\n\nFirst and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has endured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally have perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 35,000 New Jerseyans. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our lifetimes.\n\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of the pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus spread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of millions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American history.\n\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened restrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed and deployed.\n\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had opted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before COVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill, and by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items like computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal government and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to a phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation in four decades.\n\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means disproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and shelter have skyrocketed in price.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\n\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal funds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one, given that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my view, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\n\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in place to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a significant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\n\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal Reserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though it does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more expensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a slowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\n\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling, the national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly even as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans are still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\n\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered the most during the pandemic, like leisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing are cooling somewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid work is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office parks.\n\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created 4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little evidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed. And indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\n\nIn New Jersey, conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, this region’s economy reflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but maintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along, unemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in the state of New Jersey, the unemployment rate stands at 3.4 percent — effectively, full employment. As of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over year in the Philadelphia–Reading–Camden region.\n\nOur state’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is manufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, which partially covers New Jersey, suggested overall declines in the sector in January. The survey’s indicators for current general activity and new orders remained negative, and the survey’s future indicators suggest tempered expectations for growth over the next six months.\n\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Single-family price growth in New Jersey is trending downward and was only around 9.5 percent year over year in November 2022, well down from the double-digit price growth we experienced during the pandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut has increased over the past year and was 22.7 percent in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and 14.3 percent in the New York City MSA as of December. In October, meanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in New Jersey was 51 days, compared with less than 30 days in May 2021, showcasing softening conditions.\n\nIn happier news, we are finally starting to see steady progress bringing inflation down across an array of goods. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I forecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but suggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to 2 percent in 2025.\n\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to indicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year before climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\n\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5 percent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\n\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions for a healthy labor market. Given that you are bankers, I would also mention something I always keep in mind as a policymaker: When uncertainty abounds, it pays to be cautious. Just as I, as a member of the FOMC, am working to minimize risk, I also urge you all to think about the risks your clients face and to make good decisions to guard against any possible losses.\n\nSo again, thanks so much for having me.

I had many very happy years as president here, though I did recall the one downside to working here as I made my way down I-95 this afternoon: the traffic.\n\nIn all seriousness, it’s really an honor to be here for today’s event. I plan to speak a bit about the national economy, monetary policy, and an exciting new initiative from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.

It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\n\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to talk a little bit about an exciting new initiative from the Philadelphia Fed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening here on the STAR Campus today because this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\n\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions and hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\n\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of talent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\n\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made sizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic — higher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s one of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing facilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to stay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are often among the largest employers in their regions.\n\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the ups and downs of the business cycle. Enrollment in colleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows, usually more people go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant; after all, people require medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests that regions with strong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n\nAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the areas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen more hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local commercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood amenities.\n\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress. Fundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new venture formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development and growth.\n\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology, demographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated both telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and universities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services. Suddenly, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\n\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals. With falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the future, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most apparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges and universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future — and the impact that will have on communities.\n\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals. Even here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\n\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced out of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\n\nThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a new tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500 regions across the country.\n\nFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or induced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly by anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields that directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are those that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate.\n\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance index for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional economy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and incorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance index of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that means it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\n\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of anchor institutions is massive; 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and 8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That translates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the economy.\n\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on anchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s reliance index, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds employment, income, and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent more dependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a whole.\n\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the dashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the information there useful and important.\n\nIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for attending, and the Federal Reserve’s strong commitment to bringing down inflation. Now let’s get on to the discussion.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be here with so many friends from the chamber and elsewhere. And after a couple of years of virtual events, it’s particularly gratifying to see all of you in 3D! Thanks so much for having me. It’s truly an honor and a pleasure.\n\nOf course, given that so many of you are old friends, I’m sure you know what I’m about to say next. That’s right, it’s time for the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn a few minutes, I’ll be on a panel devoted to forecasting what 2023 holds in store for our national and local economies. But, to my mind, you can’t hope to predict what will happen in the future without having an accurate perception of what’s going on right now.\n\nThat’s where the Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia’s annual member survey comes in. This survey — and thank you to all who participated — is an invaluable tool for understanding what’s happening right now in the real economy. I hope you all have had a chance to look at the results because they really do tell us a lot.\n\nSurvey data are an important tool in the economic business. At the Fed, we look at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like restaurant reservations and mobility data. These data — hard data — tell us a lot.\n\nBut as a policymaker, I’ve come to believe that soft data like survey results are perhaps equally important to getting a full understanding of our economic situation. Candidly, an overemphasis on hard data can lead to policy errors; last year, hard data suggested to us that inflation would be “transitory,” whereas the soft data we were hearing from our contacts indicated that rising prices were proving more persistent than we may have expected. Which is to say, paying due attention to soft data is vitally important to effective policymaking.\n\nSo again, I hope you will take a few minutes to delve into the survey results. But in the meantime, I want to share a few insights that I found particularly important.\n\nOverall, members reported strong activity in both the region and for their businesses in 2022 compared with 2021. However, expectations for 2023 were mixed. While firms remained somewhat optimistic for their own operations, they also expressed uncertainty over the expected economic performance of the broader region.\n\nNot surprisingly — and unfortunately — a vast majority of respondents reported higher prices paid in 2022 than in 2021. To offset these increased costs, most respondents reported higher prices received in 2022 than in 2021. Most respondents expect prices to continue to rise this year.\n\nTurning to the labor market, firms reported having more full-time employees on their payrolls in 2022 than during the year prior. While there were a few firms that laid off some of their employees, that represented a very small percentage of respondents.\n\nFirms’ wages and benefit costs rose, with nearly all respondents reporting slightly or significantly higher labor costs in 2022 than the year before. Respondents also expect increases to persist into 2023. Members reported that hiring has been a challenge, particularly because of the level of compensation being demanded by applicants. To hire new workers or retain existing staff, many respondents have raised compensation, introduced a remote work policy, or promoted existing employees.\n\nGiven this backdrop, it’s not surprising that labor was cited as a top concern by many respondents. Chamber members also cited the availability of financing and interest rates as pressing concerns. This, too, is no surprise, given changes in monetary policy over the past year.\n\nSo, I think all in all, you can say respondents have painted a picture of mixed economic conditions. I’d expect similarly mixed conditions in the year ahead, which we can delve into during the panel discussion. While I recognize forecasting can be a tricky business, I’m very excited for the discussion.\n\nI will add that one forecast I’m fully confident in making at this point is that the Eagles will soon embark on a remarkable playoff run.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for having me.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to see you all here. I was reminded before today’s breakfast that I was here for the last in-person event that the Main Line chamber hosted prior to the pandemic, back in February 2020.\n\nAnd it’s great to be back. I plan to speak a bit about the economic outlook for the country and our region, and then we can get to your questions, which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nBut first, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIf we take a step back, it’s quite remarkable how much has transpired since we were last together. First and foremost, of course, is the humanitarian tragedy that our country — and our world — has endured because of the COVID-19 virus over the past three years. More than 7.5 million people globally have perished from the virus, including more than 1 million of our fellow Americans and 50,000 Pennsylvanians. This is a public health catastrophe on a global scale that is unprecedented in any of our lifetimes.\n\nThe tribulations of the U.S. economy over this period have been startling as well. During the early part of the pandemic, the national economy suffered its largest contraction in recorded history as the virus spread and state and local governments shuttered businesses that they deemed nonessential. Tens of millions of Americans were thrown into joblessness in one of the sharpest recessions in American history.\n\nThat downturn was followed by a period of extraordinary economic growth as states loosened restrictions and, with astonishing rapidity, highly effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed and deployed.\n\nBut even as the economy came roaring back to health, scars were visible. Many older Americans had opted to retire at the onset of the pandemic, leaving labor force participation below where it was before COVID-19 arrived on our shores. Supply chains were badly damaged by the virus itself as workers fell ill, and by government lockdowns, which shuttered factories for extended periods. This left crucial items like computer chips in short supply. Meanwhile, large doses of fiscal spending from the federal government and accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve stoked demand. This led to a phenomenon known colloquially as “too much money chasing too few goods” and the highest inflation in four decades.\n\nHigh inflation is a scourge, leading to economic inefficiencies and hurting Americans of limited means disproportionately. I find it particularly disturbing that life’s true essentials like groceries, fuel, and shelter have skyrocketed in price.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is absolutely committed to bringing inflation back to our 2 percent target.\n\nAnd we’re doing that by adjusting our monetary policy. Last year, we raised the target for the federal funds rate to between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. That was a significant move, and a very fast one, given that we started the year at about 0 percent. I expect that we will raise rates a few more times this year, though, to my mind, the days of us raising them 75 basis points at a time have surely passed. In my view, hikes of 25 basis points will be appropriate going forward.\n\nAt some point this year, I expect that the policy rate will be restrictive enough that we will hold rates in place to let monetary policy do its work. We are also shrinking our balance sheet, which is removing a significant amount of accommodation in and of itself.\n\nOur goal is to slow the economy modestly and to bring demand more in line with supply. The Federal Reserve obviously can’t fix problems like supply chain issues, or an endemic shortage of workers, though it does seem like these problems are finally easing a bit. But we can affect demand by making it more expensive to borrow money. And that’s clearly already happening: We’re seeing unmistakable signs of a slowdown in the most interest-rate sensitive parts of the economy, like housing.\n\nWhat’s encouraging is that even as we are raising rates, and seeing some signs that inflation is cooling, the national economy remains relatively healthy overall. In parts of 2022, the economy grew modestly even as we were tightening monetary policy substantially. Although inflation is biting, many Americans are still spending — even if they dip into their savings to do so.\n\nWe’re seeing a healthy recovery in those sectors that suffered most during the pandemic, like leisure and hospitality, while some sectors that built up healthy order books like manufacturing, are cooling somewhat. I do remain concerned about commercial real estate, as the embrace of remote and hybrid work is clearly dampening demand for office space in central business districts and suburban office parks.\n\nI’m most pleased that the labor market remains in excellent shape. Last year, the U.S. economy created 4.5 million jobs, and while we are seeing scattered layoffs in certain segments like tech, there is little evidence of a major downturn in the job market. In fact, a record number of Americans are employed. And indeed, the national unemployment rate is exceptionally low at 3.5 percent.\n\nLocal conditions look broadly similar. Much like the national economy, the Philadelphia area’s economy reflects weakening conditions in business and interest-rate sensitive areas such as housing, but maintains significant strengths, particularly in the labor market. Payroll growth continues to chug along, unemployment claims have stayed low, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. In fact, in the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area, the unemployment rate stands at 3.8 percent — effectively, full employment. As of the third quarter of 2022, wages were up nearly 5 percent year over year in the Philadelphia–Reading–Camden region.\n\nOf course, even in a hot job market, some positions remain more in demand than others. According to an analysis of job listings for the Philadelphia area, some of the most frequent job ads are for registered nurses, retail salespeople, software developers, and customer service representatives, reflecting continued hot demand in health care, tech, and retail. I continue to see biotech as a key growth industry in our region as well, with firms unable to build wet labs fast enough. That’s driving labor demand not only for PhDs and college graduates, but also those with high school diplomas.\n\nNow, our region’s strengths are vulnerable to ongoing challenges. One obvious weak spot is manufacturing. Responses to the Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey suggested continuing declines in the sector. The survey’s indicators for general activity, new orders, and shipments were all negative, and manufacturing firms reported a decline in employment, on balance.\n\nHousing is also weakening considerably, certainly in part due to higher interest rates. Home price growth in Philadelphia County is trending downward and was only around 5 percent year over year in September 2022. Nearby counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have higher home price growth, ranging between 8 percent and 20 percent, respectively, well below the huge gains logged during the pandemic. According to Zillow, the share of listings with a price cut in the Philadelphia metro area has increased over the past several months and was up by more than a quarter in November. In October, meanwhile, the median days on the market for a house for sale in the Philadelphia metro area was 38 days. This is closing in on the typical prepandemic figure, which was 41 days, showcasing a softening in conditions. The days of houses selling before they are even listed are in our rearview mirror. So, sorry to all the realtors in the audience this morning.\n\nAlso in the rearview mirror, I expect, are the eye-popping inflation readings of 2022. With monetary policy doing its work, supply chains healing, and excess demand running off, I forecast core inflation to come in at around 3.5 percent this year — well over our 2 percent target, but suggestive of clear movement in the right direction. Core inflation should fall to 2.5 percent in 2024 and then back down to 2 percent in 2025.\n\nGDP growth will be modest, but I’m not forecasting a recession. The labor markets are simply too hot to indicate a significant downturn at this point. I expect real GDP growth of about 1 percent this year before climbing back up to trend growth of about 2 percent in 2024 and 2025.\n\nLastly, I do think we will see a very slight uptick in unemployment, probably topping out at about 4.5 percent this year, before falling back toward 4 percent over the next two years. It’s an underrated advantage that the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of such labor market strength.\n\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is committed to bringing down inflation and to maintaining the conditions for a healthy labor market.\n\nThanks so much for having me. Let’s hope it’s not another three years before we see each other again. Now, let’s get to your questions.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to see you all in person, and it’s great to be in University City. And, of course, congratulations, George! Your award is very well deserved.\n\nI’d like to take a few minutes this morning to discuss the national economy, inflation, monetary policy, and an exciting new research initiative from the Philadelphia Fed. And then, we can get to your questions. But please, nothing about baseball: The wounds are still too fresh.\n\nBefore I can go any further, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet’s begin with the national economy, where there are signs that activity is decelerating. Credit card purchase data indicate that consumer spending, which comprises around 70 percent of economic activity in the United States, is slowing, with services and retail leading the decline. Investment in housing has weakened, and even the boom in manufacturing, which has buoyed the economy, is starting to wane.\n\nAfter two negative quarters of GDP growth to start the year, the third quarter saw growth of 2.6 percent. That growth was largely due to strong exports. In sum, the reopening boom we experienced as businesses came back to life after a pandemic-induced hibernation appears to be pretty much over.\n\nThere is one glaring exception to this rather lackluster data set: employment. The job market continues to run extremely hot. The national unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, and we still have more than 10 million unfilled jobs. All of which is to say, one economic category has certainly not suffered even as other sectors have slowed: Help Wanted signs.\n\nNow to inflation, which remains far, far too high.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation, and right now, annualized PCE inflation, including food and energy, stands at 6.2 percent. Prices were up 0.3 percent in September from just a month before. Moreover, inflation is widespread throughout the economy, with numerous categories continuing to register hefty increases.\n\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those of low or moderate income. I find it particularly alarming that we’re seeing rapid price increases in life’s true essentials, like food, rent, health care, and gasoline.\n\nThe bottom line is that we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation expectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient as we can in the long run, we have to get on top of inflation.\n\nWe are committed to bringing down inflation.\n\nTo do so effectively, we need to understand what has caused it. A global pandemic, a war in Europe, and fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to limit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\n\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. We all know about semiconductor shortages, which have limited supplies of everything from new cars to washing machines. These shortages persist, owing largely to China’s Zero-COVID policy. But the pandemic has wrought shortages in more obscure items. A major auto company, for instance, is having a hard time securing enough of its trademark emblems, which has in turn slowed shipments of new vehicles.\n\nRussia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\n\nAfter Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, shipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food prices. The decline in Russia’s energy exports has helped fuel the rise in energy prices, causing an energy crisis in Europe and the U.K. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again. OPEC Plus has further compounded our problems by announcing it will cut production, even in the face of elevated prices. We know that gas prices are incredibly important to consumers and responsible for much of the decline in consumer sentiment.\n\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on the overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal government applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber. Our immigration policy, such as it is, has resulted in a more than two-year pause in legal immigration. As a result, we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would have had, if we had remained on trend.\n\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by robust demand. For one, as I indicated earlier, our labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value is declining because of inflation.\n\nNot surprisingly, low unemployment rates have produced significant upward pressure on wages. In many regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions. We’ve heard from community bankers who can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers.\n\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American households during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic through programs like mortgage forbearance and student loan forbearance. In fact, the amount of fiscal support provided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered by the pandemic in the first place.\n\nThat aid was also dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. That’s understandable, of course: We were in the middle of a full-blown panic, and the federal government needed to get money out the door. But it’s clear that policies like these contributed to high levels of demand.\n\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low, which stoked demand.\n\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying program.\n\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation. And as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see inflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array of goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate and our balance sheet.\n\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market interpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper our asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases caused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\n\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our balance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial accommodation quite rapidly.\n\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 375 basis points since the start of the year. Granted, we started from zero, but we have raised rates significantly — and very quickly.\n\nIn the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow the pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I want to be clear: A rate hike of 50 basis points would still be significant. Since 1983, the FOMC has increased the target a total of 88 times, and of those, 75 of the hikes were less than 50 basis points.\n\nAt some point next year, I expect we will hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do its work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\n\nAfter that, if we have to, we can always tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system work itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time.\n\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really need to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening monetary policy. And again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year as both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat GDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\n\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect core PCE inflation to come in around 4.8 percent in 2022, around 3.5 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\n\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak at 4.5 percent next year as financial conditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that, even as we tighten monetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy. We’ve heard from contacts in manufacturing that, given how hard they have worked to staff up, they will be extremely reluctant to cut jobs even as the economy slows.\n\nThat gives me confidence that we can bring inflation under control without doing unnecessary damage to the labor market. Our resolve is strong, and our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is achievable.\n\nNow, in the remaining few minutes, I’d like to describe an exciting new initiative from the Philadelphia Fed called the Anchor Economy Initiative. It’s fitting that we are convening in University City today because this place exemplifies the Anchor Economy Initiative perfectly.\n\nThe Anchor Economy Initiative seeks to quantify the economic impact of higher education institutions and hospitals — eds and meds — that we call the anchor institutions in their communities.\n\nThis is vital work. Anchor institutions are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of talent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth.\n\nThey also have characteristics that other institutions just don’t. For one, even though they’ve made sizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic — higher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities. In fact, that’s one of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing facilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to stay where they are. Hospitals and higher education also tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are often among the largest employers in their regions.\n\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the vicissitudes of the business cycle. Enrollment in colleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows, usually more people go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant; after all, people require medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of which suggests that regions with strong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n\nAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the areas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives. We’ve seen more hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local commercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood amenities. Now I suspect you understand the connection to University City.\n\nAnchor institutions’ impact goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress. Fundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new venture formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development and growth.\n\nWe see this here in Philadelphia all the time. The talent and research coming out of our universities and health-care systems have led to the creation of a booming biotechnology industry. Which is to say, anchor institutions are not only often the largest employers themselves in regions, they’re also the producers of talent that other businesses need.\n\nLet’s not sugarcoat things, though. Eds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology, demographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated both telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and universities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services. All of a sudden, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored.\n\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals. With falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college and even fewer will enroll in the future, especially if immigration rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most apparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges and universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future — and the impact that will have on communities.\n\nOn the other hand, an aging population is one that will require more health care, boosting hospitals. Even here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed over the past several years.\n\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced out of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\n\nThat’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a new tool that quantifies the impact of higher education institutions and hospitals on more than 500 regions across the country.\n\nFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or induced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly by anchor institutions, like doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect are those working in fields that directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are those that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks working at the Last Word Bookshop have induced jobs.\n\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance index for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional economy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and incorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance index of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that means it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\n\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of anchor institutions is massive: 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and 8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added comes from higher education institutions and hospitals. That translates to 18.2 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in gross value added to the economy.\n\nHere in the Philadelphia region, the total economic impact from anchor institutions is more than 495,000 jobs, $33.8 billion in income, and $51.4 billion in gross value added. That’s nearly 13 percent of the region’s jobs, 8.4 percent of its income, and 11.4 percent of its gross value added. All told, that amounts to a reliance index of 1.39, indicating that our region is more dependent on anchor institutions than the U.S. average.\n\nI urge you all — after today’s program — to head over to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the dashboard. We have data for 524 regions across the U.S. — truly a treasure trove. I think you’ll find the information there useful and important.\n\nIn closing, I’d like to reiterate my thanks to you for joining us, and the Federal Reserve’s strong commitment to bringing down inflation. We will get this job done.\n\nNow, let’s get to your questions.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to see you all in person after two years of virtual meetings. While clicking a Zoom link is, admittedly, a little bit easier than fighting traffic or dealing with transit, there’s something undeniably invigorating about being back together physically. So thanks so much for joining us.\n\nI’m eager to take your questions, so please use the Slido code indicated on the screen behind me. But before we get to the open discussion, I’d like to take a few minutes to discuss the state of the national and regional economy, inflation, and path of monetary policy.\n\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet’s begin with the national economy, where there are signs that activity is decelerating. Credit card purchase data indicate that consumer spending, which comprises around 70 percent of economic activity in the United States, is slowing, with services and retail leading the decline.

All of which is to say, one economic category has certainly not suffered even as other sectors have slowed: Help Wanted signs.\n\nRegionally, there are signs of weakness as well, though as with the national economy, employment remains robust.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey is in negative territory, meaning that respondents are pessimistic regarding the economic environment six months from now. Importantly, however, shipments remain in positive territory as firms work off sizable order backlogs piled up during the pandemic. In residential real estate, activity has flattened after a huge boom, and we are seeing more prices being reduced for home listings.\n\nIt also appears that central business districts in our region are going to endure lighter foot traffic in the foreseeable future. Employers who have called their workers back to their offices are in many cases offering hybrid schedules, and the data reflect this. This trend tends to be more pronounced in our region than nationally. We can see this most clearly in mobility statistics, which indicate time in workplaces is down 20 percent nationally and 30 percent in Philadelphia. For public transit, the drop-off is even more stark, with time in transit stations down 20 percent nationally and 45 percent in Philadelphia.\n\nNow to inflation, which remains far, far too high.\n\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those of low or moderate income. We’re seeing huge demand at food banks — and it’s coming, in many cases, from people who are working full-time. Our contacts in the banking industry are telling us that more families are taking on unsecured debt to meet daily expenses.\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation, and right now annualized PCE inflation, including food and energy, stands at 6.2 percent. Prices were up 0.3 percent in September from just a month before. Moreover, inflation is widespread throughout the economy. While initially, price hikes were limited to just a few items like used cars, we’re now seeing rapid rises in prices on everything from new vehicles and dishwashers to life’s essentials, like food, health care, and rent.\n\nMore broadly, we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation expectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient in the long run as we can, we have to get on top of inflation.\n\nTo solve our inflation problem, we need to understand what has caused it. In this case, there is no singular cause. It has instead been a confluence of events — essentially a “perfect storm.”\n\nA global pandemic, a war in Europe, and, yes, fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to limit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\n\nWe are committed to bringing down inflation.\n\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\n\nThe events of the last few years have revealed the extraordinary fragility of global supply chains. If one ship, stuck in one canal, could ground global logistics to a halt for days, imagine the effect of a multiyear global pandemic.\n\nIn fact, we don’t need to imagine it: COVID-19 lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. We all know about semiconductor shortages, which have limited supplies of everything from new cars to washing machines. These shortages persist, owing largely to China’s Zero-COVID policy. But the pandemic has wrought shortages in more obscure items. A major auto company for instance, is having a hard time securing enough of its trademark emblems. That has slowed shipments of new vehicles.\n\nRussia’s horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\n\nAfter Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, shipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food prices. And the decline in Russia’s energy exports has helped fuel the rise in energy prices causing an energy crisis in Europe and the U.K. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again. OPEC Plus has further compounded our problems by announcing it will cut production, even in the face of elevated prices.

While I remain neutral on the overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal government applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber. Our immigration policy, such as it is, has resulted in a more than two-year pause in legal immigration. This has certainly contributed to labor shortages; we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would have had, if we had remained on trend.\n\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by robust demand. For one, as I indicated earlier, our labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value is declining because of inflation.\n\nNot surprisingly, low unemployment rates have produced significant upward pressure on wages. In many regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions. We’ve heard from community bankers who can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers. In tourist regions like the Poconos and the Jersey Shore, local businesses had a great summer in terms of sales, but they had a very hard time staying staffed. That’s partially because of higher salary demands, but also because housing has become so expensive in those areas that workers can’t afford to live there.\n\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American households during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the amount of fiscal support provided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered by the pandemic in the first place.\n\nGovernment aid was dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. For instance, mortgage forbearance and student loan forbearance were both offered to any borrowers, no questions asked, and in the case of student loans, applied automatically. Recall why these policies were enacted; we were in the middle of a full-blown panic, and the federal government needed to get money out the door. But it’s clear that policies like these contributed to high levels of demand. If you don’t have to pay your mortgage for a year, you have a lot more money to spend on other goods and services.\n\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low for long.\n\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying program. These policies stoked demand, which they were designed to do.\n\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation. And as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see inflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array of goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate — usually just thought of as interest rates — and our balance sheet.\n\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market interpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper our asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases caused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\n\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our balance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial accommodation quite rapidly.\n\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 375 basis points since the start of the year. Granted, we started from zero, but we have raised rates significantly — and very quickly.\n\nIn the upcoming months, in light of the cumulative tightening we have achieved, I expect we will slow the pace of our rate hikes as we approach a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I want to be clear: A rate hike of 50 basis points would still be significant. Since 1983, the FOMC has increased the target a total of 88 times, and of those, 75 of the hikes were less than 50 basis points.\n\nAt some point next year, I expect we will hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do its work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\n\nAfter that, if we have to, we can always tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system work itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time: Inflation is known to shoot up like a rocket and then come down like a feather.\n\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really need to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening monetary policy. And again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored.\n\nSo what does all of this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year as both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat GDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\n\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect core PCE inflation to come in around 4.8 percent in 2022, around 3.5 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\n\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak next year at 4.5 percent as financial conditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that even as we tighten monetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy. We’ve heard from contacts in manufacturing that, given how hard they have worked to staff up, they will be extremely reluctant to cut jobs even as the economy slows.\n\nThat gives me confidence that we can bring inflation under control without doing unnecessary damage to the labor market. Our resolve is strong, and our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is achievable.\n\nThanks so much for being here. I really appreciate the important work that RMA does in our region. Now let’s open things up for questions.",

            "content": "Hello! It’s great to be back in Vineland. The last time I was here three years ago, I began my talk by posing an extraordinarily controversial question: Is this the dandelion capital or egg capital of the country? Given the controversy this engendered, I think it’s better if I stick to safer subjects this time: the country’s economic outlook, as well as my thinking on monetary policy. Then we can get to our Q&A, but please, nothing about dandelions or eggs.\n\nI also said something else three years ago: my standard Fed disclaimer. That, I do intend to repeat: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInflation\n\nAs you all know, inflation is far too high. The Federal Reserve’s long-range target is 2 percent annualized inflation — and annualized inflation came in at 8.2 percent in September. Prices were up 0.4 percent in September, from just a month before.\n\nThis is a period of tremendous hardship for Americans, particularly those with low or moderate income. We’re seeing a huge demand at food banks — and it’s coming, in many cases, from people who are working full-time. Our contacts in the banking industry are telling us that more families are taking on unsecured debt to meet daily expenses.\n\nInflation is widespread throughout the economy. While price hikes were limited initially to just a few items like used cars, we’re now experiencing rapid rises in prices on everything from new vehicles and dishwashers to life’s staples, like food, gasoline, and rent. Health-care inflation continues to be troublesome, too, and, unfortunately, shows no signs of abating. In fact, I expect hefty rises in health-care premiums next year as health-care systems renegotiate reimbursements with their insurers after suffering large losses this year.\n\nBecause of high inflation, household wealth is declining. That’s partially because purchasing power is decreasing and Americans are spending their savings. It’s also because the stock market, where tens of millions of Americans stash hefty portions of their retirement savings, is down on inflation fears and rate hikes. All of this is making it harder for Americans to save and to plan for retirement.\n\nMore broadly, we can’t have a well-functioning economy with high inflation, particularly if high inflation expectations get embedded. To make the economy as efficient as we can in the long run, we have to get on top of inflation.\n\nAnd that is precisely what the Federal Reserve is doing. Inflation is a problem that must be solved. We need to see continued movement toward 2 percent core inflation. We also need to pay attention to the distribution of inflation, making sure it’s falling across a wide spectrum of goods and services throughout the economy.\n\nTo solve our inflation problem, we need to understand what has caused it. In this case, there is no singular cause. It has instead been a confluence of events, essentially, a “perfect storm.”\n\nA global pandemic, a war in Europe, and, yes, fiscal and monetary policy decisions have combined to limit supply and boost demand. The result has been inflation running at 40-year highs.\n\nLet’s begin with constraints on supply.\n\nThe events of the last few years have revealed the extraordinary fragility of global supply chains. If one ship, stuck in one canal, could ground global logistics to a halt for days, imagine the effect of a multiyear global pandemic.\n\nIn fact, we don’t need to imagine it: COVID-19 lockdowns have badly damaged supply chains. Semiconductors, present in everything from automobiles to washing machines, have been in short supply for the better part of three years as factories have shuttered for extended periods and international ports have clogged. Issues here persist, with China — “the world’s factory” — continuing to pursue a Zero-COVID policy. Even today, China continues to impose lockdowns, though there is some speculation that these policies may now begin to be relaxed with Xi Jinping having secured a third term as Chinese president.\n\nRussia’s tragic, horrific invasion of Ukraine further choked supply.\n\nShipments of grain and fertilizer fell, pushing up food prices. So did Russia’s energy exports. Europe and the U.K. are in the middle of a full-blown energy crisis. Gasoline prices spiked here, fell a bit, and are now back up again. The Saudis have further compounded our problems by announcing they will cut production, even in the face of elevated prices.\n\nCertain U.S. government policies have contributed to our supply-side issues. While I remain neutral on the overall wisdom of each of these policies, their effect on supply is undeniable. The federal government applies tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber, spiking prices. A more than two-year pause in legal immigration has contributed to labor shortages — we have about 2½ million fewer workers than we would have had, had we remained on trend.\n\nAnd housing costs are up — though moderating slightly in recent months — not just because of pricier materials and labor, but also because we are not building enough houses to keep up with demand. This is often a result of local government policies, like restrictive zoning, that stymie construction.\n\nAll of these supply constraints have been accompanied by extraordinarily robust demand. For one, our labor market remains hot. That means Americans are earning paychecks, even if their relative value is declining because of inflation. Employment in manufacturing, financial services, and other industries has long since recovered from the pandemic-induced recession, and now pent-up demand within the leisure and hospitality industry is driving employment growth as well.\n\nWith some large employers like Comcast calling workers back into the office three days a week last month, I think we are starting to see a significant recovery in central business districts. Employment has been particularly down in those areas, as restaurants, bars, dry cleaners, and local shops have been bereft of office workers for more than two years. But I must say, Center City Philadelphia is noticeably more vibrant now than it was just a couple of months ago.\n\nThe national unemployment rate is at a very robust 3.5 percent. In New Jersey, the unemployment rate is 4 percent. The national rate is actually lower than what economists generally consider to be the natural unemployment rate. And indeed, there are still more job openings than there are available workers.\n\nNot surprisingly, this has resulted in significant upward pressure on wages. In many regions, smaller employers with thin margins are having a hard time filling entry-level positions. We’ve heard from community bankers that they can’t compete with larger banks for jobs like tellers. Near us, at the Jersey Shore, local businesses had a great summer in terms of sales, but they had a very hard time staying staffed. That’s partially because of higher salary demands but also because housing has become so expensive in that area that workers can’t afford to live there.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is also ticking up, a particularly welcome trend. Still, prime age women lag prime age men in workforce participation. To tackle that, we need to begin to address the cost of childcare, which has pushed far too many women out of work.\n\nFiscal policy has added to demand. The federal government pumped around $6 trillion into American households during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the amount of fiscal support provided by the federal government was significantly larger than the aggregate decline in GDP triggered by the pandemic in the first place.\n\nThe government’s aid was dispersed in a largely untargeted fashion. Mortgage forbearance and student loan forbearance — both offered to any borrowers, no questions asked, and, in the case of student loans, applied automatically — and direct stimulus payments to tens of millions of households were boons to Americans’ bank accounts. Importantly, they were policy decisions taken during a frightening and uncertain time. But they have certainly contributed to the high levels of demand we are still seeing.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAnd finally, expansive monetary policy — that’s us — kept the cost of capital low for long.\n\nThroughout most of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and enacted a major asset-buying program. These policies stoked demand, which they were designed to do.\n\nAs a central bank, the Federal Reserve can do little to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation. And as I have indicated, those problems, unfortunately, will take time to resolve.\n\nBut the Federal Reserve can absolutely affect demand, and that is what we are doing. We want to see inflation coming down steadily and consistently, and we also want to see it abating across a wide array of goods and services. The goal is to adjust conditions so that demand better matches supply.\n\nWe have two primary tools for implementing monetary policy: the federal funds rate — usually just thought of as interest rates — and our balance sheet.\n\nSince last fall, we have been tightening financial conditions. That process, at least as the market interpreted it, started last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper our asset purchases. Instead, simply announcing that we would soon begin to taper our asset purchases caused two-year Treasury yields to rise.\n\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. In fact, we are now reducing our balance sheet. We are shedding $60 billion in Treasuries and $35 billion in agency debt and mortgage-backed securities each month. Which is to say, we are removing a significant amount of financial accommodation quite rapidly.\n\nWe have also raised the federal funds rate 300 basis points since the start of 2022. That means the Fed is actively trying to slow the economy. But we are going to keep raising rates for a while. Given our frankly disappointing lack of progress on curtailing inflation, I expect we will be well above 4 percent by the end of the year.\n\nSometime next year, we are going to stop hiking rates. At that point, I think we should hold at a restrictive rate for a while to let monetary policy do its work. It will take a while for the higher cost of capital to work its way through the economy.\n\nAfter that, if we have to, we can tighten further, based on the data. But we should let the system work itself out. And we also need to recognize that this will take time: Inflation is known to shoot up like a rocket and then come down like a feather.\n\nAbove all, I want to stress that we must remain data dependent and flexible on policy. What we really need to see is a sustained decline in a number of inflation indicators before we let up on tightening monetary policy.\n\nAnd again, we need to make sure inflation expectations don’t become unanchored. One hopeful sign is that our banker contacts have been telling us that many customers are opting for adjustable-rate mortgages. Another lender, who issues mortgages for properties at the Jersey Shore, told us that even wealthier buyers are starting to balk and are waiting for rates to come down before buying a new home. That’s good news because it means borrowers expect inflation — and rates — to come down in the relatively near future.\n\nSo, what does all this mean for the economy? I expect that economic growth will moderate this year as both inflation and tightening financial conditions begin to crimp consumption. Overall, I forecast flat GDP growth for 2022, 1.5 percent growth in 2023, and around 2 percent growth in 2024.\n\nInflation will come down, but it will take some time to get to our target. I expect PCE inflation to come in at around 6 percent in 2022, around 4 percent next year, and 2.5 percent in 2024.\n\nTurning to the job market, the unemployment rate should peak next year at 4.5 percent as financial conditions bite. It should then fall to 4 percent in 2024, which suggests that even as we tighten monetary policy, labor markets will stay quite healthy.\n\nIn sum, the Federal Reserve is taking on inflation from a position of relative economic strength. Our goal of stable prices and maximum employment is achievable, and our resolve is strong.\n\nThank you very much for having me. Let’s get to your questions.",

            "content": "Hello, everyone! It’s great to be here with so many impressive leaders from higher education, business, and civic organizations. This is a fantastic program, and I’m sure you all are making valuable connections.\n\nIt’s also great to be here in Greensboro. Although I have to say, if I eat any more Carolina barbecue on this trip, they’re going to have to take me out on a stretcher …\n\nI’m here today to talk about the vital role that higher education institutions and hospitals — sometimes called eds and meds — play in their communities and local economies. As a Fed president, and before that the leader of a large public university and dean of a business school, I saw firsthand the sizable impact these institutions have.\n\nAnd speaking of being a Fed president, before I go any further, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAnchor Institutions and Their Impact\n\nNow, I would say it’s no coincidence that we are meeting today on a university campus. Even though they’ve made sizable leaps in their use of technology in recent years — especially during the COVID-19 pandemic — higher education institutions and hospitals are physically embedded in their communities.\n\nIn fact, that’s one of the reasons we call them anchor institutions. In multiple ways, eds and meds are tied to a specific place. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing facilities, or sports teams that can pick up and move — apologies to anybody from Oakland joining us today — higher education institutions and hospitals stay where they are. You quite literally can’t take the Greensboro out of UNC‒Greensboro.\n\nThere are also specific attributes that anchor these institutions in their communities. For one, higher education institutions and hospitals tend to be labor intensive, meaning they are often among the largest employers in their regions. In fact, health care is the largest single employment category in the United States, with more than 16 million people working in the field.\n\nEds and meds also serve as bulwarks against the ups and downs of the business cycle. Enrollment in colleges and universities, for instance, is countercyclical, meaning that when the economy slows, more people go to school, boosting anchor institutions. Hospitals are also recession resistant. After all, people require medical care no matter how the local economy is faring. All of this suggests that regions with strong anchor institutions may have more durable economies than those without.\n\nAnd in recent years, we’ve also seen anchor institutions take an increasing interest in building up the areas they serve. They are typically critical partners in community development initiatives as part of their missions. We’ve seen more hospitals and universities invest in neighborhood economic development, boosting local commercial corridors, seeding residential real estate development, and building neighborhood amenities, like parks. I don’t know how many of you get to Philadelphia, but the next time you do, make sure to check out University City, near the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. That neighborhood is now quite literally unrecognizable from what it was like when I was an undergrad, which, to be fair, was back in the Stone Age.\n\nThe impact of anchor institutions goes beyond the immediate. This is a key point that I really want to stress. Fundamentally, anchor institutions stimulate growth through innovation, commercialization, new venture formation, and talent attraction. In that sense, they can drive long-term economic development and growth.\n\nI see this in Philadelphia all the time. The talent and research coming out of our universities and health-care systems has led to the creation of a booming biotechnology industry. Our real estate developers can’t put up wet lab space fast enough, and our labs are hiring new grads straight out of school. Which is to say, anchor institutions are not only often the largest employers themselves in regions, they’re also the producers of talent that other businesses need.\n\nRisks\n\nWhen I give speeches on the country’s economic outlook, I often speak about downside risks. So I would be remiss if I did not mention that there are risks to regions with economies that rely heavily on anchor institutions because there are risks to these institutions themselves.\n\nEds and meds are both being radically disrupted by technology, demographic shifts, and increasing costs. As I alluded to earlier, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated both telehealth and remote learning. This has certainly created opportunities for health systems and universities to expand their markets, but it also loosened the place-based nature of their services. All of a sudden, these anchors are, frankly, a little less anchored. One stark example of this is Arizona State University, where half of enrolled undergraduates now attend class online. The economic consequences of this for regions are obvious: If students and patients don’t have to reside near or travel to anchor institutions for education or health care, students’ and patients’ dollars won’t travel either.\n\nDemographics are another downside risk, though with disparate impacts for universities and hospitals. With falling birth rates, fewer 18-year-olds are heading to college — and even fewer will enroll in the future, especially if immigrant rates remain depressed, as they are now. This demographic shift is most apparent in the Northeast and Midwest, which also happen to have higher concentrations of colleges and universities. That raises real questions about the viability of many of these institutions in the future — and the impact on communities.\n\nOn the other hand, an aging population will require more health care, boosting hospitals. Even here, however, the picture is mixed, as many hospitals have closed, or soon will, in rural regions with declining populations.\n\nMeanwhile, the ever-rising cost of education and health care means that more people may be priced out of accessing eds and meds altogether, which is both a humanitarian concern and an economic one.\n\nIntroducing the Anchor Economy Dashboard\n\nAt this point, I think it’s obvious why the Fed is interested in anchor institutions: They are often the largest employers in regions, they’re the producers of talent that other businesses need, and they lay the foundation for durable economic growth. That’s why, at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve developed what we call the Anchor Economy Dashboard, a new tool that quantifies the impact that higher education institutions and hospitals have on more than 500 regions across the country.\n\nFor each of these regions, the dashboard calculates the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, or induced — supported by local eds and meds institutions. Direct jobs comprise those employed directly by anchor institutions, such as doctors, nurses, and college professors. Indirect jobs are those in fields that directly support anchor institutions, like IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are those that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks working at those restaurants near campus on Tate Street have induced jobs.\n\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance index for each region. The reliance index provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional economy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and incorporates measures of impact in employment, income, and gross value added. A reliance index of 1 means a region’s reliance on anchor institutions is at the national average — below that means it’s less reliant, and above that means it’s more reliant.\n\nOn a national scale, the dashboard clearly shows what I’ve been talking about: The economic impact of anchor institutions is massive, with 9 percent of total U.S. employment, 6.3 percent of total U.S. income, and 8.1 percent of total U.S. gross value added from higher education institutions and hospitals. That translates to about 18 million jobs, $1.1 trillion in income, and $1.7 trillion in goods and services in gross value added to the economy.\n\nAnd now, let’s do something cool and look at the data for a few of the 524 metro areas in the dashboard.\n\nLet’s begin with where we are — Greensboro.\n\nAs we can see, in the Greensboro‒High Point area, around 41,000 jobs, $2.3 billion in income, and $3.3 billion in gross value added are produced by eds and meds. That equates to about 8.4 percent of the region’s employment, 6.6 percent of its income, and 7.8 percent of its gross value added. All of this amounts to a reliance index of 0.98 percent — almost exactly average for the country.\n\nNow, as you’ll see, an amazing feature of the dashboard is that it allows you to compare regions head to head. So let’s take a look at how Greensboro stacks up with two of its competitor regions: Greenville, South Carolina, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Thank you for not booing at their mention.\n\nAs you can see, Greenville has slightly higher figures for employment, income, and gross value added than Greensboro. But its reliance index is basically on par with Greensboro, at exactly average. Chattanooga has significantly lower total figures and a lower reliance index.\n\nNext, let’s take a look at the Durham‒Chapel Hill area, just down I-40 from here. As we can see, those are some big numbers. More than 100,000 jobs, $7 billion in income, and more than $10 billion in gross value added comes from local anchor institutions. That amounts to nearly a quarter of the area’s jobs and more than a fifth of its income and gross value added. And the area’s reliance index is truly eyepopping at 2.86, nearly three times the national average.\n\nLast, because I’m a bit biased, let’s take a peek at Philadelphia.\n\nAs you can see, the gross totals are large, owing to the region’s huge population. But the reliance index is above average, too, indicating that the Philadelphia area is more reliant than most of the country on eds and meds.\n\nOK, honestly, I could use this tool all day. And I suspect many of you could as well — so please go to philadelphiafed.org to delve into the dashboard.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’m really proud of our dashboard and excited for all the work to come. I’d also like to commend Deborah Diamond, director of the Anchor Economy Initiative, for her stellar work. These data really serve as a foundation for forthcoming research and discussion that will advance crucial conversations about challenges and opportunities of anchor-based economies. In fact, we are going to have one of those conversations now.\n\nSo, thanks again for having me. It’s an honor and a delight to be here with all of you.",

            "content": "Good morning! I’d like to begin by giving a big welcome to everyone here in Philadelphia and to those of you joining us virtually. One of the benefits of hosting a hybrid conference like this is that we derive the advantages of being together physically — I’ve had some of my best ideas on the sidelines of conferences like these — while also being able to welcome many people who couldn’t make it to Philadelphia.\n\nIt’s great that we have such a huge turnout today. I think that’s a testament not only to the growing interest in the subject we are here to discuss — fintech — but also to the stellar lineup that we’ve assembled for this, the Philadelphia Fed’s Sixth Annual Fintech Conference. My colleague Julapa Jagtiani, the organizer of these proceedings, has truly done it again. If you’ve never been to one of our fintech conferences before, trust me, you’re in for a treat. Over the next two days, we will hear from the leading voices in industry, government, and the Fed.\n\nAnd speaking of the Fed, here is where I give my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOur last fintech conference was in November 2021, and although that wasn’t even a year ago, I think it’s safe to say that conditions for the fintech industry — not to speak of the broader economy — have changed dramatically.\n\nI’ll give one example. Last November, I spoke about the rapid growth of buy now, pay later firms, which effectively repurposed Kmart’s old layaway model for the digital age. With buy now, pay later, shoppers are able to divide payments for purchases into a series of installments — sometimes with zero interest tacked on. And unlike with layaway, consumers benefit from getting the product up front and paying for it over time. This has proved a popular option, with buy now, pay later representing $2 of every $100 spent on e-commerce in 2021.\n\nBuy now, pay later looked robust in a low-interest rate environment. That’s because the vast majority of firms in the space have no deposits to tap. Instead, they borrow money that they then turn around and lend. Typically, their revenue comes from fees charged to merchants.\n\nRising rates have drastically changed the landscape for buy now, pay later. Forced to borrow at higher rates, these firms are facing pressures they simply weren’t last November. Unsurprisingly, major operators in the space have retrenched, with one of the leading lenders shedding 10 percent of its workforce last month.\n\nThe fintech landscape is changing rapidly as a result of macroeconomic conditions. Significant developments are occurring, and we’re lucky to have so many superb panelists here this week to discuss them.\n\nThe adoption of buy now, pay later has important implications for offering financial services to low- and moderate-income consumers or others who may be locked out of more traditional means of obtaining credit. Consider a young adult in her first job who has no established credit history and therefore can’t get approved for a bank credit card. She can now use buy now, pay later to finance that important purchase. Moreover, some buy now, pay later lenders report payment histories to credit bureaus, allowing these new borrowers to begin to build a credit history.\n\nOr think about the family that declared bankruptcy several years ago and that continues to be charged high rates on traditional forms of lending, even though they’re back on their financial feet. Buy now, pay later offers an alternate method of accessing credit.\n\nA survey from the Philadelphia Fed of buy now, pay later users in the United States found that users are generally non-White, lower earning, and younger than users of other payment methods like debit and credit cards.\n\nFintech, in other words, can help foster financial inclusion. That’s undeniable. But that is far from inevitable.\n\nLike all tools, fintech can be used for good, ill, or somewhere in between. Just as fintech can foster frictionless legitimate transactions, for instance, it can foster frictionless fraudulent transactions as well. Fraud is an example of where a little bit of friction can be a good thing.\n\nFintech has developed a lot over the six years we’ve been hosting these conferences, and the discussions like those we will have over the next two days have moved out of the largely theoretical and evermore into the realm of the empirical. We have increasingly rich data sets here in the United States and abroad that provide important insights on how fintech is reshaping credit markets.\n\nTake one example: A recent paper examined how fintech lending differed from traditional bank lending in China during the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Analyzing the dispersal of unsecured personal loans by three large fintech firms and a large commercial bank, the researchers found that fintechs were more likely than banks to extend credit to new and financially constrained borrowers. Fintech borrowers were more likely to be unemployed, to earn lower incomes, and to have had prior delinquencies.\n\nA happy story, right? Well, not quite.\n\nThat’s because it turns out that the delinquency rate of fintech loans tripled after the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas there was no significant change in the delinquency rate for bank loans over the same period. This is a puzzling finding, somehow suggesting that, in this case at least, fintech lenders were unable to accurately predict borrowers’ financial health in the event of a pandemic, but commercial banks were. That strongly implies that the Chinese fintech firms were operating with imperfect or insufficient information about their borrowers. While issuing credit to the financially constrained is potentially beneficial, it does no good to the lenders or the borrowers if the loans end up delinquent.\n\nBut this is hardly an iron law: Other examples have found fintech loans going delinquent at lower rates than bank loans. That suggests that elevated or lower credit risk is not necessarily inherent to fintech itself, but rather dependent on each firm’s particular business model.\n\nAnother recent paper that examines unsecured small business loans in India offers an important example. There, the authors found, when fintechs used a more holistic method for evaluating borrowers’ credit risk than a simple credit score, both borrowers and lenders benefited.\n\nOver several years, small businesses in India seeking credit from fintechs agreed to share data on their so-called cashless payments, certified checks, Internet banking, mobile banking, point-of-sale transactions, and money transfers on mobile apps. The upshot? They gained access to larger loans at lower rates than those who used traditional credit scores to access credit.\n\nOne can imagine such a model working here in the U.S., where the credit constrained are able to demonstrate their creditworthiness in ways besides their credit scores. In my opinion, there is no good reason that on-time rent and utility payments should not be just as determinative in obtaining credit as on-time payments for car loans or credit cards.\n\nAgain, the opportunities to use fintech to reach the economically constrained and financially marginalized are truly exciting — and very important. It’s now on all of us to seize them.\n\nSo again, thank you so much for joining us. We have a very rich menu of programming over the next two days, which I’m sure we will all benefit from.\n\nI’ll now turn things over to David Mills, my colleague from the Board of Governors, who will lead a discussion on the future of payments.",

            "content": "Hello, everyone! It’s great to be back with this group that I last addressed about a year and a half ago. A lot has changed since we were last together, I will say! I’m looking forward to talking a little bit about the economic outlook, inflation, and monetary policy, and some recent Philadelphia Fed research on the job market. Then I will be glad to field some of your questions.\n\nOne thing that has not changed since last we met is the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile I was preparing for this meeting, I took a look at my notes from our last discussion. When I say things have changed a lot since January 2021, I think you’ll see what I mean.\n\nThen, 2 percent of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Today, 67 percent are, and highly effective new treatments for the disease have been developed as well.\n\nThen, the national unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. Today, it is 3.6 percent, and there are 11.5 million unfilled jobs.\n\nThen, we had just concluded a year in which inflation came in at 1.2 percent, well below the Fed’s target of 2 percent. Today, we are dealing with annualized inflation of 8.3 percent.\n\nInflation\n\nHigh inflation is a scourge, punishing low- and moderate-income families the most. Even though wages are rising, they are not keeping up with the pace of gains in the cost of living. This is an urgent problem.\n\nInflation is a result of two factors: supply and demand.\n\nOn the supply side, COVID-19 lockdowns — still ongoing in parts of China as we speak — have badly damaged supply chains. Semiconductors, present in everything from automobiles to washing machines, are hard to come by as factories have shuttered for extended periods and international ports have clogged. The unavoidable result of shortages? Higher prices.\n\nGovernment policies — and I evince no position on whether these are wise on balance — have undeniably contributed to price gains. The U.S. government slaps tariffs on everything from Chinese-made televisions to Canadian lumber, spiking prices. Sanctions imposed on Russia after its tragic and outrageous invasion of Ukraine have reduced energy and commodity supplies. Unfortunately, I think elevated energy prices could be with us for a while. A two-year “pause” in legal immigration has contributed to labor shortages. And housing costs are up, not just because of pricier materials and labor, but also because we are not building enough houses to keep up with demand. This is often a result of local government policies that stymie construction.\n\nOn the demand side, Americans have money to spend. Nominal wages are rising, thanks to our tight labor market. Fiscal policy pumped trillions of dollars into households during the worst periods of the pandemic. And accommodative monetary policy — that’s us — has kept the cost of capital low. Throughout the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept rates near zero and embarked on a major asset-buying program.\n\nIt should go without saying that, as a central bank, there is little the Federal Reserve can do to affect the supply constraints pushing up inflation. But we can affect demand — and that is what we have begun to do.\n\nThe tightening, at least as the market interpreted it, began last September, even before we began to move the federal funds rate or taper our asset purchases. My colleague Fed Governor Chris Waller pointed out in a recent speech that, after the FOMC’s September 2021 statement, which indicated as forward guidance that we would soon begin tapering our asset purchases, two-year Treasury yields began to rise. Again, this was before we had actually taken any action; it was simply a result of our forward guidance.\n\nThe taper began in earnest last November and is now complete. We have also raised the federal funds rate 75 basis points since the start of the new year. Beginning on June 1, we will start to reduce our balance sheet.\n\nGoing forward, if there are no significant changes in the data in the coming weeks, I expect two additional 50 basis point rate hikes in June and July. After that, I anticipate a sequence of increases in the funds rate at a measured pace until we are confident that inflation is moving toward the Committee’s inflation target. This will be dependent on where the data are. Because I can tell you this: One thing that has not changed since last January is the generally elevated level of uncertainty about our current economic path. Reality has a way of interceding — and at no time has that been more apparent than over the past two years.\n\nOverall, despite a contraction in the first quarter, I expect growth of about 3 percent this year. Underlying demand growth remains strong, and the job market should stay tight through 2022.\n\nThe Job Market for Non-College Workers\n\nNow I’d like to turn to the labor market and share some recent research from the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nI’d like to begin by asking you to think back to what things were like before the pandemic. I know this can be a challenge — it certainly is for me.\n\nIn general, the economy was quite healthy before COVID-19 struck, with solid GDP growth and low unemployment. But those headline numbers masked serious problems, most notably in the labor market. Many prime age workers, particularly men, and especially men without college degrees, had dropped out of the labor force altogether — so they didn’t show up in the unemployment data. Many more Americans were essentially “stuck” — they may have been working, but they had jobs with stagnant wages and minimal opportunities for advancement.\n\nA big focus of ours at the Philadelphia Fed has been working to get more of these workers into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that don’t require a college degree and that pay above the median wage. We even developed an interactive tool called the Occupational Mobility Explorer, which demonstrates that many workers in lower-wage employment already possess the skills they need to transition to a higher-paying job with just a little bit of training. You simply input your job and your metro area into the tool, and the Explorer suggests available career paths. A bill collector, for instance, could become a credit counselor and enjoy a significant bump in wages. I urge you to delve into the Occupational Mobility Explorer at Philadelphiafed.org.\n\nIn recent months, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer another important question: How did the pandemic affect workers without college degrees?\n\nInitially, of course, it was those workers who suffered the worst effects of the pandemic-induced recession. Workers without college degrees were less likely to be able to work from home and were more likely to work in industries that were shut down either by government order or because of COVID-19 outbreaks. The huge spike in unemployment we experienced in 2020 — at its peak, the unemployment nearly quadrupled — was disproportionately concentrated among those without college degrees and those in lower-wage work.\n\nBut what happened to those workers when the economy reopened?\n\nBy June 2021, job openings were at record highs as a variety of factors kept workers on the sidelines, even as consumer demand surged. Employers deployed all kinds of methods to lure workers. They, for instance, offered increased flexibility and training and bumped up starting salaries. These were favorable trends for workers.\n\nExamining a data set of job postings, Philadelphia Fed researchers identified another trend favorable to workers without a college degree, in particular: The minimum level of education required in the online job market fell modestly, even after controlling for the postings’ broad occupation and sector classifications. In other words, some job postings that before the pandemic might have required a college degree no longer did.\n\nAll told, compared with the five quarters preceding the pandemic, the five quarters following its onset included an additional 2.3 million “opportunity employment” job postings. You’ll recall that these are jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree and that pay at least the median wage. These additional postings can be attributed to both the greater volume of job postings for these types of jobs at 62 percent and the lower educational requirements, at 38 percent of the increase. Which is to say, a lot of job openings that might have been previously off-limits to someone without a college degree became viable options after the start of the pandemic.\n\nThis is clearly a salutary trend, and we should all be thinking of ways to build on it. Uncertainty, if nothing else, can breed opportunities to build a better economy that works for all Americans.\n\nSo, thanks again for having me back. And now let’s get to some questions.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s really great to be back at the University of Delaware for this terrific event. It was wonderful to see so many old friends and to make some new ones at dinner last night. And also, thank you for the lavish breakfast spread this morning. Although since so many of you are health-care workers, I have to admit I was a little self-conscious when I was filling my plate; I hid my two — OK, three — slices of bacon under my fruit, hoping you all wouldn’t notice.\n\nBut seriously, thanks so much for having me back in Delaware. It’s always a treat to be on campus because it allows to me to slip back into professor mode. And that’s what I intend to do this morning, though if I recall correctly, the 9:00 a.m. slot was always a little challenging to navigate as a professor. But I’ll do my best to keep you all awake — and if not, well, the coffee station is over there.\n\nI’m going to spend the next few minutes discussing health care as an economic driver. Then, I’ll be happy to take some questions. But before I do, I need to give you what we call the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Changing Economy\n\nI had a chance to walk around the STAR campus yesterday and quite frankly — was amazed at what I saw. Like some of you, I remember when there used to be a Chrysler factory here. I also remember — painfully — when after the 2008 financial crisis, there was a shuttered Chrysler factory here. That was a terrible time.\n\nI was president of UD when the Chrysler plant closed, and I was intimately involved in the university’s decision to purchase the land. But I have to say, what I saw yesterday surpassed even my own optimistic expectations for what would happen to the ground I am standing on. This is now a thriving, mixed-use community where academia, industry, and government are collaborating to perform pathbreaking research focused on clean energy, biotechnology, and, of course, health sciences, among other fields. Instead of Durangos, this area now produces innovations in health care. The “phoenix rising from the ashes” may be an overused metaphor in our culture, but I think it describes best what has happened here.\n\nIn a way, I would argue, the STAR campus serves as a metaphor for transitions occurring across our entire country. Traditional manufacturing remains an important component of our economy, but its relative share of employment is declining. This is an extraordinarily painful transition for millions of our fellow Americans and for communities across the country. More must be done to support workers, their families, and their communities as the economy changes.\n\nAnd change it most certainly has, with the growth of the health-care economy leading the way. In 1960, total national expenditure on health care represented about 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). By 1990, that figure was up to 12 percent. Today, about a fifth of our GDP is composed of health-care spending. Health-care outlays are also the federal government’s number one category of spending.\n\nThe growth of the health-care sector is evident in employment data as well. In 1990, about 8 million Americans worked in health care; that figure has since doubled to 16 million. That’s the largest single employment segment in our economy.\n\nIn other words, the tragic experience of the last two years demonstrated not only how important the health-care sector is to our national fabric, it is extraordinarily important to our economy as well.\n\nA number of factors account for health care’s growing share of national spending. Some are salutary. More Americans have health insurance and thus are able to access — and spend on — care. Life-saving technologies and therapies have been developed. And the country’s population is aging, a reflection, in part, of longer life spans. As people get older, they tend to spend more on health care. That is something I can personally attest to, as I’ve had a number of foot surgeries over the past couple of years as a result of football injuries I suffered decades ago. Moreover, if other products become cheaper, then the national share of health-care spending will, naturally, rise. That is to say, as agriculture became more productive, the relative percent of spending on health care has risen.\n\nBut other cost drivers are less desirable. The extremely tight supply of physicians in the United States keeps costs high, for instance. As a Fed president, I stay studiously neutral on political matters, and as a former UD president, I remain neutral on the fact that Delaware is one of only four states without a medical school. But it is a fact that Delaware has relatively few doctors to serve its population, and it is an iron law of economics that when supply is constrained, prices rise. Delaware has a relatively old population, too, which drives demand for health-care services.\n\nAnchor Institutions\n\nWith all this said, there can be no doubt that what we call eds and meds — colleges, universities, and nonprofit medical institutions — drive economic activity. These institutions are often referred to as anchor institutions because of the multiple ways they are tied to a place. Unlike corporate headquarters, manufacturing facilities, or sports franchises that can pick up and move — sorry Raiders fans — higher-education institutions and hospitals may sometimes close, but they aren’t going anywhere. As we have seen, health care is labor intensive, making medical institutions some of the largest employers in their regions. And they are generally recession resistant. This part is crucial, too: The research and development functions of higher-education institutions and medical institutions generate new businesses through innovation, technology transfer, and commercialization. In fact, we are seeing that all over the Philadelphia region right now.\n\nOK, now I’m going to break a little bit of news.\n\nIn the coming months, the Philadelphia Fed is going to launch what we are calling the Anchor Economy Dashboard. I’m really excited about this. The Anchor Economy Dashboard will be a new, first-ever, national data set that captures the importance of anchor institutions to their regional economies. For the purposes of the dashboard, anchor institutions include higher-education institutions and hospitals. While the dashboard is not live yet, we have the data underlying it, and I’d like to share some with you today.\n\nThe State of Delaware has 38 anchor institutions, encompassing both eds and meds. Employment impacts from Delaware eds and meds total 65,316 jobs. That’s the total number of jobs — direct, indirect, and induced — supported by higher education and hospitals in the state.\n\nDirect jobs comprise those employed directly by anchor institutions; indirect are those working in fields that directly support anchor institutions, for example, IT contractors supporting a hospital. And induced jobs are those that are supported by the economic activity that anchor economies generate. The folks working over at Klondike Kate’s have jobs that are induced by UD.\n\nOne thing that makes the Anchor Economy Dashboard so neat is that it also calculates a reliance score for each region. The reliance score provides a summary measure of how dependent a regional economy is on anchor institutions. It adjusts economic impact by the size of the regional economy and incorporates measures of impact in terms of employment, income, and gross value added.\n\nFor Delaware, our data support what I suspect a lot of us know intuitively: This state is quite reliant on anchor institutions. So, while Delaware’s total employment in eds and meds ranks 46th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia, that is largely a result of the state having a small population. Delaware’s reliance score, we calculate, is 1.23. In other words, Delaware overindexes on eds and meds employment, income and gross value added, compared with other regions. Delaware is 23 percent more dependent on eds and meds for jobs, income, and gross value added than the United States as a whole.\n\nBy comparison, Pennsylvania is ranked 15th in reliance at 1.19 and 863,974 total jobs attributable to eds and meds. New Jersey is ranked 25th in reliance at 1.05 and 569,467 total jobs attributable to eds and meds. In other words, New Jersey is almost perfectly average, which pains me as a South Jersey boy to admit. Montana has the highest reliance score at 1.53, with total employment impact from eds and meds at 87,128 anchor institution jobs.\n\nAnd while I, again, remain neutral on the fact that the State of Delaware does not have a medical school, the data clearly demonstrate how economically impactful having one can be for a region. Take Hershey, Pennsylvania, which has hosted Penn State’s medical school since 1967. The Harrisburg metropolitan statistical area (MSA), which encompasses Hershey, has a total population of 587,291, about half the size of the State of Delaware. But the total employment impact of eds and meds for the Harrisburg MSA is 48,338 — 74 percent of the employment impact in Delaware. Not surprisingly, Harrisburg’s reliance score is 1.45, indicating that the region overindexes on eds and meds jobs, income, and gross value added compared with the rest of the country.\n\nThe Anchor Economy Dashboard will be launching on our website — philadelphiafed.org — in the coming months, and if you’re anything like me, you’ll look forward to spending many hours delving into the data.\n\nThere is a lot to think about: Regions rich with anchor institutions have benefited from the way these institutions fortify the economy and support community development. But economic dependence on anchor institutions may increasingly come with risks as technology disrupts health care. The pandemic, for instance, accelerated telehealth, creating opportunities for health-care institutions but also loosening the “anchor” that hospitals have traditionally represented. There’s a lot to ponder today — and in the weeks, months, and years ahead.\n\nSo, again, thanks so much for having me. Refill that coffee! And now I’m happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "Good evening! It’s really great to be here, a mere two years after we had initially planned to do this. The pandemic kept us apart for far too long, and I’m thrilled that we are finally together. So, thanks so much for having me.\n\nThe theme of this talk is “Where We’re Going, Where We’ve Been” — so I’m going to begin way, way back at the beginning. I want to talk a little about what the Fed is and what it does. I also want to discuss what the Fed doesn’t do, because I have to admit our powers are overestimated sometimes. I’ll then discuss the current economic situation and a little bit about the job market. Then we can move to a Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nBut before I can do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLet’s start with where we’ve been.\n\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of the man who in recent years has become everybody’s favorite founding father: Alexander Hamilton. The bank was located in Philadelphia when it was still the capital of the country. It was established in 1791 to deal with the debt from the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different than the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy.\n\nAs Broadway has reminded us, Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was too strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than standing armies. When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the Jeffersonian argument won out and the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate. The bank was dissolved.\n\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we launched the imaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And 20 years after that, Congress decided not to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful, centralized institutions.\n\nBut not having a central bank didn’t really work because it tended to breed volatility.\n\nThe period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was marked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan actually had to step in personally to bail out the country. If you’ve ever been to the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, you can stand in the room where the solution to that financial crisis was worked out.\n\nEven during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in democracies, and it remains that way today. There are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual adoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent inevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized structure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise. It also reflects the unique demands of the United States and our economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional Banks located around the country, including the one I oversee in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and board of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area. Fundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues that make the region tick. You and I are in the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District, geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\n\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but we’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the ground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Lawrence Township than they do in Dallas, Salt Lake City, or Honolulu. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\n\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such a big country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger populations, and no one country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast, spreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations don’t.\n\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\n\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single goal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\n\nMaximum employment encompasses a wide range of metrics, although most attention is paid to the unemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor markets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Price stability, on the other hand, is low and stable inflation, which we judge to be around 2 percent a year. More on both of these topics in a bit.\n\nThe decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are built entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate. It is our North Star.\n\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What, exactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we don’t do.\n\nWe have lending power. What that means is we do not have spending power. We have no authority over fiscal policy, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or grants to worthy organizations. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials, be they on the local, state, or national level.\n\nSo, what do we do?\n\nWe set monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies. We are the lender of last resort during bona fide emergencies.\n\nAnd the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest rates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have a truly exceptional team in Philadelphia in our Community Affairs department, and they work with partners all over the Third District. They’re doing truly vital work on employment, transportation, housing, and other issues. In fact, I’ll discuss some recent research from this department a little later.\n\nBut first, let me talk a bit about monetary policy. Monetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly conscripted set of tools.\n\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. More than anything, we’re tilling the land.\n\nMonetary policy is about meeting our dual mandate mostly by moving interest rates. There are other tools we use, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds rate. In the media, that’s usually just called the interest rate.\n\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate tends to influence interest rates more broadly, so the effect ripples through the economy. When we move the federal funds rate, it affects the interest rate people pay on their mortgages and car loans and that businesses pay to borrow to meet or expand their payrolls or buy inventory. In fact, sometimes just announcing we are planning to raise the federal funds rate in the future affects these lending rates.\n\nWe set rates when the FOMC meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year. After two years of virtual meetings, we’re finally back in person.\n\nRegional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three years, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, owing to the presence of Wall Street, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the System. And while the rest of us don’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion.\n\nThe FOMC discussion is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to swings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike politicians, who suffer the slings and arrows of the 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble. I truly believe that the independence of the Fed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the pressures of politics.\n\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered “independent within government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither Congress nor the presidential administration has a say in the decisions we make.\n\nThat’s not to suggest the Fed doesn’t come under intense political scrutiny at times, particularly when economic conditions are troubled. So now, I’d like to talk a little bit about where we are.\n\nWhen thinking about the state of the U.S. economy, I think it’s worth taking a step back and looking at the global situation. Sometimes when we’re immersed in granular data, it can be easy to miss the economic forest for the trees.\n\nSo, where are we?\n\nWell, first and foremost, we’ve made significant progress, particularly on vaccinations, but we remain mired in the midst of a now two-year global pandemic that has killed at least 6 million people globally and more than 1 million here in the United States. The human toll is immense and tragic, and the economic tribulations continue to reverberate. Tens of millions around the world were thrown out of work by the pandemic, and supply chains were throttled. Even now, there are significant issues getting supply chains back on line, which is contributing to high inflation that is harming American families.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has invaded Ukraine, fomenting death and destruction and spurring a humanitarian crisis in the heart of Europe.\n\nI have to say, given these extraordinarily trying and tragic circumstances, one can’t help but feel a little bit of awe at the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — GDP grew at an annualized rate of 7 percent, with a strong inventory investment and healthy demand for capital goods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent.\n\nWhile delivery times remain elevated, there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from our contacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing, at least somewhat. It really depends on what industry — or more specifically, what good — you are talking about. And shocks continue — witness the recent lockdowns in China.\n\nThe job market, half of the Fed’s mandate you’ll recall, is extremely robust. For 11 straight months, new job creation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re wrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated.\n\nNominal wage growth, as one would guess given these conditions, has been strong, though it has recently not kept up with inflation. Labor participation rates are edging up as well, though they remain below where they were before the pandemic. I suspect that the waning of the virus — at least here in the United States — as well as uncertain equity markets and even inflation may lure people back into the workforce and persuade others to delay retirement. I know some people my age who were thinking about retiring have recently decided to keep working. The unemployment rate, which is below 4 percent, should continue to fall this year.\n\nSo, I think it’s fair to say the Fed has met half of its dual mandate. But the other side of our mandate is proving more troublesome.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Inflation is running far too high. I am acutely concerned about this. Generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far higher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable with. I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) increased in March. Compared with a year ago, CPI is up 8.5 percent. The increase was driven, in part, by higher energy and food prices. Core CPI, which excludes energy and food prices, remains very high as well, having increased 6.5 percent in March from a year earlier. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.\n\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket.” Both goods and services are experiencing inflation.\n\nThis is why last month we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since 2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon. While the Fed cannot do much to ameliorate the supply issues that are increasing inflation, we can begin to affect demand.\n\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring commodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect to come in around 3 percent to 3.5 percent GDP growth this year — and then falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent during the next couple of years.\n\nInflation should begin to taper this year, too, though remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for 2022. The following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\n\nNow, before we move on to our Q&A — and, by the way, I hope you’ll really grill me — I want to talk a little bit about some recent research from the Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development function.\n\nKeeping with our theme, I’d like, once again, to start with where we’ve been. I know it can be tough to remember — it sure is for me — but let’s try to think back to what economic conditions were like prior to the pandemic.\n\nIn general, the economy was actually quite healthy before COVID-19 struck, with solid GDP growth and low unemployment. But those headline numbers masked serious problems, most notably in the labor market. Many prime age workers, particularly men, and especially men without college degrees, had dropped out of the labor force altogether — so they didn’t show up in unemployment data. Many more Americans were essentially “stuck” — they may have been working, but they had jobs with stagnant wages and minimal opportunities for advancement.\n\nA big focus of our Community Development function at the Philadelphia Fed has been working to get more of these workers into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that don’t require a college degree and that pay above the median wage. They even developed an interactive tool called the Occupational Mobility Explorer, which demonstrates that many workers in lower-wage employment already possess the skills they need to transition to a higher-paying job with just a little bit of training. You simply input your job and your metro area into the tool, and the Explorer suggests available career paths. A bill collector, for instance, could become a credit counselor and enjoy a significant bump in wages. I urge you to delve into the Occupational Mobility Explorer at Philadelphiafed.org.\n\nIn recent months, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer another important question: How did the pandemic affect workers without college degrees?\n\nInitially, of course, it was those workers who suffered the worst effects of the pandemic-induced recession. Workers without college degrees were less likely to be able to work from home and were more likely to work in industries that were shut down either by government order or because of COVID-19 outbreaks. The huge spike in unemployment we experienced in 2020 — at its peak, the unemployment nearly quadrupled — was disproportionately concentrated among those without college degrees and those in lower-wage work.\n\nBut what happened to those workers when the economy reopened?\n\nBy June 2021, job openings were at record highs as a variety of factors kept workers on the sidelines even as consumer demand surged. Employers deployed all kinds of methods to lure workers. They, for instance, offered increased flexibility and training and bumped up starting salaries. These were favorable trends for workers.\n\nExamining a data set of job postings, Philadelphia Fed researchers identified another trend favorable to workers without a college degree, in particular: The minimum level of education required in the online job market fell modestly, even after controlling for the postings’ broad occupation and sector classifications. In other words, some job postings that before the pandemic might have required a college degree no longer did.\n\nAll told, compared with the five quarters preceding the pandemic, the five quarters following its onset included an additional 2.3 million “opportunity employment” job postings. You’ll recall that these are jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree and that pay at least the median wage. These additional postings can be attributed to both the greater volume of job postings for these types of jobs at 62 percent and also the lower educational requirements, at 38 percent of the increase. Which is to say, a lot of job openings that might have been previously off-limits to someone without a college degree became viable options after the start of the pandemic.\n\nThis is clearly a salutary trend, and we should be thinking of ways to build on it. You, as future college graduates, will play a key role in building a new economy that works for everyone.\n\nSo, thanks again so much for having me. I hope it was worth the two-year wait. And now I’m happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "Hello! It’s great to be here again for what is becoming an annual tradition. I’m very much looking forward to today’s conversation. I plan to discuss the economic outlook, monetary policy, and a bit of research on housing from the Philadelphia Fed. And then we can have an open discussion.\n\nAnd now for another tradition: the standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Economy\n\nWhen I addressed this group almost exactly a year ago, I called the economic recovery, both nationally and here in Delaware, a “work in progress.”\n\nI think that still holds. Economic growth and employment are robust, but I’m very concerned about inflation.\n\nLet’s begin on the positive side of the ledger.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year — coinciding, at least in part, with the Omicron surge — national GDP grew at an annualized rate of 7 percent, with strong inventory investment and healthy demand for capital goods. For the totality of 2021, U.S. GDP growth was a very healthy 5.7 percent. That this occurred in the midst of a deadly pandemic is quite a testament to the underlying strength of our economy.\n\nJob growth, a key component of the Fed’s mandate, remains robust. For 11 straight months, new job creation has topped 400,000. But if you think that has led to a decline in Help Wanted signs, you’re wrong. Even with all this job creation, vacancy rates remain elevated, at a near record.\n\nNominal wage growth — as one would guess given these conditions — has been strong, though lately it has not been keeping up with inflation. Labor participation rates are edging up as well, though they remain below where they were before the pandemic. I suspect that the waning of the virus — at least here in the United States — as well as uncertain equity markets and even inflation may lure people back into the workforce and persuade others to delay retirement. The unemployment rate, which is below 4 percent, should continue to fall this year.\n\nIn Delaware, the recovery continues apace.\n\nThe unemployment rate is nearing pre-pandemic levels, overall gains in payroll employment have been steady, labor market conditions are tight, and the housing market remains hot. Consumer traffic to workplaces and other nonresidential locations has increased substantially, though transit use remains almost 40 percent below where it was prior to the pandemic.\n\nTotal employment in Delaware is now about 14,000 jobs below where it was when the pandemic struck. Job openings were at a historic high in January, the quits rate remains elevated, and layoffs are very low. Employment in financial services is where it was prior to COVID-19’s arrival, while leisure and hospitality employment remain somewhat depressed.\n\nA persistent problem in getting more people back into the labor force is the high cost and low availability of child care. The problems are acute here. To cite just one statistic, Delaware families spend about 20 percent of the median household’s income to care for one child, an unsustainable burden.\n\nMany of you are probably aware of the work that the Philadelphia Fed and the Delaware Chamber have been doing on this important issue, and I’d be happy to discuss this further during our Q&A.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this. The consumer price index (CPI) was up 10 percent annualized in February, led by another significant increase in energy prices. Over the past year, CPI is up 7.9 percent.\n\nCore CPI, stripping out energy and other volatile indicators, remains very high as well, with 6.2 percent annualized growth in February. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will add to inflation pressure, not only hiking oil and gas prices but other commodities, like wheat and fertilizer, as well.\n\nDelivery times remain elevated, and while there are some signs in the data, and in what we hear from our contacts, that supply chain constraints are finally easing, we are not out of the woods yet. In response to a new COVID-19 wave, China is instituting hard lockdowns in major manufacturing hubs, further choking supply.\n\nInflation is widespread. It is showing up throughout a vast array of goods that comprise the CPI “basket” — and among some of those that aren’t in the basket.\n\nThe bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply chain disruptions, and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far higher than I — and my colleagues on the FOMC — are comfortable with. I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\n\nThat is why last month we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since 2018. We raised our target by 25 basis points, and I expect a series of deliberate, methodical hikes as the year continues and the data evolve. I also anticipate that we will begin to reduce our holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities soon.\n\nWith the runoff of pandemic support, tightening monetary conditions, and the war in Ukraine pressuring commodity prices, I think growth will moderate this year. We can probably expect 3 percent to 3.5 percent GDP growth this year before falling to trend growth of 2 percent to 2.5 percent during the next couple of years.\n\nI do see the potential for a significant uptick in the service sector in many large cities that are only now waking up after a two-year pandemic-induced hibernation. Central business districts in cities like New York, San Francisco, and Philadelphia should get a boost as more workers return to their offices — the staff of the Philadelphia Fed included. The rise of hybrid work may moderate the potential for a huge boom, however. There is a big question mark hanging over the future of commercial real estate.\n\nInflation should begin to taper this year too — but remain elevated, probably around 4 percent for 2022. The following two years should bring it back to our target of 2 percent.\n\nAll of these forecasts, of course, are freighted with uncertainty.\n\nHousing\n\nNow, before we move to the open discussion, I’d like to turn to housing, which comprises a huge and vitally important sector of the U.S. economy. With a fairly weak public social safety net, for Americans, houses are not only their shelters — they are a significant source of their household wealth and retirement savings as well.\n\nIn general, the housing market is largely healthy; if anything, it’s not keeping up with demand.\n\nHousing starts are robust, but inventories are low and price growth is strong. Policies that make construction arduous in certain states and municipalities continue to impede efforts to meet demand. That degrades overall economic performance, because in many places, people cannot afford to live where the jobs are.\n\nNow I’d like to turn specifically to mortgage forbearance, a subject of important research from the staff of the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nAs many of you will recall, at the outset of the pandemic, the CARES Act mandated that borrowers of federally insured mortgages be granted forbearances. To ensure widespread take-up, the law said borrowers could be granted forbearances by simply requesting it; they did not even need to prove hardship. The upshot was that homeowners could temporarily pause their mortgage payments without penalty and stay in their homes, without negatively affecting their credit scores.\n\nThe CARES Act also put into place a foreclosure moratorium, followed by temporary protections against foreclosure. Private sector lenders adopted the same practices.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, as the pandemic began and the economy was shut down, Americans took this opportunity in droves. More than 8.5 million borrowers entered forbearance at some point during the pandemic — more than 15 percent of the total mortgage market.\n\nThat was then, though.\n\nAs of last month, the number of loans in forbearance had declined by more than 90 percent, down to around 680,000 mortgages.\n\nSo, what has become of the nearly 8 million households that entered forbearance and have since come out of it? Our researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking this and have made some important findings.\n\nI’ll begin with the positive news.\n\nNearly three-quarters of those who have exited forbearance have voluntarily paid off or are current, many making use of payment deferrals or loan modifications.\n\nFor borrowers able to resume timely payments, a deferral creates a no-interest subordinated lien out of their missed payments not due until loan payoff. Meanwhile, loan modifications offer lower interest rates and extend loan terms up to 40 years while offering payment reductions of 20 percent or more.\n\nMoreover, our exceptionally strong housing market has kept home prices elevated.\n\nWhile this has had undeniably negative impacts on those seeking to enter the housing market, it does ensure that borrowers can avoid losing their homes and that banks won’t suffer losses large enough to meaningfully affect their capital positions. Homeowners are sitting on more than $10 trillion of tappable equity — a record. The contrast with the Great Recession is remarkable; you’ll recall back then that nearly half of all distressed borrowers were “underwater.”\n\nStill, nearly 1 million mortgages are seriously delinquent, split evenly between those classified by servicers in loss mitigation and those not in loss mitigation. Most borrowers who remain seriously delinquent and not in loss mitigation never entered forbearance at all. Many were in nonpayment before the pandemic struck.\n\nAnd of the borrowers classified as being in loss mitigation, three-quarters are still in process and have not, as of yet, resumed timely payments on their mortgages. Black and Hispanic borrowers have much higher shares of nonpayment — either being in forbearance or delinquency. Interestingly, just as the unemployment rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels, the number of delinquent mortgages has also returned to pre-pandemic rates.\n\nLenders may want to consider solutions that limit the costs of modification while providing more payment relief to borrowers. One such solution is for the Federal Housing Administration to offer 40-year modifications. This will lower the cost relative to the 30-year option and provide more relief to borrowers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a 40-year mortgage modification for FHA loans, and we are currently in the midst of a 60-day comment period.\n\nIt’s worth noting now that protections against foreclosure expired on December 31, 2021, and foreclosure starts are back to their pre-pandemic levels too.\n\nI would like to say a couple of words about some research on mortgage refinances as well.\n\nRefinance mortgage originations grew remarkably in 2020 in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania — in fact, they vastly outpaced the growth in mortgages for new home purchases. A lot of that we owe, of course, to the extraordinary circumstances we found ourselves in that year: Mortgage interest rates fell to historic lows as the economy was shuttered, keeping people where they were.\n\nBut my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed have found, while refinances were popular during this period, the growth rate for refinanced mortgages for Black and low- and moderate-income borrowers was only about half to three-quarters of the growth rate for borrowers overall.\n\nWhat’s instructive is that the lower rate of refinances was not solely because of higher denial rates, though historically those communities have been denied at higher rates.\n\nRather, our Bank researchers found refinance applications from Black and low- and moderate-income borrowers grew at a much slower rate than applicants overall. That suggests a need for improved communication from banks to Black and low- and moderate-income households. Unfortunately, many homeowners missed out on some significant savings they could have enjoyed if they had refinanced. We should think of ways to make sure these communication breakdowns do not happen again.\n\nSo, thanks again for having me. I’m sure the next time we convene, more progress will have been made. Now let’s open things up for discussion.",

I’m also worried that inflation expectations could become unmoored.\n\nWhich is why last week we announced we were raising the federal funds rate for the first time since 2018.

To ensure widespread take-up, the law said borrowers could be granted forbearances by simply requesting it; they did not even need to prove hardship.

While the Department of Housing and Urban Development has proposed a program to facilitate a 40-year mortgage, it has yet to materialize. It’s worth noting now that protections against foreclosure expired on December 31, 2021, and foreclosure starts are back to their pre-pandemic levels too.\n\nMoney Market Funds and COVID-19\n\nNow, I’m certain you’re eager to grill me, but I want to close with a few words on what happened with money market funds (MMFs) almost exactly two years ago, just as the pandemic struck. I realize this is not a happy memory, so apologies for bringing this up. COVID-19 may have been a true black swan event — and we all fervently hope, a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience – but that must not preclude us from drawing lessons that we can use going forward.\n\nMarch 2020, you’ll recall, was characterized by a dash for cash. (It was also characterized by a dash for toilet paper and hand sanitizer, but that is a story for another day.) Net outflows from prime MMFs, which provide crucial investment in various forms of short-term debt, was more than 17 percent — roughly equivalent to the outflows experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. All told, more than $140 billion evaporated from domestic MMFs between March 6 and March 26, 2020.\n\nAs you can imagine, this run on MMFs imposed huge pressure on the kinds of short-term funding that companies rely on to stay afloat. The consequences for financial stability, and the U.S. economy at large, were profound.\n\nSo, for the second time in 12 years, a significant outflow from MMFs ensured a concerted policy response. The Fed, in conjunction with the Treasury Department, stepped in, and on March 18, 2020, we announced we were launching the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, which was formally initiated on March 23. Ultimately, 47 out of 95 domestic prime MMFs accessed the facility.\n\nWhat’s important to note is that as soon as we announced the advent of the liquidity fund, outflows from MMFs declined substantially. From March 23 to the end of the month, outflows were $28 billion, and by April, these funds were actually seeing inflows. Correlation is not causation, of course, so we can’t be sure it was solely the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility that provided this stabilization, though researchers at the New York Fed have found compelling data that suggest it did have an effect.\n\nAnd indeed, one thing I noticed throughout the 2020 crisis was that every time we launched a new lending facility — and we ended up launching quite a few — the mere announcement of it had a fairly significant effect on calming markets, even before the facility was actually up and running.\n\nWhile the Fed’s actions were largely successful, I would argue that we do not want the public sector to step in to aid MMFs for a third time. Proposals such as introducing swing pricing requirements, eliminating redemption gates and liquidity fees tied to the level of weekly liquid assets at prime and tax-exempt funds, and increases in liquid asset requirements for all funds are proposals well worth considering. When we say the Fed is the lender of last resort, we mean it.\n\nSo, again, thank you so much for having me. Interesting times call for, I’m certain, an interesting discussion, and now I’m happy to take questions.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be here sharing a stage — well, sharing a screen — with so many friends from the chamber and elsewhere. I know this event is a highlight of the year for many of you, and I’m thrilled that there is such a robust turnout this morning — even if we were forced by COVID-19 to come together virtually rather than in person as we had hoped.\n\nOf course, given that so many of you are old friends, I’m sure that many of you know what I’m about to say next. That’s right, the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe’re here today to look ahead to what the year 2022 has in store. But I firmly believe we can’t hope to accurately project into the future unless we know what’s happening on the ground right now.\n\nWith that said, I hope you’ve had a chance to look at the results from the Chamber of Commerce of Greater Philadelphia’s annual member survey. They offer, to my mind, a clear picture of an economy moving in the right direction, particularly compared with where we were a year ago. But to be clear, our survey indicates far from “smooth sailing” for chamber members. The economy is improving, yes, but still freighted with risks and constraints.\n\nSurvey data are, to my mind, an underrated tool in the economics business. At the Fed, we look at everything from big broad numbers like GDP and employment growth to more granular figures like auto sales and even restaurant reservations. And in recent years, we’ve seen the growth of new data sources like mobility data, which give us information on how much people are traveling and to where.\n\nNow, don’t worry — I promise you that mobility information is anonymized. We take data security very, very seriously.\n\nBut with survey data, we can find out how people and businesses’ economic realities are playing out on the ground. And that’s crucial to all of our understanding of how the economy is really working. I know that as a policymaker, I find survey data invaluable.\n\nI invite you to delve deep into the survey results, which make for fascinating reading. But I also wanted to highlight just a few data points that jumped out at me.\n\nFirst is just how much things have improved for chamber members over the course of the past year. The vast majority of survey respondents indicated higher levels of economic activity in 2021 over 2020. A full 56 percent of respondents reported either slightly or significantly higher volumes of new orders, and 72 percent reported slightly or significantly higher sales or revenues in 2021 over the year before.\n\nOur survey respondents are optimistic that these trends will continue. Nearly three-quarters are expecting slightly or significantly higher sales or revenues in 2022 compared with 2021. Nearly 60 percent are either at or have exceeded their prepandemic employment levels.\n\nNow, with increased sales have come increased costs, particularly on the labor side; 92 percent of respondents expect wage and benefit costs to either increase slightly or significantly in the coming year. That probably goes a long way toward explaining why 47 percent of respondents cited wages and 35 percent of respondents cited the availability of labor as their top concerns for their operations going forward.\n\nWhen it comes to labor supply issues, 56 percent of respondents had difficulty hiring in the past three months because of the lack of qualified applicants, while 29 percent said that candidates were not willing to accept the compensation levels they were offering. And in a fascinating demonstration of how the pandemic has changed the way we work, 17 percent of respondents reported that candidates rejected their offers because of the lack of a fully remote option. Keep in mind that these survey results are largely from before Omicron became widespread, which has further hampered efforts to keep employees healthy and on the job.\n\nIn sum, things will keep improving as long as employers have enough workers to staff their businesses. Going forward, employers are going to have to think creatively about how to attract and retain talent. In the end, I believe we will all benefit from that.\n\nSo, thank you again for joining us this morning. And now, let me turn things back to Andrea.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be here. Almost exactly a year ago, I addressed this same group and expressed my hope that the next time we would be together it would be in person. Obviously I’m disappointed that didn’t pan out, though I definitely think moving this event to virtual was the right and responsible thing to do as we endure another surge of COVID-19. On the other hand, last year I also lamented the performance of the Eagles — whereas this year, I’m sincerely looking forward to the Birds beating the Bucs this weekend. Win some, lose some, in other words.\n\nSomething else I said last year was the standard Fed disclaimer, and that holds true this year as well. The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLooking Back\n\nThe title of this event is Economic Forecast, and I intend to talk a little bit about where the national and local economies are headed and the path of Federal Reserve policy over the next year. Then, we can move on to our Q&A.\n\nI’m also a firm believer that you can’t look ahead without looking back and taking stock of what brought you here. And I’ve found reviewing my remarks to this group from last year to be a useful exercise.\n\nBegin with the positive: During last year’s speech, I noted that about 5 million Americans had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 — less than 2 percent of our total population. Today, that number stands at about 61 percent. Our region is more heavily vaccinated than the national average: Nearly three-quarters of those in Philadelphia are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nWidespread immunity has been a boon to public health, and it has also buoyed our economy. While last year I noted persistent unemployment, this year employers are dealing with a very different problem. There are labor shortages in many industries. That was, to be frank, unexpected — as was last year’s inflation surge, which I will discuss in a bit.\n\nSo too was the persistence of the pandemic even after mass vaccinations. The euphoria many of us experienced last spring when the vaccine campaign began in earnest has given way to some sense of disappointment as new variants of COVID-19 have emerged and as many millions of Americans have refused to be vaccinated. Particularly troubling is the Omicron variant, which, to some degree, evades the protection afforded by vaccination — though vaccines do continue to largely prevent serious illness.\n\nLooking Ahead: The National Economy\n\nSo, where are we headed? Let me begin by noting that, since early 2020, the U.S. economy has largely tracked the path of COVID-19. In spring 2020, we experienced our sharpest contraction on record as policymakers put the U.S. economy into a medically induced coma, shuttering businesses and schools. Since then, we’ve recovered in fits and starts.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, I was often asked what “shape” the recovery would take. Would it be a “V?” An “L?” A “U”? More often than not, I liked to say it would look a little bit like a “Nike swoosh” — a sharp decline followed by a gradual upward climb. Today, I’d amend that to say it looks like a Nike swoosh drawn by somebody who has had one too many cups of coffee — i.e., me on many workdays. We’re climbing undeniably upward, but it’s been a jagged path, largely a result of the virus’s wiles. You can see hits to growth that coincided with last year’s winter surge, the emergence of the Delta variant last summer, and now Omicron.\n\nWhat’s notable about Omicron is that, by and large, aside from a handful of jurisdictions implementing mask mandates, governments are not imposing public health measures that depress business activity. Instead, we are seeing a diminution in certain categories of consumer spending like restaurant dining, led by consumers seeking to avoid the virus. That’s been true throughout the pandemic, of course; many Americans will not engage in normal economic activities if they don’t feel safe.\n\nBut by virtue of Omicron’s extraordinary transmissibility, we are also experiencing something novel during the course of what has already been a novel pandemic: So many people are becoming infected simultaneously that businesses can’t staff themselves. Airlines are canceling flights, restaurants are shuttering their kitchens, and big box retail locations are closing down temporarily. Simply put, too many of their workers are sick with COVID-19.\n\nAll in all, we’re estimating that last year’s GDP growth came in a little above 5 percent. I expect growth to be a little slower this year, perhaps in the range of 3 to 4 percent.\n\nThe first quarter will be tough, with Omicron continuing to spread throughout the country, shuttering businesses, keeping office workers at home and away from already struggling downtowns, and persuading wary consumers to stay home. Later in the year, even after Omicron has — hopefully — faded, financial conditions should tighten and pandemic stimulus programs will wane, somewhat depressing growth. So I don’t expect the kind of gangbusters growth we had in parts of 2020 and 2021 when the economy emerged from pandemic-induced lockdowns.\n\nLooking Ahead: Federal Reserve Policy\n\nWhen I say financial conditions will “tighten,” I am of course referring to how the Fed will react to economic conditions this year. After nearly two years of accommodation, I think we can expect a fair amount of tightening in 2022.\n\nLet’s begin by taking a step back and thinking about the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. We are charged by Congress, for one, to maintain stable prices. In practice, that translates to 2 percent inflation. Last year, we exceeded that number significantly. In December, annualized inflation came in at 7 percent, the highest reading in nearly 40 years. Yes, some of this inflation spurt had to do with conditions unique to our pandemic economy — consumer demand was strong, for instance, owing to fiscal relief, but supplies were constrained because of the virus.\n\nBut it’s clear that inflation is more persistent and higher than any of us want to see. Inflation is effectively a penalty on those with limited means. I’m also concerned that inflation expectations could become unanchored.\n\nThe second plank of our mandate is to ensure maximum employment. Now, at face value, it may seem that the Fed has so far failed to meet that mandate during this pandemic period. After all, we still have around 3 million fewer people employed than we did in February 2020.\n\nBut this is not a standard economic downturn; there is plenty of demand in this economy, especially for labor. What the economy is facing is a major supply shortage. It is simply not true — with apologies to reporters in the audience — that the economy created only 199,000 jobs in December, which is how the media reported it. The economy has created many, many millions of jobs over the past year. They just haven’t been filled. Look at the unemployment rate, which measures those who are working or who are seeking work. It’s at 3.9 percent right now, and we expect it to fall even further this year. There is no lack of labor demand.\n\nThere are many reasons that could explain the depressed labor supply, and I suspect it’s a combination of them that is responsible. Many Americans continue to fear going to work when COVID-19 is widespread; others are having trouble finding someone to take care of their kids at a reasonable price. Millions of others have likely opted to retire, especially with their 401(k)s in such good health. And don’t discount the general reevaluation of life choices that the pandemic has spurred among many of us. Even housing policy is a culprit here. High-cost areas like San Francisco, New York, and Boston will have a hard time attracting new labor supply — and keeping the workers they already have — when housing is so ruinously expensive.\n\nWhat do all of these explanations have in common? They have nothing to do with monetary policy.\n\nThe inescapable logical conclusion of this situation — inflation higher than we want and a very robust jobs market — is to tighten monetary policy. I expect us to complete our taper of asset purchases by March. Then, we can probably expect a rate hike of 25 basis points. We could very well continue to raise rates throughout the year as the data evolve.\n\nIn other words, this is a very different situation than the one we were in when I joined you last year.\n\nLooking Ahead: The Regional Economy\n\nNow, before we move on to our Q&A, I’d like to talk just a bit about how the local economy is progressing.\n\nAll in all, the Philadelphia area’s economy is continuing to make progress toward recovery, particularly in employment. There have been steady gains in payroll employment, unemployment claims have reached new lows, and the unemployment rate has continued to drop. Full recovery, however, is incomplete and vulnerable to ongoing challenges.\n\nThe immediate, as I’ve mentioned, is Omicron. Our contacts report the same issues we are seeing nationwide: increasing troubles keeping their doors open as scores of their workers fall sick. It’s been remarkable in our survey work to see how quickly this new variant has spread. In early December 2021, our contacts reported virtually no trouble keeping staff on the job. By the end of the month, the new variant was everywhere, and these reports were widespread across all sectors.\n\nTo put this in context, during the week ending January 2, more than 41 percent of Philadelphia MSA businesses surveyed by the census bureau reported a “moderate negative” pandemic effect on business and more than a quarter reported “large negative” effects. Only about 22 percent reported “little or no effect.” That’s apparent in other data; restaurant reservations and visits to retail stores are still well below where they were prior to the pandemic.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, leisure and hospitality remains the sector most affected by the pandemic, with employment down by more than 40,000 in our region. Manufacturing, by contrast, remains relatively robust, with employment largely recovered, recent Omicron challenges notwithstanding. Our region’s manufacturers continue to report troubles accessing supplies, however.\n\nOne thing we aren’t lacking is office space, particularly as the pandemic keeps many white-collar workers toiling away at home. Office vacancy rates in Center City are north of 17 percent. Moreover, many tenants are shrinking their office footprints in anticipation of more hybrid work in the years to come.\n\nIn Philadelphia, we can expect modest declines in office rents this year, and for lower-quality office space to be converted to other uses, such as multifamily housing. And the continuing dearth of office workers is having knock-on effects to the economy. SEPTA ridership is down by nearly half from before the pandemic. Our central business district has recovered only about 46 percent of the jobs that were lost at the outset of the pandemic.\n\nHousing prices, by contrast, are strong. In the fall, home price growth in Philadelphia County was around 8 percent. Nearby counties in Greater Philadelphia had home price growth ranging between 12 percent and 20 percent.\n\nAnd, by the way, in case there are any former nurses in the audience, you might want to consider dusting off your RN certification. The most in-demand jobs in our region are for nurses.\n\nLooking Ahead: Football\n\nIf there is one thing that this pandemic has taught us, it is the certainty of uncertainty. As always, the Fed — and I’m sure, all of you — will adapt to conditions as they continue to shift under our feet.\n\nSo, thank you again for having me, and I’m looking forward to our Q&A. I’m also looking forward to doing this again next year — in person — and celebrating the Eagles’ remarkable 2022 playoff run.",

            "content": "Hello! On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and our partner organizations, I’d like to add my welcome to our Fifth Annual Fintech Conference. It’s great to be here today among such a great group of speakers and panelists as we discuss the latest developments in financial technologies, their impacts, and the appropriate policy response. I’m particularly delighted to delve into how fintech can promote financial inclusion. I know these conversations are of much interest to you whether you happen to be an academic, industry practitioner, regulator, economist — or, well, a Federal Reserve Bank president.\n\nWith that in mind, there is a bit of Federal Reserve policy I need to dispense with before I can continue. That is the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHistorical Echoes\n\nWhile we are discussing cutting-edge technologies this week, in a way, many new fintech tools are in essence digitized versions of practices that existed in the past. Before the advent of the modern credit score, for instance, lenders took the kind of expansive look at borrowers that open banking today makes significantly more technologically efficient.\n\nAnd versions of “buy now pay later” have been in widespread use across Latin America since long before we all became tethered to our cell phones. Or, thought about another way, buy now pay later is actually an updated version of Kmart’s old layaway system — with the main difference being you get the product at the beginning of the process rather than at the end.\n\nAnd yes, I realize I’m dating myself by referring to Kmart.\n\nBut the point is that one of the reasons to be bullish about the widespread adoption of these technologies is that they have been used successfully in other, more analog, forms in the past. Fintech makes them more efficient and easier to disseminate.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities\n\nThere are great opportunities here. New methods of assessing credit through open banking offer the possibility of promoting financial inclusion by, for example, expanding the scope of which data lenders consider and how they are used in predicting risk. Why shouldn’t a history of on-time rent or utility payments serve to make someone creditworthy? While there are a few exceptions, these are not elements included in most credit scores used by most lenders today. Many consumers trying to get their first loan find themselves in the paradoxical situation of needing to have established credit already in order to obtain new credit.\n\nBut, of course, the level of access that open banking provides also comes with significant risks. Would a lender penalize would-be borrowers when he sees they spend money at a dollar store rather than at a fancy department store? (Or perhaps vice versa.) All sorts of implicitly biased cultural judgments could come into play here, which would have the perverse effect of perpetuating, rather than mitigating, long-standing patterns of unequal treatment.\n\nThere is significant historical precedence for this. In the pre-credit score era I alluded to earlier, lenders had a much wider latitude when considering a person’s creditworthiness. But that meant all sorts of personal biases could — and often did — play a huge role in allocating credit, with particularly unfair outcomes for minority communities.\n\nFintech in and of itself is value neutral, in other words. It is a tool. And it is a tool that can be used to promote financial inclusion, or a tool that can be used to perpetuate long-standing biases. And that is because, fundamentally, humans are responsible for the way financial technologies operate.\n\nConsider the question of fintech’s role in allocating credit.\n\nFintech and Loans\n\nFintech platforms are increasingly playing a role in issuing loans — both new stand-alone platforms and established lenders are using artificial intelligence to make these decisions. But rather than remove human judgment from the process, these technologies have instead shifted where in the process human judgment comes in. It used to be at the end: A lender would collect the information she deemed necessary and then render a decision. Today, it comes at the beginning of the process when algorithms are being designed and trained.\n\nThink of all the human judgments that need to be made when training an algorithm.\n\nFirst, people must be aware of how the data being used to train the algorithm were collected and cleaned. And what were their original purposes, given that most of these data were collected for purposes other than how they are being used in this particular algorithm? That answer, after all, has implications for the data themselves — especially given inherent selection biases of commission or omission.\n\nThen there is the question of which determinations will be made by the algorithm. Is it offering a simple Yes or No on issuing a loan? Or is it also deciding on the size of the credit line, including for an account that already exists? Or is it determining the rate offered? Will it decide who to market loans to? Or what messages to stress when doing that marketing? Does it decide the strategy for managing an existing account that exhibits increasing risk or a departure from the consumer’s normal pattern of using the account? Does it determine who is eligible for a work-out program and on what terms? Is it used to determine collection strategies for accounts in default? What information is communicated to the consumer about the whys of a decision made by models that many of us view as a black box?\n\nThe humans in attendance today, in other words, can rest easy: We are not obsolete yet.\n\nConclusion\n\nWill fintech platforms promote financial inclusion? They certainly can — and, in my view, absolutely should. But whether they do this is up to all of us — industry, academia, our elected leaders, and regulators.\n\nThat’s why this week’s series of conversations is so crucial. So thank you again for joining us.\n\nAnd now, it is my distinct honor to welcome our next guests, Anthony Eisen and Larry Summers.\n\nAnthony Eisen is cofounder and CEO of Afterpay. He has more than 25 years of experience in investing, public company directorships, and providing corporate advice across a variety of sectors. Prior to cofounding Afterpay, Anthony was the chief investment officer at the Guinness Peat Group, where he was actively involved in a number of financial services, software, and technology companies.\n\nWe’re also thrilled to have Larry Summers with us today. Larry is the Charles W. Eliot University Professor and President Emeritus at Harvard University. In addition to serving as 71st Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration, he was director of the White House National Economic Council in the Obama administration, president of Harvard University, and the chief economist of the World Bank.\n\nSo, thank you again. And now let’s continue with the conference.",

            "content": "Hello! It’s an honor to be here today to talk a little bit about our country’s economic outlook, Federal Reserve policy, and some recent research on housing that I think will be of particular interest to this group. I’ve long wanted to have a conversation with all of you at the Economic Club of New York, though I must admit that when I used to envision it, I thought we’d be doing it in 3D. Soon enough, I hope.\n\nI’m really looking forward to our dialogue — especially the fireside chat and Q&A after my prepared remarks — but before I begin, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe State of the Recovery\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, I was often asked what “shape” the recovery would take. Would it be a “V?” An “L?” A “U”? More often than not, I liked to say it would look a little bit like a “Nike swoosh” — a sharp decline followed by a gradual upward climb.\n\nIf I could amend that prediction today, I would put it this way: Our recovery looks like a Nike swoosh drawn by somebody who has had one too many cups of coffee — i.e., me on many workdays. We’re climbing undeniably upward, but it’s a jagged path. And our turbulent recovery has been shaped largely, as so much has, by the path of COVID-19.\n\nConsider this: The second quarter of 2020 saw our economy’s sharpest contraction on record as COVID-19 reached our shores. This, of course, was largely intentional as states shuttered businesses and schools and ordered citizens to stay home in a bid to contain the virus. We put our economy, effectively, into a medical coma.\n\nThe economy jolted quickly awake that summer as states reopened and a large dose of fiscal relief was injected into American households and businesses. But then last winter’s tragic COVID-19 surge ensured the economy went sideways. This was followed by another growth spurt earlier this year as vaccines were introduced and COVID-19 rates plummeted. And then the Delta variant showed up and, once again, growth slowed markedly.\n\nSo in 2021, GDP growth in the first half of the year was around 6½ percent, while the second half will be significantly slower. I expect the full year to come in around 5½ percent. Next year, if another major COVID-19 wave can be avoided — and I think it can, given widespread vaccinations and natural immunity among those who’ve recovered from the virus — we should see another growth spurt to more than 4 percent before the economy returns to something approaching trend growth of 2 percent to 3 percent in 2023.\n\nThe economy is continuing to recover, in other words. But it is doing so under constraints.\n\nConstraints\n\nThe first constraint is a lack of people — labor. Despite very robust jobs gains in October, the U.S. economy has still created many millions of jobs in recent months that haven’t been filled.\n\nJob openings, sitting around 10 million, are at near-record highs, running at double their long-term average. So is the rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs.\n\nLayoff rates, meanwhile, are at series lows. And those people who are working are putting in longer hours and commanding higher wages; average hourly earnings are up more than 4½ percent from 2020.\n\nIt seems that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about the virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general revaluation of life choices — is persuading many Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the economy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce. I do expect that will change eventually and especially as other forbearance programs run out. There is also a spatial-geographic component to unfilled jobs, which I will discuss further when we get to housing issues.\n\nThe other constraint hampering economic growth is a lack of stuff. Supply chains are badly hobbled, leading to shortages of everything from new vehicles to home appliances to chicken wings.\n\nManufacturers curtailed production as the pandemic set in and are now working furiously to ramp up — but it’s taking time. And this is occurring as demand is very strong because household balance sheets are in such good shape.\n\nThe result of this equation — a lack of goods coupled with high demand — is, of course, inflation. And indeed, inflation readings are now at 30-year highs; core inflation was up more than 3½ percent from a year ago in September, and headline inflation was up nearly 5½ percent.\n\nMoreover, inflation is more widespread across products and services than it was earlier this year. In the third quarter, nearly three-quarters of spending on goods and services in the CPI “basket” was on goods that displayed annualized inflation of more than 4 percent; in the second quarter, that was true for only a little more than a third of the goods and services that comprise the basket.\n\nI am acutely aware that this period of rising prices is painful for many Americans. But I do expect inflation to moderate next year as supply chains come back online and bottlenecks ease.\n\nWith economic growth chugging along and job creation — if not job filling — so robust, the FOMC announced last week that we will begin tapering our purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bills by $15 billion a month. I don’t expect that the federal funds rate will rise before the tapering is complete, but we are monitoring inflation very closely and are prepared to take action, should circumstances warrant it.\n\nRenters\n\nOne thing I’ve noticed in my travels is that when you’re in Los Angeles, you always end up talking about the traffic — how it was bumper to bumper on the 405 or the 101. When you’re in Philadelphia, meanwhile, you always end up talking about the Eagles — although, let’s please not do that today … it’s too painful.\n\nAnd I’ve also found that whenever you’re in New York, you end up discussing housing, and specifically housing costs. Which is why I’m delighted to share some recent research from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve about this most important topic. One of the pleasures of my job as a Reserve Bank president is talking about all of the pathbreaking research we do besides that which is directly related to monetary policy.\n\nI’d like to begin with renters, who often get short shrift in our national political conversation, despite making up more than 35 percent of all Americans — and disproportionately higher numbers in big cities like Philadelphia and New York.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, Congress passed a moratorium on evictions. This, in a way, functioned like mortgage forbearance; with evictions no longer a risk, many Americans who were struggling stopped paying their rent either partially or in full. And while the eviction moratorium did, thankfully, prevent people from losing their homes, those rent payments didn’t go away — they became debt owed by the tenants.\n\nResearchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been tracking rental debt to understand which households are burdened and how significantly. This is especially urgent now that the eviction moratorium has expired.\n\nThis month, our economists project, roughly 1.9 million households carry COVID-19‒related rental debt, or about 6 percent of all renter households. And they carry an average debt of nearly $9,000 — a severe burden for unemployed or underemployed households.\n\nCongress has made aid available to many renters who are struggling, but there have been persistent problems throughout the pandemic in getting that vital support into the hands of those who need it the most.\n\nAs part of our understanding of how the pandemic is affecting people on the ground, the Philadelphia Fed has been conducting a series called the CFI COVID-19 Survey of Consumers. And those surveys have consistently found that many renters are, unfortunately, simply unaware of the aid that they qualify for or how to go about obtaining it. As of last month, roughly 43 percent of renters who say they require assistance had not applied for it. Clearly, this is a problem: No matter how well intentioned or well designed a program is, it can hardly be judged a triumph if nearly half the people who would benefit from it are not partaking in it.\n\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, I would also urge policymakers to not only make sure indebted households have access to the funds intended for them, but also to think creatively about ways to reduce rents, including reforming zoning regulations to induce more residential construction.\n\nThere is evidence, in fact, that high rents may be affecting the labor market and hindering efforts to get us back to full employment. That’s because many workers can’t afford to live where jobs are. It’s tough to ask somebody to work in a restaurant in San Francisco, for instance, when the nearest place with affordable housing may be in, say, Fresno. This not only hinders attempts to fill jobs, but, ultimately, it degrades the economic performance of areas with expensive housing. Expensive metro areas are not achieving their full economic potential because millions of would-be participants simply can’t afford to be there.\n\nHomeowners\n\nNow, I’d like to turn to homeowners. As I’m sure this audience is aware, the CARES Act provided for mortgage forbearance, allowing borrowers to stop paying on their houses for up to a year and a half.\n\nEarlier this year, my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed set out to answer two central questions about this program. First: What is the extent of racial and income disparities among mortgage borrowers in nonpayment on their mortgages, and how has the pandemic affected these disparities? Then, they wanted to find out who took up forbearance on their mortgages and who missed this important opportunity.\n\nBecause the CARES Act mandates that borrowers in forbearance who aren’t paying on their mortgages still be reported to credit bureaus as if they are paying, these turned out to be surprisingly tricky questions to answer. But through some quite clever methods — my Philadelphia Fed colleagues are nothing if not ingenious — the researchers were able to suss out the data.\n\nHere is what they found: Between April and November 2020, an acute phase of the COVID-19 crisis, minorities’ and lower-income borrowers’ nonpayment rates were twice as high as for higher-income and White borrowers.\n\nEven if we compare borrowers with the same credit score and the same loan type, Black and Hispanic borrowers have more than 30 percent higher rates of nonpayment, and lower-income borrowers, 50 percent higher. Moreover, and importantly, these disparities largely did not exist pre-COVID-19.\n\nIn a sign that the CARES Act was effective, my colleagues found that minority and lower-income borrowers took up forbearances at significantly higher rates than other groups.\n\nThe rub, of course, is that under the CARES Act and subsequent extension from the Biden administration, forbearance lasts only up to 18 months, meaning many borrowers will be coming off of it by the end of the year, which is also when temporary protections against foreclosure are set to expire.\n\nThat’s concerning, given that as of mid-October, about 15 percent of people who went into forbearance in the first place are still in it — an estimated 1.1 million borrowers. And as with rental debt, those missed payments just didn’t go away. They are now additional debt burdening households who went into forbearance.\n\nThe good news is that most of the 8 million or so households that took forbearance during the crisis have fully recovered. Due in part to the booming housing market, which has seen a 20 percent gain in house prices nationally since the onset of the pandemic, more than two-thirds of households came out of forbearance and are either current on their mortgages or have paid off or refinanced them. Borrowers still unable to resume full payments are being offered payment reductions to the tune of 20 to 25 percent. While it is still early, some borrowers in need of assistance have started to take advantage of these home-retention programs.\n\nStill, about 20 percent of borrowers are either still in forbearance or are now delinquent. Banks, meanwhile, report being unable to contact many borrowers who have stopped paying to work out new terms.\n\nThat presents a challenge to borrowers first and foremost, of course, but also to lenders given the expense and hassle involved in foreclosure.\n\nKeeping people in their homes isn’t only vital because of the first order issue of shelter — it’s also crucial to wealth building. A person’s house may be their castle. But in many cases, it is also their savings account. This is, in part, because homeowners can borrow against their home’s value to boost their lifetime earnings and capital gains. Here, there is a silver lining to the current economic environment; whereas during the Great Recession, nearly half of distressed borrowers were “underwater,” meaning their mortgage was larger than their home’s actual value; today, only around 2 percent are.\n\nThe nation’s racial wealth gap owes much to both unequal rates of homeownership among groups and among disparate housing values — often a legacy of direct government policy. Using a series of geospatial maps, Philadelphia Fed researchers have found that properties with covenants within the city of Philadelphia from 1920 to 1932 formed an invisible barrier to less densely populated areas sought after by White residents and around predominantly White neighborhoods throughout the city — and that those effects are still visible a century later. This too is an issue that will require deliberate policy action to redress.\n\nUltimately, we must all work to make sure that all Americans can build wealth and participate fully in the U.S. economy — and housing policy is a big part of that.\n\nI’m eager to discuss this and much else besides during our fireside chat. And for more information on this and other research, please do check out our recently redesigned website: philadelphiafed.org.\n\nThank you again so much for having me.

            "content": "Good evening! Thanks so much for having me. I understand that when this group meets in person there is usually pizza involved — so I intend to collect on that debt next time we do this in the flesh.\n\nI plan to offer a few remarks about the state of the national economy and the path of Federal Reserve policy. Then we can move to our Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to.\n\nBut before I do that, I need to give you the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFed Structure\n\nI know this group encompasses a very diverse crowd — we have everyone from House staffers to Senate staffers here. So, just in case anyone doesn’t know, I want to begin by giving you a very brief explanation of what, exactly, a regional Federal Reserve Bank is. Our nation’s central bank, after all, is quite unusual — unique, even — in its design.\n\nThe configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized structure — owes its existence to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. It is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise and reflects the unique demands of the United States and our economy.\n\nThe System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, and 12 regional Banks around the country.\n\nThe Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and board of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area. Fundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective — within each District — of the sectors and issues that make the region tick. Mine is the Third District, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and the state of Delaware. We’re the smallest District geographically, but I like to think we punch above our weight.\n\nThe FOMC, which is responsible for monetary policy, is composed of the Fed’s governors and regional Bank presidents. Regional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three years, but the governors always vote, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, owing to the presence of Wall Street, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the System.\n\nWhile the rest of us don’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion. If you were at a normal FOMC meeting, you probably wouldn’t be able to tell a voting member until the end of the meeting when it’s time to raise hands. Everybody contributes.\n\nThe Fed’s decentralized nature is, in my view, a unique strength. We’re making national policy, but we’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the ground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia, Dover, or Washington than they do in Dallas, Salt Lake City, or Honolulu. This System gives a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\n\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such a massive country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger populations, and no one country has a bigger economy, at least for now. And that economy is vast, spreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that is not typical of other nations.\n\nSo, it makes sense that we have a System that feeds back information from around the country.\n\nThe State of the Economy\n\nAnd what that information is telling us is that, for the past 18 months, the economy has moved in tandem with the waxing and waning of the COVID-19 pandemic. During periods when case rates and hospitalizations have declined, the economy has surged as American consumers have voted with their wallets. When COVID-19 risks abate, more Americans dine out at restaurants, check in to hotels, and fill up airplanes. Those are important categories of spending in a country where consumption makes up about 70 percent of total economic activity. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, GDP grew at a very healthy annualized rate of around 6.7 percent as case rates plummeted.\n\nAnd, of course, the opposite occurs during periods when the virus spikes. When the Delta variant of COVID-19 erupted, fomenting the country’s fourth major wave of the pandemic, things started moving sideways. Consumer confidence tanked, and large industries like hospitality and leisure stagnated at best. So for this quarter, we can expect growth to come in at an annualized rate of around 3 percent, a sharp slowdown from earlier this year.\n\nBut there are reasons to be sanguine that the country’s recovery from this wave of COVID-19 may prove more durable than in the past and that we can avoid a fifth wave. And that is because more than half of the country is fully vaccinated. Getting more shots into arms will save lives and aid the recovery by reducing the size and severity of future spikes. The Delta variant has also concentrated minds: It seems to have not only persuaded more Americans to get shots on their own, but it also pushed more corporations and institutions to mandate their employees to get vaccinated. That is cause for optimism.\n\nFilling me with less optimism is the persistent constraints the economy is operating under.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has revealed how fragile many of our supply chains are. We’re now experiencing shortages of crucial parts like computer chips, which has hobbled not only the production of cars and trucks, but also comparatively smaller durable goods like home appliances. My recent experience attempting to purchase a printer — there were essentially none at my local electronics store — testifies to that. And good luck trying to find a new washing machine or dishwasher.\n\nThese supply chain constraints are rippling through the entire economy. Manufacturers in our region have reported having to curtail production because of difficulties securing raw materials. We’re also seeing low inventory of everything from shoes to backpacks to even chicken wings, which is a particularly troubling development as the NFL season is picking up. Unfortunately, there are indications that these constraints could persist for a couple of more years.\n\nThere’s another input lacking in supply as well, further constraining the economy: labor. It isn’t true, as was widely reported, that the economy only created 194,000 jobs in September. In reality, the U.S. economy has created many millions of jobs in recent months — we just can’t fill them. Indeed, job openings are at record highs, hitting nearly 10.5 million at the end of August. Simultaneously, more people are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open positions are being filled is continuing to slow.\n\nIt seems that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about the virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general revaluation of life choices — is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the economy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce. I do expect that will change eventually and especially as other forbearance programs run out.\n\nSo, where does all of this leave us? For 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in around 5.5 percent, which is a downward revision from before Delta took hold. Growth will then moderate to about 3.5 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation, meanwhile, should come in around 4 percent for 2021, though I do see upside risk here. After that, our modal forecast — that is, the average of all of our forecasts — calls for inflation of a bit over 2 percent for 2022 and right at 2 percent in 2023.\n\nFed Policy\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, I am in the camp that believes it will soon be time to begin slowly and methodically — frankly, boringly — taper our $120 billion in monthly purchases of Treasury bills and mortgage-backed securities. This comes down to the efficacy of these purchases as a tool.\n\nThey were necessary to keep markets functioning during the acute phase of the crisis. But to the extent that we are still dealing with a labor force issue, the problem lies on the supply side, not with demand. You can’t go into a restaurant or drive down a commercial strip without noticing a sea of “Help Wanted” signs. Asset purchases aren’t doing much — or anything — to ameliorate that.\n\nAfter we taper our asset purchases, we can begin to think about raising the federal funds rate. But I wouldn’t expect any hikes to interest rates until late next year or early 2023, unless the inflation picture changes dramatically.\n\nConclusion\n\nGiven the strong headwinds facing the economy, it is a testament to its underlying strength that growth continues at a relatively robust pace. That is a tribute, as always, to the ingenuity and tenacity of our people, especially in the face of huge challenges.\n\nThank you very much again for having me. And now let’s move on to questions.",

(Yes, there are computer chips in your washing machine; we’ve come a long way since the days of the washboard.) One of our business contacts, a major homebuilder, tells us he’s now selling new homes with used appliances in them with the promise that he’ll replace them as soon as he can. Manufacturers in our region are also reporting being hamstrung by supply chain issues. Unfortunately, there are indications that these constraints could persist for the next couple of years.\n\nThere’s another input lacking in supply as well: labor. Job openings are at record highs, hitting nearly 11 million at the end of July. Meanwhile, more people are quitting their jobs, and the rate at which open positions are being filled is continuing to slow. The upshot, of course, is better pay for those who are working: Wages are up more than 4 percent year over year.\n\nIt’s clear that a combination of factors — trouble accessing childcare or eldercare, lingering fears about the virus, the rise in equities and home values spurring people to retire, and perhaps a general revaluation of life choices — is persuading a lot of Americans to stay on the sidelines even as the economy has reopened. And notably, the elimination of extra federal unemployment benefits has not noticeably — at least not yet — appeared to nudge people back into the workforce.\n\nHere in Delaware, there are strong signs of economic recovery. Nearly 70 percent of adults are fully vaccinated, and various economic metrics are trending in a positive direction.\n\nOn the jobs front, the unemployment rate in Delaware was 5.4 percent in August, representing a huge improvement from April 2020 when the jobless rate was 13.4 percent. But there is still some ground to be made up: In February 2020, unemployment stood at 4.5 percent. Employment in financial services and manufacturing is either at or very close to prepandemic numbers, though there is still ground to be made up in leisure and hospitality. In terms of unfilled job openings, the most in-demand roles in the state are registered nurses, applications software developers, and customer service representatives.\n\nThe housing market continues to perform well. The state’s year-over-year home price growth in July was around 16.2. Home price growth in Sussex County has been even stronger at around 20 percent. Exports have rebounded significantly, too, with healthy growth in the outbound shipment of chemicals, computers and electronics, and transportation equipment.\n\nOn the national level, for 2021, I would expect GDP growth to come in at around 6.5 percent. It will then moderate to about 3.5 percent in 2022, and 2.5 percent in 2023. Inflation, meanwhile, should come in around 4 percent for 2021 — we’re already seeing some moderation there, as prices of used cars finally stabilize.

            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome! It’s great to see so many of you at this, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s 11th biennial conference on household finance and consumer payments — though this is the first we’ve held in 2D.\n\nWhile I’ll regret the lack of hallway conversation — honestly, some of my best ideas have come about quite randomly at the edges of conferences like this — it’s great that by holding this conference virtually we are able to host such a widely dispersed set of participants and attendees. Though I suspect some of you are regretting missing the opportunity to pad your frequent flyer account balances … which is something else I can personally attest to.\n\nAs the president and CEO of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, it always gives me great pride to tout the stellar work of our Consumer Finance Institute. But before I do that, also as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, there is something else I must do. That is providing the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe launched the Consumer Finance Institute — CFI to us at the Philadelphia Fed — in 2017 as a strategic initiative dedicated to producing leading-edge, policy-relevant research, and events like this one. CFI explores how credit markets and payment systems affect consumers and the economy. But while the institute itself is only 4 years old, it is built on a foundation of two decades of heavy investment in research centered on how people earn, spend, save, and invest. The Philadelphia Fed’s interest in these topics is not only academic: Our goal at CFI is to develop insights that contribute to a healthy consumer sector, a stable financial system, and a resilient regional and national economy.\n\nFor us, this is personal. Philadelphia is the poorest big city in the United States.\n\nConferences like this one are a big part of CFI’s strategy to promote a healthier economy — and you’ll soon see why. In the next two days, we’ll be learning about path-breaking research focused on timely subjects such as building wealth through homeownership, consumer bankruptcy, pandemic housing relief, and consumer protection and regulation. These are rich and interesting subjects for rigorous research in their own right, but they are also vitally important topics that have an impact on all Americans, just about every day.\n\nWhen I was reviewing the conference materials, I was also struck by how much of the research presented at this conference will focus on the racial inequities that continue to bedevil our society. The research presented will focus, for instance, on racial disparities in bankruptcy filings and housing values, important examples of the many drivers of our nation’s yawning racial wealth gap.\n\nAnd this, too, is personal for us. Philadelphia is not only America’s poorest big city, it is also the nation’s largest predominantly Black one.\n\nIn recent years, CFI researchers have documented new facts about differences in outcomes by race as it pertains to consumers’ finances, with the ultimate goal of identifying why those disparities exist. Without both — the facts and an understanding of the causal drivers — there is no way to have meaningful discussions about how public policies can improve outcomes.\n\nIn my view, such research and debate is the right thing to do, morally — and also holds great economic importance. As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is charged with building an economy that makes opportunity available to everyone and that achieves maximum employment. We can’t do that so long as profound racial inequities persist for reasons we do not fully understand.\n\nSo just in the past year, CFI has published important new research findings, for instance, that Black, Hispanic, and Asian mortgage borrowers were significantly more likely than White borrowers to miss payments due to financial distress — and significantly less likely to refinance to take advantage of the large decline in interest rates that was spurred by the Federal Reserve’s mortgage-backed security purchase program. We’ve also examined which groups took up mortgage forbearance at which rates, and what effect that had on racial disparities. The news there is somewhat more encouraging. And we’ve conducted an ongoing series of surveys focused on how the pandemic has affected different groups of Americans.\n\nCFI scholars have also taken a historical view, examining, for example, the ongoing effects of racial covenants included in housing deeds nearly a century ago. Using a series of geospatial maps, we found that properties with covenants within the city of Philadelphia formed an invisible barrier to less densely populated areas sought after by White residents and around predominantly White neighborhoods throughout the city — and that those effects are still visible.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the work CFI researchers are doing every day, and I urge all of you — once the conference is over — to please dig into our website at philadelphiafed.org, for much, much more.\n\nNow, I’m well aware you’ve joined us to hear from our conference presenters rather than me, so I’ll leave you. But before I go, I can’t resist one more boast about the fantastic work we’re doing at the Consumer Finance Institute. For this conference, we received approximately 140 submissions and selected only eight papers to be presented. Super Bowl tickets are easier to get most years. What a testament to the global recognition that CFI is receiving for its important, path-breaking work!\n\nSo, thank you again for joining us and please enjoy the conference.",

            "content": "Hello and welcome! It’s great that so many of you have joined us for these virtual office hours. And by holding this event virtually, we are missing out on useful hallway conversation — not to mention some tasty snacks — but it’s terrific so many of you were able to join with just the click of a button.\n\nNow, before we proceed, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Importance of Community Banks\n\nHere at the Fed we wear many hats: We’re a bank, a supervisor and regulator of other banks, and the largest collection of economists in the world. We have the ability to lend money, to foster payments and settlements, and to promote consumer protection and community development.\n\nWe also have the power to convene. And that is precisely our aim with this program: to facilitate face-to-face discussions with individual banks and fintech firms about responsible financial innovation. We’re delighted you’re here to learn more about how innovation and technology are impacting the financial landscape.\n\nThese meetings can be two-way learning opportunities for all participants. Banks have tremendous regulatory expertise, and fintech firms have deep wells of innovation expertise. But this will also be a learning experience for us here at the Federal Reserve. Your insights are crucial to what we do here every day — so please don’t hold back.\n\nI’m particularly glad that we have so many representatives from small community banks here. While I probably don’t need to belabor the importance of community banks to this particular audience, I think it sometimes gets lost just how central community banks are to our economy — and indeed, to American society.\n\nJust consider the numbers. There are more than 4,800 active community bank charters across the country. And of those, almost exactly half are in communities with fewer than 50,000 residents. Community banks — those with $10 billion or less in assets — collectively hold more than $3 trillion in assets. You don’t need to rewatch It’s a Wonderful Life for the hundredth time to get a sense of how vitally important these institutions are.\n\nCOVID-19 and its associated economic effects not only emphasized the importance of community banks; they have also heightened the risks to the sector in a world where more and more business is conducted online.\n\nGiven their strong relationships with local businesses, community banks were absolutely essential to operating the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which kept so many small businesses afloat during the pandemic. According to my Fed colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, community banks have made up about 40 percent of the total value of PPP loans issued. It’s probably no exaggeration to say that the PPP would have failed without community banks’ support.\n\nOpportunities and Challenges\n\nBut economic shutdowns imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 — particularly those that shuttered bank branches — also demonstrated just how important digitization is and the perils of falling behind on financial innovation and fintech.\n\nOnline platforms have gobbled up an increasing number of home mortgages, for instance. And one banker in our area here in the Third District recently told me that because of labor shortages in his area, he has been unable to reopen his bank lobbies even as the pandemic has waned. If these trends hold, expect more and more use of digital solutions.\n\nDuring these office hours, I would encourage bankers to consider digitization opportunities for your institution and customers, as well as innovative opportunities that align with your strategic plans. And tomorrow, we will hear from District bankers about their experiences with fintech partnerships and innovation.\n\nThere are many opportunities, not only for serving your existing customers but also for reaching new populations. Think of the creative ways fintech could be deployed to reach the under- or even unbanked, for instance.\n\nI understand, of course, that there are challenges. Smaller banks often simply don’t have the workforce or the cash to first research and investigate and then to ultimately invest in costly fintech platforms. They lack the economies of scale that bigger banks enjoy. Set-up costs can be prohibitive. And, to be frank, there are occasional cultural differences between the “move fast and break things” ethos of many fintech suppliers and the more risk-averse sensibilities of bankers.\n\nAnd those risks are real. Consider the astonishing rapidity of technological development. There are serious and understandable concerns: What if a year or two after making an expensive fintech investment, the technology has already become obsolete? You don’t want to be stuck with a bunch of buggy whips a year after the invention of the Model T.\n\nAnd there can be a hesitancy to embrace new technologies on the client side, too, of course. Paper checks and cash, for instance, have endured in part because people are so comfortable with them.\n\nIt is precisely because of these opportunities and these risks that these office hours are such a great opportunity for all of us. Constructive dialogue among banks, fintech firms, and the Federal Reserve will help us to listen and learn from each other.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is very supportive of innovation. We’re here to convene, to support, and to supervise.\n\nWe will now hear from Bill Spaniel, head of supervision at the Philadelphia Fed, and Board of Governors Deputy Director Art Lindo on community bank partnerships.\n\nThanks again and enjoy the event.",

            "content": "Hello and welcome! It’s wonderful to be here and as nice as it would be to have met in person, it’s pretty great that we were able to do this without any jet lag. Though given how international a crowd we have here today, I suspect some of you regret missing the opportunity to pad your frequent flyer account balances …\n\nThis has been a great series of meetings so far this week, and I’m thrilled to be here with President Bostic to discuss such a vitally important topic: rebuilding our economy sustainably and equitably. I really like the framing of this conversation because you can’t have one without the other. An equitable recovery will be, by its very nature, more likely to be sustainable — and vice versa.\n\nNow, given that you’ve already heard from several Fed presidents this week, I’m pretty sure you know what I am going to say next. Yes, once again, it’s the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Job Deficit\n\nNow, another thing I’m sure you’ve heard from other Fed presidents this week is that the U.S. economy, by and large, is in good shape overall. GDP has come roaring back after a record contraction during the first half of 2020; consumption, housing, and manufacturing are extremely healthy; and workers’ incomes are rising.\n\nBut even as GDP has almost entirely recouped its losses from last year, employment remains down significantly. We still have nearly 7.6 million fewer people working than we did before the pandemic. And if you assume we would have maintained our prepandemic job growth of around 200,000 jobs a month had COVID-19 never arrived, we’re really down around 10.6 million jobs.\n\nMany millions more are in low opportunity jobs — those that pay little, don’t offer flexibility or paths to growth, or don’t take advantage of the skills they possess. Perhaps most disturbing has been a long-term decline in economic mobility, with Americans born in poverty increasingly likely to stay there.\n\nOne of our most important responsibilities as we emerge from the pandemic — as central bankers, policymakers, and simply concerned citizens — is building an equitable workforce recovery and charting a society in which all citizens, no matter how humble the circumstances in which they are born, have a shot at achieving their full economic potential.\n\nSo, what will an equitable workforce recovery look like in practice? I’d like to sketch out a few ideas before we proceed to the discussion with President Bostic.\n\nBuilding an Equitable Workforce Recovery\n\nFor central bankers, first and foremost, an equitable workforce recovery will mean using monetary policy to fulfill our dual mandate of achieving both stable prices and maximum employment. You’ll recall that before the pandemic, when the job market was very robust, we were finally starting to see the kind of wage growth at the bottom half of the income spectrum that we’ve all been hoping for. The racial wage gap, which has bedeviled the United States since, frankly, before its founding, was finally starting to narrow as well. A robust job market, where businesses are competing for labor, will do a lot in and of itself to build an equitable recovery.\n\nBut it won’t do everything.\n\nThat’s why building an equitable workforce recovery will also mean getting more people into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the median wage but that don’t require a four-year college degree. We know that many Americans have the skills and talent to make these transitions because we’ve done the research to prove it.\n\nMy colleagues at the Philadelphia and Cleveland Feds looked at the skill sets of people who hold low-opportunity jobs that are at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. The results were incredibly encouraging: Examining 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay differences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in salary. For instance, bill collectors here in Philadelphia could increase their salary 45 percent, from an average of about $38,000 to nearly $55,000, by becoming a credit counselor — with the added bonus that people will actually want to answer the phone when you call.\n\nWhile the equilibrium effect will undoubtedly smooth out some of these wage differences as the labor force shifts, more people being aware that their skills are transferable will no doubt improve matches between employers and employees and boost employee bargaining power. That is to say, simply informing workers that their skills are transferable — and monetizable — is an important foundation in an equitable workforce recovery. It should also make firms more productive, which benefits all of us in the long run.\n\nBuilding an equitable workforce recovery also will mean that all who want to be in the labor force, can. And that especially includes mothers of young children, whose participation rates fell at the beginning of the pandemic and have yet to recover. It’s no mystery why this has happened: childcare woes. Many parents — and let’s be frank, mothers — left the labor force to take care of their kids as schools closed and other options proved prohibitively expensive. And even as the pandemic has waned here in the U.S., some scarring has become apparent. Around 1.5 million mothers who were working in February 2020 still aren’t. At the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, we’re currently working on what we call a Research in Action Lab in the state of Delaware that will link several local partners, including the state’s chamber of commerce, to help provide affordable childcare for families.\n\nAnd lastly, building an equitable workforce recovery will mean ensuring that workers have access to the training and education they need to advance in the job market. This doesn’t have to be a traditional four-year degree, but we do know that at least some post-high school education is vital for career development in the current economy.\n\nThis could mean the creative use of public‒private partnerships. Here in Philadelphia, we’ve partnered with local stakeholders to advance a one-of-a kind “pay for success” job training model that links Comcast, a major employer here, with Philadelphia Works, our local publicly funded job training board.\n\nThe workforce board pays for training for new hires up front; the employer then reimburses the city if certain benchmarks, such as staying on the job for six months, are met. This is good for both parties: Workers get the skills employers need, and the workforce organizations know they are training for real job opportunities.\n\nOr it could mean increased investment in microcredential courses that teach workers a marketable new skill in a short period of time — as brief as two months. According to a recent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in enrollees’ careers: Certificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in fields like information technology and legal studies.\n\nOf course, even as we look for creative ways to employ short-term programs as an alternative to traditional degrees, we must ensure equal opportunity to all types of degree and non-degree programs. We must not allow for a two-tiered system of higher education to flourish, with low-income and minority students funneled into experimental programs while facing barriers to obtaining traditional degrees.\n\nAnd that’s why building an equitable workforce recovery will also mean employing creative ways to finance traditional four-year college degrees that — despite the sundry and well-known flaws of our higher education system — remain one of the most dependable ladders to middle class. Income share agreements, for instance, where students pay back a portion of their salary after graduation in exchange for borrowing less — or nothing — up front, are a potential path forward.\n\nColleges and universities, too, should think hard about ways to lower their own costs, such as through the thoughtful use of technology to achieve economies of scale. Here, the task is truly urgent: New research from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s Consumer Finance Institute projects that our nation’s colleges and universities will suffer revenue declines of between $70 billion and $115 billion over the next five years, with some 80 percent of institutions nationwide suffering declines. These losses must not simply be passed onto students, the magnitude of whose student debt load is already unique in the developed world.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, an equitable workforce recovery isn’t merely a “nice to have.” Nor is it exclusively a moral issue for our society — though it is, in my view, precisely that. It’s a necessity for building a recovery that will prove durable and sustainable.\n\nWe know this because highly unequal societies tend to be brittle. Their political systems are frequently unstable. Their periods of economic growth are often short lived and unimpressive. Ensuring an equitable recovery will, in the end, benefit us all.\n\nSo again, thank you all for joining us. And now let’s move on to the discussion.",

            "content": "Hello! What an engaging and important event this has been. And I sincerely mean it when I say those are some tough acts — plural — to follow. So thank you all for joining us. I am truly pleased to be here with you today to close things out.\n\nBut first, a bit of housekeeping before I proceed. That’s my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Problem\n\nToday’s event, the book we are releasing, and so much of the work we do every day at the Federal Reserve is motivated by the same central insight: Declining economic mobility is one of the defining challenges of our time. Indeed, not only is it an economic challenge that needs to be solved — it’s also, in my view, a direct challenge to our nation’s highest ideals. One of the animating creeds of our country, after all, is that no person should be held back by the circumstances of their birth.\n\nBut far too many of people’s paths to success have been blocked. Intergenerational mobility has fallen in recent decades. Income inequality has remained stubbornly high.\n\nThat can breed frustration; at times even complacency. It’s natural for people to feel hopeless in the face of monumental problems; they can feel insurmountable.\n\nInnovative Solutions\n\nAnd that’s why today’s program has been so inspiring. What this program’s presentations and the stories we have read about in the book demonstrate so vividly is that these problems can be solved. While the case studies we highlight here are special, they are not aberrations. The ideas and tools they’ve developed are practical — and in many cases, replicable. I’m an engineer by trade and a pragmatist by education and disposition. So what I think is really great about these programs is that they are focused on what works.\n\nPart of recognizing what works is being clear-eyed about what doesn’t. The “train and pray” model, where people are trained for skills without a guaranteed job at the other end, has not historically been particularly effective. Neither are training or educational opportunities that are unaffordable and thus unattainable to the very people who need them most. That’s crucial because we know that, to have a decent shot at earning a family-sustaining wage, people need some form of post-high school training or education.\n\nExperimentation and bold innovation are key to determining what works — and central to what we do at the Philadelphia Fed’s Economic Growth & Mobility Project. We believe in exploring how our research can be applied to real community problems.\n\nThat’s why a couple of years ago we partnered with stakeholders in Philadelphia to advance a one-of-a-kind “pay for success” job training model that links Comcast, a major employer here, with Philadelphia Works, our local publicly funded job training board.\n\nWhile the program is still in its early stages, the lessons from the model can be applied to partnerships between employers and training organizations across the country. The way it works is that the workforce board, Philadelphia Works, pays for training for new hires up front; the employer then reimburses the board if certain benchmarks, such as staying on the job for six months, are met.\n\nThis is good for both parties: Workers get the skills the employers need, and the workforce organizations know they are training for real job opportunities. You can read more about this exciting and important model in the book.\n\nThe exciting truth is that there are innovative and important programs taking shape all over the country. The book describes many of them, like Career Impact Bond programs that enable workers to upskill affordably, as well as the groundbreaking higher-ed initiatives in Texas and Virginia that link payment for programs to student employment and income after graduation. What these programs have in common is they often represent a mindset shift — away from old models and toward planning around outcomes, building flexibility into contracts, sharing risk, and paying proportionate to impact.\n\nNow, we certainly know that a book won’t do all those things on its own. This book is instead a jumping-off point: a way to highlight an emerging set of principles that define a more nimble training ecosystem that works better for all workers and that truly charts a way to an equitable workforce recovery.\n\nAnd the task is truly urgent. Despite the improving economy, we still have 8 million fewer jobs than we did prior to the pandemic — closer to 11 million, if you assume we would have been creating around 200,000 jobs a month without the pandemic. Tens of millions more are stuck in jobs with only limited opportunities. Now is the moment for bold action.\n\nThe Work Ahead\n\nIn the coming months, we will be convening and supporting local communities through a spotlight series to bring ideas from the book to their situations. If one of the case studies in the book speaks to you — and if you think you could assemble a local team to help adapt that idea and test it — we want to help. The plan is still evolving, but the team behind Workforce Realigned, along with our partners, will support your team with technical assistance, relevant nationwide expertise, and connections with others pursuing similar initiatives. If you want to learn more, check out our webpage for information at workforcerealigned.org. We really want to hear from you.\n\nSo, thank you again for joining us today. Now let’s go out there and make it happen.",

            "content": "Good afternoon! Thank you so much for that introduction. It’s great to be here with this group — and as much as I’d like to have been there in person, it’s pretty great that I didn’t have to fight the traffic on I-95. I’m really looking forward to our discussion today.\n\nMy plan is to talk about where we are economically and then to share some of the Philadelphia Fed’s research on housing that I think will be of particular interest to this group. Then we can open things up for a Q&A.\n\nBut before we do any of that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nMaybe it’s the summer weather or the fact that the Phillies are a couple of games ahead of the Nationals in the NL East, but I’m pleased to note that there is a palpable sense of optimism as we convene. (Just kidding about the Nats part!)\n\nCOVID-19 cases have fallen to levels not seen since the onset of the pandemic. Deaths are finally retreating as well. After a truly painful 2020 and early part of 2021, things do seem to be turning around.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, the economy has largely tracked the path of the virus. And so as COVID-19 has receded, the economy has picked up. Employment, housing, and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last couple of months than many of us — myself included — expected.\n\nAnd recent spending data have once again provided a reminder to never bet against the American consumer. Over the past three months, consumer spending — a component of GDP comprising around 70 percent of the nation’s total economic output — has grown a healthy 2.7 percent.\n\nWe’re digging out of a very deep hole — and we have a long way to go — but for now, I’m anticipating national GDP growth to come in around 7 percent for 2021, before moderating to 3 percent growth next year.\n\nThere are, of course, downside risks, including vaccination hesitancy that precludes true herd immunity as well as the possibility of new COVID-19 variants that render the vaccines less effective. As encouraging as these trends are, the pandemic is not yet over.\n\nThere is no doubt that the cash Congress appropriated to Americans through the Paycheck Protection Program and the more than $3,000 in direct payments to the majority of U.S. households has helped buoy consumer spending during the pandemic.\n\nIn some cases, that meant literal cash — one of our contacts who owns a network of gas stations and convenience stores reported needing extra armored car runs during the week that the latest round of stimulus checks arrived to keep up with demand at his ATMs. Here at the Fed, we’re also starting, once again, to deal with increased demand for coins. So I hope there aren’t too many of you who need quarters to do your laundry; it could be challenging for a while to find them …\n\nOther Americans have socked away what they’ve received. The household savings rate is up sharply, and in March, it was at the second-highest rate on record — 27.7 percent. And others are paying down debt at a rapid clip; bankers have told us that there are clearly some who are struggling with loans and forbearance, but that many of their clients are using this period to catch up on payments they may have fallen behind on.\n\nAll of this is setting the table for a recovery that could be long and durable.\n\nNow, it’s very important to note that the recovery in GDP has so far outpaced the rebound in the labor force.\n\nThe level of employment is still more than 8 million below the prepandemic peak, and that doesn’t account for the roughly 200,000 in monthly gains we probably would have seen without COVID-19. So in a sense, we’re really down around 11 million jobs.\n\nAs the economy continues to reopen, I expect job creation to pick up in the coming months. Given current trajectories, I anticipate the labor force returning to its prepandemic trend sometime next summer — it will be a while, in other words.\n\nThere are myriad reasons that the employment rebound is slightly lagging other indicators.\n\nSome are salutary: During the pandemic, firms became more productive and learned to do more with less. A more productive economy benefits all of us in the long run.\n\nBut what’s puzzling at first glance is that the number of job openings is actually very high. We’ve all seen the Help Wanted signs popping up just about everywhere. And I was just down at the Jersey Shore and had a chance to chat with the manager of a local grocery store. She told me she’s having a hard time finding anybody to work this summer.\n\nWhat accounts for this? We’ve heard from many employers who say that enhanced unemployment benefits are keeping workers at home. If that’s truly a determinative factor, it will be short lived; the extra benefits expire in September.\n\nOther people may have some hesitancy about returning to the workplace until they get vaccinated and until they’re convinced their coworkers are vaccinated. In my District, I know that many people who commute by mass transit are hesitant about getting back on the bus or train.\n\nAnd another factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce during the pandemic is a dearth of childcare options.\n\nThere is a real economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers — leave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of their kids during the workday.\n\nIn Delaware, for instance, it now costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for the care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19 shuttered many schools and childcare centers, further straining families.\n\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue but one that surely requires our attention. Already, one of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the cost of raising them.\n\nMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of young children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out altogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the participation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the pandemic. That is a lot of human capital lying untapped.\n\nInflation and Fed Policy\n\nWith the economy picking up and so much fiscal support and monetary accommodation, there is some upside risk to increased inflation. We will continue to monitor that closely. But for now, I’m forecasting close to 3 percent headline inflation for 2021.\n\nAt the Fed, we’re planning to keep the federal funds rate low for long, but it may be time to at least think about thinking about tapering our $120 billion in monthly Treasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases. This is not something we are going to do suddenly, though. We need to follow the playbook we had after the Great Recession; that is, start to taper the bond purchases slowly. We will remove accommodation carefully and methodically as the economy continues to strengthen.\n\nIt may not make for exciting speeches, but our goal here is to be boring.\n\nResearch on Forbearance\n\nNow, before we move to the Q&A, I would like to share some research from my colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nI’m reminded of the old Saturday Night Live joke about Rhode Island — neither a road nor an island — and I know that not everybody in this group is a woman who works in housing or finance. But I’m sure you’ll find it interesting and important.\n\nMy colleagues in Philadelphia wanted to get to the bottom of two important questions as we assess and seek to remedy the damage wrought by the pandemic.\n\nFirst: What is the extent of racial and income disparities among mortgage borrowers in nonpayment on their mortgages, and how has the pandemic affected these disparities? Then, they wanted to find out who took up forbearance on their mortgages and who missed this important opportunity.\n\nBecause the CARES Act mandates that borrowers in forbearance who aren’t paying on their mortgages still be reported to credit bureaus as if they are paying, these turned out to be surprisingly tricky questions to answer. But through some quite clever methods — my Philadelphia Fed colleagues are nothing if not ingenious — the researchers were able to suss out the data.\n\nHere is what they found: Between April and November 2020, minorities’ and lower-income borrowers’ nonpayment rates were twice as high as for higher-income and White borrowers.\n\nEven if we compare borrowers with the same credit score and the same loan type, Black and Hispanic borrowers have more than 30 percent higher rates of nonpayment, and lower-income borrowers 50 percent higher. Moreover, and importantly, these disparities largely did not exist pre-COVID-19.\n\nIn a sign that the CARES Act was effective, my colleagues found that minority and lower-income borrowers took up forbearances at significantly higher rates than other groups.\n\nThe rub, of course, is that under the CARES Act and subsequent extension from the Biden administration, forbearance lasts only up to 18 months, meaning many borrowers will be coming off soon. That’s concerning, given that as of mid-May, about 35 percent of people who went into forbearance in the first place are still in it — an estimated 2.2 million borrowers.\n\nThat presents a challenge to borrowers first and foremost, of course. But also to lenders. And my colleagues suggest a possible solution to this problem.\n\nThe proposed fix would extend the term of the loan and reduce interest payments, for payment-reduction modifications of 20 or 30 percent in total for those who have a high payment burden and little equity in their house. In the case of a 20 percent reduction, these modifications would cost lenders about $1.5 billion. For 30 percent reductions, the cost would be $4.3 billion.\n\nThe upshot? Only a fraction of the costs of broader government-assistance programs enacted in 2020 and 2021 could keep distressed borrowers in their homes. That strikes me as something worth thinking hard about.\n\nSo, thank you again for having me, and now I’m happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome! It’s an honor to be here at this, the Federal Reserve’s sixth virtual session on racism and the economy. This series, sponsored by all 12 Reserve Banks, examines the economic impact of structural racism and advances bold ideas and concrete actions to achieve an economy that makes opportunity available to everyone and that achieves maximum employment. I’m thrilled to be here and delighted that we have such a robust turnout — an indication of how urgent this issue is.\n\nBut before we begin, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe tragic events of last year threw our country’s tortured relationship with racism into stark relief. The COVID-19 crisis, in both its health and economic effects, disproportionately impacted people and communities of color. And the death of George Floyd spurred civil unrest that illuminated the structural racism that remains stubbornly pervasive in our society.\n\nBut even though last year’s events brought structural racism to the forefront of the country’s consciousness, they were hardly novel. They were instead part of a long and painful history that has indelibly stained American history.\n\nIndeed, we are convening one day after the 100-year anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, an act of racial terrorism in which a White mob destroyed a thriving Black neighborhood — “the Black Wall Street” — in that Oklahoma city.\n\nIn addition to the lives lost, the Tulsa massacre destroyed scores of small businesses, which are the focus of today’s vitally important session. Entrepreneurship and small business ownership provide opportunities for Americans to generate wealth and build thriving communities. They are also an essential plank in building an equitable workforce recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and an economy that works for all Americans.\n\nSmall businesses are drivers of job growth. As of 2018, there were more than 30 million American small businesses, meaning they employ fewer than 500 people. Those small businesses collectively employ nearly 60 million people or about half of the country’s private workforce.\n\nAnd crucially, small businesses can be an engine for building a more racially equitable economy: More than 8 million small businesses are owned by racial minorities. Here in Philadelphia, we are particularly sensitive to the concerns of these vital businesses. In Philadelphia — the nation’s largest predominantly Black city — fully 99.7 percent of businesses are small businesses.\n\nBut let’s be honest. These statistics, impressive as they are, belie the very real structural barriers that stymie entrepreneurship among racial and ethnic minorities. For instance, despite its large African American population, only 6 percent of small businesses here in Philadelphia are helmed by Black owners and that includes sole proprietorships.\n\nOne real problem is a lack of banking relationships. This became painfully obvious during the administration of the CARES Act’s PPP loans, which were largely funneled through preexisting relationships between lenders and business owners. PPP loans have been a vital lifeline for small businesses during the pandemic as local governments shuttered businesses and consumers stayed home.\n\nBut they weren’t distributed equitably. In fact, not even close.\n\nAccording to data submitted by applicants to the Small Business Administration, which managed the program, during the height of the pandemic, fully 83 percent of PPP loans went to businesses owned by White entrepreneurs. Black business owners, by contrast, received only 1.9 percent of the loans issued. A separate study found that, not only did Black business owners apply for PPP loans at a lower rate than other groups, their applications were also turned down at higher rates — even when controlling for revenue and credit.\n\nIt’s clear that profound structural barriers are limiting minority entrepreneurs from accessing capital.\n\nAll too often shut out from traditional lenders offering favorable rates, Black business owners are forced to turn to predatory lenders. That means that money that could be spent on buying goods and services, renting storefronts, or hiring workers goes toward interest payments. And the entire economy suffers for it.\n\nThere are exciting and important efforts afoot to redress these disparities, which is one of the reasons today’s session is so important. CDFIs, for instance, are a crucial tool for channeling capital into minority communities. And new venture capital funds that focus specifically on minority-owned businesses are another exciting development.\n\nBut piecemeal efforts cannot — and will not — be the entire solution to this problem.\n\nIt will take all of us — state and local governments, the banking community, and, yes, the Federal Reserve — to break down these barriers and build an equitable and durable economic recovery.\n\nFor our part, at the Philadelphia Fed, we are launching our 2021 Reinventing Our Communities cohort program, in which community cohorts in nine cities across the country will work together to frame, contextualize, and organize in order to spark an equitable small business recovery and to strengthen support for small business owners of color.\n\nOur hope is that through peer learning the Fed will provide communities with the tools to identify structural racism and then create a plan to address it tailored to where they are.\n\nNow, you’re about to hear from a series of speakers who will illuminate racism’s effect on minority entrepreneurs — and this is crucial — on how we can work creatively and urgently to disrupt the status quo.\n\nDr. Robert E. Weems Jr., a distinguished professor of business history at Wichita State University and our keynote speaker, will share his insights on impediments to minority small business owners and solutions to overcome them.\n\nOur disrupters panel, featuring three dynamic leaders, will pitch and interrogate radical solutions for addressing racism in entrepreneurship.\n\nAnd then we’ll hear from three entrepreneur/activists, who will reflect on the solutions discussed and the implications for their real-life experiences as businesspeople.\n\nFinally, you’ll hear reflections from my colleagues, the Reserve Bank presidents from Dallas, Chicago, and Atlanta, to reflect on what we heard today.\n\nI’m really excited about today’s program.\n\nSo, again, thank you for joining us today. And now, let me turn things over to my Fed colleague Neel Kashkari who will introduce Dr. Weems. Neel?\n\nNote: This speech was prerecorded for the Racism and the Economy: Focus on Entrepreneurship event.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be here. And a special thanks to our staff at the Philadelphia Fed who organized this symposium, our distinguished panelists, and, of course, all of you for taking the time to join us.\n\nAs a recovering academic, I’m particularly excited about today’s program. The future of higher ed is obviously of personal importance to me … but it’s not just that. It’s also crucial to the future of our country. We’ve assembled a terrific assortment of panelists today, who will — I am sure — provide unparalleled insight into the challenges and opportunities facing the sector. How lucky we all are to be here … in some form.\n\nBut now, before we begin, I have to say something I never needed to say in my lecture hall days. That’s what we call the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed has invested significantly in research in higher education and education finance over the past couple of decades. Our interdisciplinary, applied research group, the Consumer Finance Institute, which is sponsoring this event, is just the most recent strategic initiative in this area.\n\nOur Bank’s strong interest in the subject is partly geographic. Now, some may like to call the Boston area the “Athens of America,” but here in Philadelphia, we are at least Alexandria. Some 80 colleges and universities populate the Greater Philadelphia area. The two largest employers in the region are universities and their associated health systems — the University of Pennsylvania and Thomas Jefferson University. These anchor institutions — comprising both eds and meds — are of vital economic importance to the District we serve at the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nBut that does not make us unique — far from it, in fact. And for all its civic virtues, higher education is also an industry whose economic effects are felt coast to coast.\n\nIndeed, in the fall of 2019, there were approximately 4,000 postsecondary educational institutions in the U.S., counting both four-year and two-year institutions and nonprofits as well as for-profits.\n\nTheir economic impact is, quite obviously, sizable. The National Center for Education Statistics counts more than 4 million people employed in higher education. Those employed in the higher education sector earn higher-than-median wages.\n\nNor can we forget the students and the value they bring to the communities where they study and socialize. As of last fall, 19.7 million students were enrolled in America’s colleges and universities, 12 million of whom were attending full-time. Right around now, as the academic year draws to a close, colleges and universities are getting ready to confer 1,988,000 bachelor’s degrees, 983,000 associate’s degrees, 833,000 master’s degrees, and 187,000 doctorates. That’s a whole lot of people entering the workforce better prepared than they were before.\n\nAnd then there are the millions of Americans whose livelihood depends indirectly on higher education. Think of the restaurants, coffee shops — and, let’s be honest, grungy bars — that cluster near campuses, as well as the legions of suppliers of books, accommodations, transportation, furniture, utilities, technology services, and so much more, that depend on colleges and universities. There’s a reason the notion of the “college town” evokes thriving small businesses and vibrant communities. Colleges and universities have a serious multiplier effect.\n\nAll of which is to say, the economic impact of the higher education sector is felt by far more than the already massive numbers of people who are employed or enrolled in it. The entire country is touched by it.\n\nFurthermore, for all its problems — many of which we will delve into today — higher education, in all its forms, remains a critical rung on the ladder to the middle class in this country.\n\nA bachelor’s degree is worth $2.8 million on average in career earnings, according to Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. Bachelor’s degree holders earn 31 percent more than those with an associate’s degree and 84 percent more than those with a high school diploma. Moreover, this so-called college premium has risen in recent decades. In 1999, bachelor’s degree holders earned just 75 percent more than those with a high school diploma. The earnings gap between those with degrees and those without is only rising.\n\nAnd that is precisely why today’s symposium on the financial viability of the higher education industry is so important. The financial health and stability of these institutions is of the greatest import not just to educators and students, but to all of us.\n\nI can’t wait to hear from our panels of state education leaders, researchers, and college and university presidents. I only wish we could be serving lunch. And I’ll be back later to speak more on today’s topic and open up the Q&A.\n\nSo again, thanks so much for joining us and a warm welcome on behalf of the Philadelphia Fed. And now, I’d like to turn things over to Rajeev Darolia of the University of Kentucky, who will lead our first panel.\n\nHello again! What a great program this has been. I want to say thank you, again, to the organizers of this symposium, the panelists, and all of you for joining us.\n\nAlso, I’m not sure if I want to say this, but I know I have to. It’s a rerun of what I said this morning: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday’s presentations have underlined two fundamental facts about the higher education sector that indicate why we are approaching a crisis point. One: Higher education is, as I sketched out a bit this morning, deeply important to the civic and economic life of our country. And two: That very system is in peril.\n\nEven before the pandemic, long-standing secular trends were threatening the industry. One was the ever-increasing cost of a college education, whose persistent rise in tuition and fees has been outpacing inflation for decades. Low productivity growth has been a primary driver of this phenomenon.\n\nClosely related has been the explosion of student debt. The more expensive education has become — and the less support the public sector has offered to students — the more they have had to borrow to finance their education. Americans now owe more than $1.7 trillion in student loans, far outpacing credit card debt and second only to mortgages in total borrowing.\n\nDemographics threaten the industry, too. The traditional college-age segment is actually in decline. Those enrolled in higher education institutions now tend to be older and have lower incomes than before. It’s something to marvel at: College education has become more expensive at a time when the customer base has become less able to afford it.\n\nTechnological advances, meanwhile, have brought forth increased competition to the traditional higher ed sector. Low-cost, easily accessible online education represents a severe threat to an industry with high fixed costs. This is especially worrisome when, as we heard from one of our panelists today, the quality of online education as a complete substitute for in-person learning remains questionable.\n\nThere were bright spots like health care. As the country ages and medical technology advances, universities with medical campuses attached have prospered. But for the most part, the trends were grim.\n\nAnd as we’ve learned today, COVID-19 has only served to strengthen those forces that are threatening the higher education industry as we know it. Cost pressures are intensifying at campuses from coast to coast. Online distance learning brought on by the pandemic may have only served to further undermine the value proposition of expensive traditional institutions. And unlike in prior downturns, enrollment at community colleges has actually fallen during the pandemic as people have had to juggle family and job responsibilities under unprecedented strain.\n\nMore pain is, unfortunately, almost certainly on the way. My colleagues at the Philadelphia Fed, using historical data on how states responded to previous economic downturns and contemporaneous measures of the severity of the pandemic and its economic effects, have projected revenue shortfalls of between $70 billion and $115 billion over the coming five-year period across the sector. Our researchers forecast that 80 percent of all institutions will face revenue shortfalls, with HBCUs, public colleges, and institutions with fewer than 1,000 students facing the heaviest fiscal burdens.\n\nThe truth is, far from being the “unkindest cut,” state governments have shown little hesitance to cut spending on higher education. Nor are the cuts precisely aligned with revenue declines. To take a hypothetical situation: A fall of 10 percent in tax revenues could lead to a 15 percent slash in higher education spending, for instance. Unlike K‒12 education or roads and bridges, higher ed makes an easy target.\n\nI recall vividly learning this firsthand when I was president of the University of Delaware (UD). A powerful state legislator had called me into this office in Dover to let me know our appropriation would be slashed even though that would mean, by necessity, a hike in tuition. A little later on that same day, I sat in a public hearing while that very same legislator attacked me for … raising tuition.\n\nSo there’s your poli-sci lesson for the day.\n\nAs we emerge from this pandemic, I want to call on federal and state governments — and American society — to recommit to public postsecondary education, which remains the indispensable tool for economic and social mobility and to educating our citizenry. Higher education is, as I stated earlier, an industry. But it is also a public good.\n\nI am not — and I stress not — calling for blank checks. Colleges and universities need to meet the public sector halfway. They must urgently bend the cost curve. For society to recommit to them, it is incumbent on them to change.\n\nI also want to stress that this commitment must extend beyond traditional four-year colleges — and their football programs. Many state legislators seem more concerned with sports than anything else in education.\n\nThe country should be investing in the totality of post-high school training and education.\n\nIndeed, there are now many exciting alternatives to traditional four-year colleges or even community colleges. Coming from a former university president, this probably sounds like Ronald McDonald admonishing you to lay off the french fries. But the truth is that many Americans don’t need a traditional four-year college degree to enjoy a prosperous life. What they need are the skills that will propel them into middle-class jobs. For my dad, my uncles, and my brother, that was pipefitting. And for many, that’s still a great option. For others, it will be something else.\n\nMany skills today are gained through a variety of short-term programs that do not lead to degrees but can provide marketable new skills. These courses can be as short as two months, and workers — many of whom are in their midcareer and are looking to retool, stand to benefit. (The quality of these programs can vary widely, however.)\n\nAccording to a recent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in enrollees’ careers: Certificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in fields like information technology and legal studies. Indeed, the study found some certificates can yield earnings that rival those of bachelor’s degrees in other fields. My electrician happens to live in my neighborhood, and he owns his own business and makes a great living without a four-year degree.\n\nShort-term credentials can be gained in many venues, from traditional community colleges, to private academies like computer-coding boot camps. The training can be done both online and at brick-and-mortar institutions.\n\nOf course, even as we look for creative ways to employ short-term programs as an alternative to traditional degrees, we must ensure equal opportunity to all types of degree and non-degree programs. We must not allow for a two-tiered system of higher education to flourish, with low income and minority students funneled into experimental programs while facing barriers to obtaining traditional degrees. There are also public‒private partnerships designed to provide pipelines of talent to the private sector. The way the latter works is that companies essentially outsource a portion of their employee training to outside vendors, using a “pay for success” model. That means the company reimburses the entity that paid for the training in the first place — say, the local publicly funded job board — if the new hire hits certain benchmarks, like staying on the job for six months. It can be an effective way to entice corporations to hire from populations they may find too risky or for which they lack sufficient familiarity, particularly those in underserved communities. The workers will benefit, of course, but so will the companies that will have access to an undertapped pool of talent.\n\nFor many others, a four-year degree is still going to be the best option. But these institutions require a radical overhaul.\n\nBegin by asking: What value proposition do universities offer? Fundamentally, they are offering something quite profound. Rather than a certain set of skills or a discrete body of facts, universities instead are pitching the promise of critical skills to learn how to learn for a lifetime.\n\nA few years ago, I authored a paper examining the systems that universities use to deliver this education.\n\nOn most campuses, I recounted, classes are scheduled three days a week for an hour each day, twice a week for one-and-a-half hours, or once a week in three-hour blocks. Room assignments are optimized to fit these scheduled slots, and classes are scheduled to meet student demand — although often class times are more likely to reflect faculty preference. Classrooms are designed to meet the schedule, which in turn is derived from optimizing the use of classrooms.\n\nIn sum, the entire system on a college campus is designed to optimize teaching, where teaching is defined as being in a classroom, for example, twice a week for one-and-a-half hours at a time. Over the decades, we have built optimized teaching factories.\n\nBut what if, I asked, rather than design teaching factories, universities instead focused on creating learning-centric institutions? Institutions that are efficient — and by definition — affordable.\n\nIt could mean replacing vestigial general education requirements — which are too often in place to protect privileged fiefdoms in various academic departments — with intelligently designed common core programs like those in place at some of our country’s most prestigious universities and colleges.\n\nIt could mean the selective and intelligent use of technology to achieve economies of scale as Arizona State University, Georgia Tech, and others are doing with quite impressive results. But universities must keep in mind that online education is a means, not an end in and of itself.\n\nIt could mean mergers and acquisitions. Here in Philadelphia, Saint Joseph’s University and the University of the Sciences are proposing to merge, a move that will promote efficiency and bolster the combined schools’ presence in health sciences, a major growth industry.\n\nIt could mean rethinking the structure of university faculty and contemplating, rather than simply loading up on teachers’ assistants, the use of full-time nontenured faculty to reduce labor costs.\n\nThe health-care industry is an interesting example: It has successfully reduced costs using nurse practitioners in the place of physicians for many routine tasks. It has also embraced telemedicine, particularly during the pandemic.\n\nIt could — and should — mean all of the above, and much more that I haven’t even contemplated, because time is of the essence and the pressures are very real and only set to worsen.\n\nThere are also great opportunities to more closely integrate four-year and community colleges in ways that promote efficiency and better serve students. Everyone in higher education knows that far too many students, through no fault of their own, enter demanding institutions without adequate preparation.\n\nMany of these students have unfortunately attended high schools that left them ill prepared for college-level work or have had life challenges that have left them unprepared for the demands of a selective college or university. That can be disastrous, because once a student falls behind academically, it’s very, very difficult to catch up.\n\nAt UD, the Associate in Arts Program not only provides a pipeline of students into the university, but it also makes sure they are poised to succeed once they get there.\n\nThe way the Associate in Arts Program works is this: UD courses are taught by UD faculty in small classes in Delaware Tech buildings throughout the state. (Delaware Tech is the state’s public community college.)\n\nStudents receive an associate’s degree in University Studies by earning credits in the core courses that are required of all undergraduates, and then, they transition to UD’s main campus to earn their bachelor’s degree. Most full-time students receive money from the state to cover their tuition, demonstrating the potential for meaningful state support for well-designed programs. The program is high touch, with small class sizes and lots of interaction between faculty and students.\n\nI’m thrilled to report that 64 percent of students in the program graduate with their associate’s degree within three years — well above the national average of around 33 percent. Of those, 88 percent go onto the main campus at UD, and nearly 80 percent of those graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\n\nBecause the program is taught by UD faculty, the transition from an associate’s to bachelor’s degree becomes something approaching seamless. A member of the English faculty who is teaching in the Associate in Arts Program knows exactly what her students are prepared for once they enter an English course on the main campus.\n\nYou know, a long time ago, when people used to ask me what they should study, I would tell them to follow their passion. I realize now that this was precisely the wrong answer.\n\nNow I say, pick a subject you find really difficult. And study that.\n\nBecause ultimately, the purpose of education is not simply to learn what you need to know, but more fundamentally how to think. That’s just as true for somebody earning an electrical engineering certificate as it is for another person pursuing a philosophy doctorate.\n\nIt’s also true for me: I benefited from a great education in engineering and economics at the University of Pennsylvania, and now I’m a central banker, formulating monetary policy. My education didn’t just teach me how to build roads and bridges, it taught me how to reason.\n\nA society where people know how to reason — how to think — strikes me as one that is bound to be a successful one. Higher education’s value is not just the economic boost it provides to our country, though that is incredibly important. Its value also lies in teaching our fellow Americans how to think.\n\nSo again, thank you everyone for being here today. And now I’m happy to take a few questions.",

            "content": "Good afternoon! It’s great to be back with this group. I’m really looking forward to our discussion today — especially the Q&A portion. And given that you’re an audience of CFAs, I’ve come expecting some really tough, forensic questions, such as …  what on Earth is going on with the Phillies?\n\nToday I’d like to offer you a few thoughts on where we are economically. I also plan to talk a bit about how we can build a more equitable and sustainable economy as we recover from the pandemic.\n\nBut before we do that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSetting the Phillies aside, I’m pleased to note that there is a palpable sense of optimism as we convene. Last year and the early part of 2021 were really, really tough — and tragic for millions of Americans — but things have noticeably begun to turn around in our area and across the country.\n\nEconomic data like employment, housing, and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last couple of months than many of us — myself included — expected. And recent spending data have once again provided a reminder to never bet against the American consumer. In March alone, consumer spending — a component of GDP comprising around 70 percent of the nation’s total economic output — surged 4.2 percent.\n\nWe can credit increased vaccinations, falling COVID-19 case rates, and a huge dose of fiscal stimulus for the reviving national economy. We’re digging out of a very deep hole — and we have a long way to go — but for now, I’m anticipating national GDP growth to come in around 7 percent for 2021, before moderating to 3 percent growth next year.\n\nThere are, of course, downside risks, including vaccination hesitancy that precludes true herd immunity as well as the possibility of new COVID-19 variants that render the vaccines less efficacious. The tragic situation in India is a reminder that even as the situation in the U.S. improves, much of the world is still in the worst throes of the pandemic.\n\nCloser to home, there is no doubt that the cash Congress appropriated to Americans through the Paycheck Protection Program and the more than $3,000 in direct payments to the majority of U.S. households has helped buoy consumer spending during the pandemic.\n\nIn some cases, that meant literal cash — one of our contacts who owns a network of gas stations and convenience stores reported needing extra armored car runs during the week the latest round of stimulus checks arrived to keep up with demand at his ATMs. Here at the Fed, we’re also starting, once again, to deal with increased demand for coins. So I hope there aren’t too many of you who need quarters to do your laundry; it could be challenging for a while to find them …\n\nOther Americans have squirreled away what they’ve received. The household savings rate is up sharply, and in March, it was at the second-highest rate on record — 27.6 percent. And others are paying down debt at a rapid clip; bankers have told us that there are clearly some who are struggling with loans and forbearance, but that many of their clients are using this period to catch up on payments they may have fallen behind on.\n\nAll of this is setting the table for a recovery that could be long and durable.\n\nIt’s important to note that the recovery in GDP has so far outpaced the rebound in the labor force. The level of employment is still more than 8 million below the prepandemic peak, and that doesn’t account for the roughly 200,000 in monthly gains we probably would have seen without COVID-19. April’s jobs report, which came in at only 266,000 new jobs, was extremely disappointing.\n\nGiven that the underlying fundamentals of the economy look so strong, April’s numbers were probably an outlier, however, and I expect job creation to pick up in the coming months. At this point, I anticipate the labor force returning to its prepandemic trend sometime next summer.\n\nThere are myriad reasons that the employment rebound is slightly lagging other indicators. Some are salutary: During the pandemic, firms became more productive and learned to do more with less. A more productive economy benefits all of us in the long run.\n\nBut other people may have some hesitancy about returning to the workplace until they get vaccinated, and they’re convinced their coworkers are vaccinated. There’s also great inconsistency across industries; in the service sector, hospitality and tourism jobs are still down significantly because their business has yet to return in significant numbers.\n\nAnother factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce is a dearth of childcare options.\n\nThere is a real economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers — leave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of their kids during the workday.\n\nLike quality education, affordable childcare is not merely a “nice to have” — it’s an economic necessity.\n\nIn Delaware, for instance, it now costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for the care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19 shuttered many schools and childcare centers, further straining families.\n\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue but one that surely requires our attention. Already, one of the most oft-cited reasons couples give for having fewer children than they say they want is the cost of raising them.\n\nMy colleagues at the Minneapolis Fed have found that, at the outset of the pandemic, many parents of young children left the labor force — 3.4 percent of fathers and 2.9 percent of mothers dropped out altogether. But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the participation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the pandemic. That is a lot of human capital lying untapped. The Philadelphia Fed, in partnership with the Delaware Chamber of Commerce, is piloting a Research in Action Lab focused on providing childcare options precisely because of this issue.\n\nFor now, Fed policy is going to hold steady.\n\nWe’ll keep the federal funds rate very low and continue making more than $100 billion in monthly Treasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases. While the economic situation is improving, recovery is still a work in progress, and there’s no reason to withdraw support yet.\n\nWith so much fiscal support and monetary accommodation, there is some upside risk to increased inflation, and we will continue to monitor that closely. But for now, I’m forecasting 2.3 percent headline inflation for 2021 with core inflation at 2 percent.\n\nLastly, before we move to the Q&A, I’d like to take a moment to tell you a little bit about a new tool the Philadelphia Fed recently launched that I think you will find very interesting — and important.\n\nOne of the ways we can ensure that the coming recovery is both equitable and durable is to get more people into middle-class jobs. And so, the tool came out of the work done by researchers at the Philadelphia Fed and the Cleveland Fed who began by asking a question: How do we transition workers in low-paying, unstable jobs into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the median wage and that don’t require a college degree.\n\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of the people who currently hold those low-opportunity jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\n\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay differences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in salary.\n\nWe’ve recently launched an interactive online tool — the Occupational Mobility Explorer — to help workers and employers make those transitions. Once you are in Explorer, you can select your geographic location and current occupation, and you will find a variety of jobs that require similar skills and pay at least 10 percent more in wages.\n\nFor example, receptionists here in the Philadelphia area will find that they possess many of the skills necessary to become a medical secretary, a job that pays about 27 percent more — on average, a bump in salary from around $30,000 to $38,000.\n\nBill collectors in the Philadelphia area could boost their salary 45 percent, from an average of about $38,000 to nearly $55,000 by becoming a credit counselor — with the added bonus that people will actually want to answer the phone when you call.\n\nThe tool can also be used by workforce development practitioners, community colleges, and, of course, the general public. It can help with reskilling programs, employee recruitment, and hiring practices as millions of workers seek to reenter the job market as we emerge from the pandemic. There’s a lot of talent out there that we as a society would be foolish to leave on the sidelines.\n\nSo, thanks so much again for having me. And now I’m happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be back in Delaware. And thanks to the magic of virtual conferences, I didn’t even have to fight traffic on I-95 to be here with you.\n\nI’m really looking forward to our discussion today — especially the Q&A portion. But before we get to that, I’d like to offer you a few thoughts on where we are economically, both nationally and in Delaware. I’d also like to talk a bit about how we can build a more equitable and sustainable economy as we recover from the pandemic.\n\nBut before we do that, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe State of the Economy\n\nI last addressed this group almost a year ago. At the time, this “new normal” we’ve all become accustomed to was still just that: new. Nonessential businesses were shuttered, COVID-19 cases were spiking, and vaccines still seemed only a distant hope.\n\nLike most first-year anniversaries, ours is a fairly happy one.\n\nThat’s because, although last year and the early part of 2021 were really, really tough — and tragic for millions of Americans — things have noticeably begun to turn around.\n\nEconomic data like employment and manufacturing figures came in stronger over the last couple of months than many of us expected. While I’m concerned about the downside risks from COVID-19 variants and the alarming virus spikes in states like Michigan, I still think that a combination of increased vaccinations, falling COVID-19 case rates, and a huge dose of fiscal stimulus should buoy the national economy. For now, I’m expecting GDP growth to come in around 5 to 6 percent in 2021. I would expect the labor market to parallel GDP growth and unemployment to fall throughout this year.\n\nFor now, Fed policy is going to hold steady. We’ll keep the federal funds rate very low and continue making more than $100 billion in monthly Treasury bond and mortgage-backed securities purchases. While the economic situation is improving, recovery is still in its early stages, and there’s no reason to withdraw support yet.\n\nEconomic data for Delaware, meanwhile, indicate a real recovery is underway here as well. But it’s very much a work in progress.\n\nPayroll data show that the state has recovered more than 60 percent of the jobs lost at the beginning of the pandemic — but we’re still around 24,500 jobs below where we were before COVID-19. That’s enough for the unemployment rate in the state to have fallen from 13.4 percent a year ago to 6.3 percent now. That’s encouraging, of course, though in February 2020, the unemployment rate in Delaware was 4.5 percent. Labor force participation is similarly improving, but it’s still down from pre-pandemic highs. It now sits at 61.3 percent, up from last April’s 60.1 percent, but down from last February’s 62.7 percent.\n\nThose broad numbers mask vast disparities across different segments of the economy, of course.\n\nFinance and insurance — collectively responsible for nearly 30 percent of Delaware’s GDP — have remained basically unscathed, a remarkable development for those of us who recall the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe same cannot be said for tourism and hospitality. Net revenue at Delaware’s small businesses in the leisure and hospitality sector continues to hover around 50 percent of prepandemic numbers. But even here, there are hopeful signs. The Rehoboth Beach‒Dewey Beach area is reporting an uptick in demand for weekend accommodations — demand now outstrips prepandemic times, likely a sign that people who may have traveled farther afield in other years are now sticking closer to home. And open job postings in hospitality and leisure have been climbing for months.\n\nManufacturing, collectively responsible for about 6 percent of the state’s economic production, is also showing an increase in hiring, though it’s still just slightly below the prepandemic trend. In a sign of increased productivity, the manufacturing of chemical products, as well as food, beverages, and tobacco products, are all up from 2019, despite a slightly smaller workforce.\n\nAnd lastly, it may be bad news if you happen to be a chicken, but good news for Delaware’s people: Agriculture has remained steady during this period. The number of operating farms in the state has not changed during the pandemic.\n\nIntroducing the Occupational Mobility Explorer\n\nSo, a recovery is clearly underway. And with that comes a great opportunity for all of us. We can shape what’s coming to build a recovery that is equitable and durable.\n\nLet me tell you a little bit about a new tool the Philadelphia Fed recently launched that I think you will find very interesting — and hopefully useful for your businesses.\n\nThe tool came out of work done by researchers at the Philadelphia Fed and the Cleveland Fed. They began by asking a question: How do we transition workers in low-paying, unstable jobs into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that pay above the median wage and that don’t require a college degree.\n\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of the people who currently hold those low-opportunity jobs.

Once you are in Explorer, you can select your geographic location and current occupation, and you will find a variety of jobs that require similar skills and pay at least 10 percent more in wages.\n\nFor example, receptionists here in the Philadelphia‒Wilmington area will find that they possess many of the skills necessary to become a medical secretary, a job that pays about 26 percent more — on average, a bump in salary from around $30,000 to $38,000. Bill collectors in the Wilmington area could bump their salary 45 percent, from an average of about $38,000 to nearly $55,000 by becoming a credit counselor — with the added bonus that people will actually want to answer the phone when you call.\n\nThe tool can also be used by workforce development practitioners, community colleges, and, of course, all of you. The Explorer can help inform your reskilling programs, employee recruitment, and hiring practices as millions of workers seek to reenter the job market as we emerge from the pandemic. There’s a lot of talent out there that we would be foolish to leave on the sidelines.\n\nAffordable Childcare\n\nAnother factor that has driven far too many talented people out of the workforce is a dearth of childcare options. The Philadelphia Fed, in partnership with the Delaware Chamber, is piloting a Research in Action Lab focused on providing childcare options. I know we are planning a full briefing sometime this summer, so I don’t want to play the spoiler.\n\nBut I do want to point out the economic cost that all of us incur when people — and let’s be frank, mostly mothers — leave the labor force because they can’t find an affordable option for taking care of their kids during the workday. Like quality education, affordable childcare is not merely a “nice to have” — it’s an economic necessity.\n\nAnd it’s an expensive one. Here in Delaware, it costs the median-earning family 20 percent of their income to pay for the care of a child under 5 years old. That’s a heavy burden — even before COVID-19 shuttered many schools and childcare centers, further straining families.\n\nMaking childcare more affordable is a complex issue, but one that surely requires our attention.

But in the ensuing year, most fathers have returned to the labor force, while the participation rate of mothers of young children is still down 2.8 percentage points from before the pandemic. As with all those workers with skills languishing in low-opportunity jobs, too much human capital is lying untapped.\n\nSo, again, thank you so much for having me here. Hopefully this fall I’ll see all of you when I’m cheering for the Blue Hens — in person.\n\nAnd now, I’m happy to take questions.",

            "content": "Hello! It’s really great to be here, and I’m thrilled that we have such a large turnout. The interest in this event was so large, in fact, that here at the Fed, we had our own fintech issue as we were organizing it: We had to cap attendance to protect bandwidth!\n\nThat’s a good problem to have, of course, and I think it really speaks to the terrific program that the staff at the Philadelphia Fed has put together for all of us — and to the robust interest in fostering a dialogue between fintech platforms and community banks from all over the country.\n\nSo, again, welcome. I just regret that for those of you on the West Coast this program has to be BYOB — Bring Your Own Breakfast.\n\nNow, before we proceed, I have to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Importance of Community Banks\n\nHere at the Fed we wear many hats: We’re a bank, a supervisor and regulator of other banks, and the largest collection of economists in the world. We have the ability to lend money, to foster payments and settlements, and to promote consumer protection and community development.\n\nWe also have the power to convene. And that is precisely our aim this week: to provide a forum for open discussion among community bankers, bank regulators, and the fintech industry. We’re delighted you’re here to learn about the new tools available to improve risk valuations and to enhance the customer experience for clients — among other exciting new technologies.\n\nI’m particularly glad that we have so many CEOs and CTOs of small community banks here today. While I probably don’t need to belabor the importance of community banks to this particular audience, I think it sometimes gets lost just how central community banks are to our economy — and indeed, to American society.\n\nJust consider the numbers. There are more than 4,800 active community bank charters across the country. And of those, almost exactly half are in communities with fewer than 50,000 residents. Community banks — those with $10 billion or less in assets — collectively hold more than $3 trillion in assets. You don’t need to rewatch It’s a Wonderful Life for the hundredth time to get a sense of how vitally important these institutions are.\n\nRisks and Opportunities\n\nCOVID-19 and its associated economic effects have also emphasized the importance of community banks. But they have also heightened the risks to the sector in a world where more and more business is conducted online.\n\nGiven their strong relationships with local businesses, community banks were absolutely essential to operating the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which has kept so many small businesses afloat during the shutdowns. According to my Fed colleague, Governor Michelle Bowman, community banks have made up about 40 percent of the total value of PPP loans issued. It’s probably no exaggeration to say that PPP would have failed without community banks’ support.\n\nBut economic shutdowns imposed to curtail the spread of COVID-19 — particularly those that shuttered bank branches — have also demonstrated just how important digitization is and the perils of falling behind on fintech.\n\nOnline platforms have gobbled up an increasing number of home mortgages, for instance — particularly as COVID-19 has deemphasized the importance of the in-person interactions that are the bread and butter of community banking. I would encourage community bankers to explore digitization opportunities for your institution and customers, as well as innovative opportunities that align with your strategic plans.\n\nI understand, of course, that there are challenges. Smaller banks often simply don’t have the workforce or the cash to first, research and investigate, and then to ultimately invest in costly fintech platforms. They lack the economies of scale that bigger banks enjoy. Set-up costs can be prohibitive. And, to be frank, there are occasional cultural differences between the “move fast and break things” ethos of many fintech suppliers and the more risk-averse sensibilities of bankers.\n\nAnd those risks are real. Consider the astonishing rapidity of technological development. There are serious and understandable concerns that a year or two after making an expensive fintech investment, the technology will already become obsolete. You don’t want to be stuck with a bunch of buggy whips a year before the invention of the Model T.\n\nAnd there can be a hesitancy to embrace new technologies on the client side, too, of course. A banker in our area recently told me that despite her bank’s investment in fintech — and even with her branch offices closed — many clients still use the drive-through windows to do things they could easily do at home. They’re even willing to wait for 20 minutes in their car to do so. Although, given the pandemic conditions that have kept many of us at home for a year, I certainly understand the need to get out of the house.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is precisely because of these opportunities and these risks that this symposium is such a great opportunity for all of us. Constructive dialogue between fintech firms and community banks offers a path forward for both. We can listen, and we can learn from each other.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, for its part, is very supportive of innovation. We’re here to convene, to support, and to supervise.\n\nThanks again and enjoy the event.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s really great to be here. The kind of research we’re going to be discussing today is absolutely critical to building a healthy economy that supports all Americans — and just as important as the work the Fed does on monetary policy and interest rates. So I’m really pleased to see so many of you here.\n\nI’m also happy to be here on this day in particular. Today is the 156th anniversary of the founding of the Freedman’s Savings Bank, which was created after the Civil War to help develop the financial independence of African Americans following the abolition of slavery.\n\nNow, before I proceed, whenever I’m talking about any of the work the Fed does, I have to provide the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIn a few minutes, you’re going to hear all about our Occupational Mobility Explorer, a truly exciting tool that I think will help to move the needle when it comes to helping transition people into family-sustaining careers. We know that it’s not just a skills gap that is holding many people back, but it’s an opportunity gap as well. The Explorer is designed with that in mind.\n\nBut before we do that, I think it’s worth addressing why the Occupational Mobility Explorer is so important, particularly for Black and Latino communities here in our area and across the country. Simply put, Black and Latino workers are struggling more than others. That’s a trend that long predated the pandemic — and that has also only been heightened by it.\n\nIn the state of Pennsylvania, the Black unemployment rate is 17.2 percent, and the White unemployment rate is 7.8 percent. Labor participation is also lower among African Americans than other groups.\n\nAnd across the country, the picture looks grimly similar: Nationally, Black unemployment stands at 9.2 percent versus 5.7 percent for White workers. Meanwhile, the country’s unemployment rate for Latinos is 8.7 percent.\n\nWomen across all races have also been severely impacted by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million women have dropped out of the formal labor force since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nEven with some hopeful signs as virus cases fall and the economy continues to reopen, I’m concerned that, as the broader economy climbs upward, far too many workers are being left behind. As of late last year, 75 percent of GDP losses from the COVID-19 pandemic had been recouped — but only 60 percent of job losses had been reversed. Those job losses have been concentrated among racial and ethnic minorities and women. We also know that, after prior recessions, it took longer for Black and Latino unemployment rates to drop than it did for other groups.\n\nStructural barriers have impeded the progress of minorities and women since even before the founding of the country. And today, forces like job segregation, inequality in education, and sometimes even outright discrimination continue to hold back far too many of our fellow Americans.\n\nThat’s why it’s imperative that in striving to redress our country’s stark inequities, we focus on root and branch reform rather than quick fixes.\n\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, that means our approach acknowledges and examines the root causes of employment disparities; targets interventions to disproportionately affected populations; removes barriers to work, training, and education; encourages improved job quality and support for workers; and increases access to career pathways that lead to financial stability. I’m an engineer by trade, and I know the importance of building sturdy foundations.\n\nBuilding a more equitable economy is not just — in my view — an urgent moral task, but an important one for our economy as well. According to my colleagues at the San Francisco Fed, the economic loss owing to racial and gender disparities in our labor market stands at around $2.6 trillion. The bottom line — quite literally — is that we will all benefit from a more inclusive economy.\n\nThat’s why today’s conversation is so important: It is about helping the incredibly talented people in our region connect to opportunities, leverage their skills, and connect with training and job placement programs.\n\nSo, thank you again for joining us today. And now over to you, Keith.",

            "content": "Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to this audience spanning time zones! It’s an honor to be here today at this very important conference. And as a recovering academic, I’m particularly delighted to be here on Day 3, when we will be discussing credentials and higher education. This is a vitally important topic for the health of communities across our country, and I truly thank you for having me.\n\nNow, before we proceed with today’s program, many of you veterans of Fed events will know what’s coming next: that’s right, the standard Fed disclaimer. The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPathways to Success\n\nEducation has long been an engine of economic mobility, and economic mobility is something approaching a national creed of the United States. We believe that anybody — no matter how humble the circumstances in which they were born — should have a pathway to the middle class.\n\nFor me, that pathway was football. I grew up in a blue-collar town next to Camden, NJ. My dad, a union pipefitter, died when I was 9. Much-needed financial aid landed me at Penn where I was a first-generation college student. That was the beginning of a journey that I could never have imagined when I was a boy growing up in South Jersey.\n\nOthers’ pathways are going to look different from mine. And given that 40 years later I’m still carrying around injuries I got playing football at Penn, that’s probably a good thing.\n\nBut unfortunately, far too many Americans born in tough circumstances, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are having a tough time finding their pathway up. It’s incumbent on all of us as Americans to think hard about how we are going to fix what — to my mind — is a profound moral problem: the lack of economic mobility.\n\nSo, what do we do?\n\nSkills More Than Degrees\n\nI’m a career academic and former university president, so this probably sounds like Ronald McDonald admonishing you to lay off saturated fat. But the truth is that many — maybe most — Americans don’t need a traditional four-year college degree. What they need are the skills that will propel them into middle-class jobs. For my dad, my uncles, and my brother, that was pipefitting. And for many, that’s still a great option. For others, it will be something else.\n\nMany skills today are gained through a variety of short-term programs that do not lead to degrees but can provide marketable new skills. These courses can be as short as two months, and students — many of whom are in their midcareer and are looking to retool — gain a marketable new skill. According to a recent Georgetown University study, these can make a meaningful difference in enrollees’ careers: Certificates in engineering technologies can lead to high earnings, as do those in fields like information technology and legal studies. Indeed, the study found some certificates can yield earnings that rival those of bachelor’s degrees in other fields.\n\nThese short-term credentials can be gained in many venues, from traditional community colleges, to private academies like computer coding boot camps both online and brick and mortar, to public‒private partnerships designed to provide pipelines of talent to the private sector. The way the latter works is that companies essentially outsource a portion of their employee training to outside vendors, using a “pay for success” model. That means the company reimburses the entity that paid for the training in the first place — say, the local publicly funded job board — if the new hire hits certain benchmarks, like staying on the job for six months. It can be an effective way to entice corporations to hire from populations they may find too risky or for which they lack sufficient familiarity, particularly those in underserved communities. The workers will benefit, of course, but so will the companies who will have access to an undertapped pool of talent.\n\nAll in all, getting new skills for people strikes me as a situation in which we need to experiment across a wide variety of approaches and methods. We have a lot to learn, and the task couldn’t be more important.\n\nAt the Fed, we’ve also been studying ways to get people into what we call opportunity occupations — jobs that pay the median wage or better and that don’t require a four-year college degree. What’s truly exciting is that our researchers have found that many workers already possess the skills they need to increase their income — all they might need is a little additional training.\n\nMy colleagues in Cleveland and Philadelphia looked at the skill sets of people who are holding at-risk or low-wage jobs. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the average bump in wages was almost $15,000 — real money. On our website, we’ve recently launched what we call an Occupational Mobility Explorer, where workers can plug in their own skills, where they live, and see what’s out there.\n\nThe Four-Year Option\n\nFor others, a four-year degree is still going to be the best option. But far too many students, through no fault of their own, enter demanding institutions without adequate preparation. Many have unfortunately attended high schools that left them ill prepared for college-level work or have had life challenges that have left them unprepared for the demands of a selective college or university. That can be disastrous, because once a student falls behind academically, it’s very, very difficult to catch up.\n\nThat’s why I’d like to talk a little bit about a program at the University of Delaware (UD), where I used to be president. UD’s Associate in Arts Program not only provides a pipeline of students into the university, but also makes sure they are poised to succeed once they get there. I hope our experience in Delaware can provide a useful example for states nationwide.\n\nThe way the associate in arts program works is this: UD courses are taught by UD faculty in small classes in Delaware Tech buildings throughout the state. (Delaware Tech is the state’s public community college.)\n\nStudents receive an associate’s degree in University Studies by earning credits in the core courses that are required of all undergraduates, and then transition to UD’s main campus to earn their bachelor’s degree. Most full-time students receive money from the state to cover their tuition. The program is high touch, with small class sizes and lots of interaction between faculty and students.\n\nI’m thrilled to report that 64 percent of students in the program graduate with their associate’s degree within three years — well above the national average of around 33 percent. Of those, 88 percent go onto the main campus at UD, and nearly 80 percent of those graduate with a bachelor’s degree.\n\nBecause the program is taught by UD faculty, the transition from associate’s to bachelor’s degree becomes something approaching seamless. A member of the English faculty who is teaching in the associate in arts program knows exactly what her students are prepared for once they enter a UD English course, for instance.\n\nIs the associate in arts program going to be replicable in every context across our vast country — particularly when state budgets are under pressure and education funding is under threat? Of course not. But as with certification programs, I’m suggesting we let a thousand flowers bloom. Now is the time to experiment with new models and new pathways to success.\n\nFunding Options\n\nAs with so much else in modern life, a big question surrounding all of this is: How do you pay for it? The traditional student loan has become a millstone around the necks of far too many Americans. Total student loan debt now tops $1.7 trillion, surpassing credit card debt and second only to mortgages. Researchers at the Philadelphia Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve System have studied the ways in which student debt burdens affect subsequent credit outcomes and life events. And all the while, student loan programs are often disproportionately inaccessible to lower-income and minority borrowers due to stringent credit criteria. Besides, many microcredential courses like coding boot camps typically aren’t eligible for federal student loans, meaning many students dig deep into their own pockets or borrow money from family and friends to make necessary investments in their careers.\n\nAnd even among those students who receive student loans and generous financial aid, that sometimes isn’t enough. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve studied the effects of Bridging the Gap, an innovative program at Rutgers University‒Camden that significantly reduces or even eliminates 100 percent of tuition for middle- and low-income students.\n\nWhat we found is that, even though reduced tuition was a huge help, many students still had challenges managing ongoing living and educational expenses beyond tuition. They still needed to work to support their families, for instance, or scrimp and save for books and other educational materials. Another challenge for students is geographic; it can be emotionally and economically difficult for students to leave their hometowns for education — particularly, again, if their family members count on them for financial support.\n\nIncome-based repayment programs offer one potential alternative worth exploring. They are designed so students make payments once their incomes rise above a minimum threshold, and students will never pay more than the cap set at the onset of the agreement. But absent strict oversight, income-based repayment programs could be ripe for abuse, so regulators will need to keep a very close eye on them.\n\nThe bottom line is this: There is an urgent need for education — certificate or degree based — to be more affordable for more people.\n\nThis will take input and action from many segments of society — government, civil society, the corporate sector, and, perhaps especially, from the universities and colleges themselves. The Fed has a role to play, too, with our research and convening power.\n\nTo me, increasing accessibility to education in all its forms is not only an economic imperative but a moral one as well. Indeed, the economic effects of the pandemic are already having a noticeable impact on enrollment among our country’s most disadvantaged.\n\nAccording to the National Student Clearinghouse, enrollment at two-year institutions was down significantly in fall 2020 versus the prior year. First-time enrollment and enrollment for many well-paying vocational programs are even further down. These declines are concentrated among freshmen enrollees — particularly Black, Hispanic, and Native American students. This is a trend we need to do everything in our power to reverse. Once again, too many pathways are being blocked.\n\nWith so much at stake and this being such an important topic, I thank you again for having me today. But before I go, with the recent change in administration in Washington, and the Super Bowl coming up, I can’t resist making one more plug for my old university. Did you know that UD is one of only five schools nationwide to have graduated both a Super Bowl starting quarterback and a U.S. president?\n\nSo, thank you again for having me. Now over to you, Keith.",

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be here ... at least in some form. I’m hopeful that the next time we convene it will be in 3D.\n\nAnd happy new year! After the year we just had ― filled with tremendous loss, pain, and dislocation and disunity in our nation ― I and my colleagues at the Fed recommit our efforts to serve the Third District and the country in order to build a strong and inclusive economy, an economy that works for all Americans.\n\nMy plan for this morning is to share a few thoughts on where the national economy is now and where it’s headed. Given that this is a Philadelphia audience, I’ll then offer some thoughts on the outlook for our region. After that, we’ll open things up for a Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to. I will especially welcome the hard questions, such as “What became of our Eagles this year?”\n\nBut before we proceed, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe State of the Virus\n\nNow, it’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us physically apart today: COVID-19.\n\nWhen you’re looking for a house, a realtor will tell you what the three most important things are: location, location, and location. And when you’re talking to a Fed president, he or she will tell you that the three most important things affecting the economy are: the virus, the virus, the virus.\n\nSo, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus itself — more than anything else — is determining the trajectory of the economy.\n\nIn the space of about a year, the virus has infected more than 85 million people around the world and killed more than 1.8 million. In the U.S., the death toll has now surpassed 350,000. The math is stark: With 4 percent of the world’s population, we’ve suffered 20 percent of the world’s fatalities. Certain communities have borne the brunt of the virus more than others, with racial minorities both becoming infected with the coronavirus and dying at higher rates than White Americans.\n\nWhile the number of infections and deaths fell during the warmer months, cases have been on the rise since September. And deaths, a lagging indicator, are tragically now even more voluminous than they were during the first wave of COVID-19 last spring.\n\nIt’s truly impressive that several pharmaceutical companies were able to develop highly effective vaccines for COVID-19 at warp speed — a real tribute to modern ingenuity. But what matters more than vaccines is vaccinations — that is, getting needles in people’s arms.\n\nThere, our country’s performance has been incredibly disappointing so far. Fewer than 5 million people have received their first dose of the vaccine — less than 2 percent of our total population. In Israel, by contrast, they’ve managed to distribute the first dose to more than 15 percent of the country’s population.\n\nThe State of the National Economy\n\nCOVID-19 has been utterly determinative of the U.S. economy’s performance, both as local governments impose measures to curtail the spread, which depress economic activity, and as consumers change their behavior to protect themselves and their loved ones. The latter is a crucial point that sometimes gets lost.\n\nBut the bottom line is this: If people don’t feel safe, they won’t engage in the broader economy.\n\nAnd so, even before state and local governments took action last spring, many Americans had stopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and boarding public transit. That’s a trend that has continued throughout the pandemic. Many local governments have introduced measures to curtail indoor restaurant dining. But even before that, data that we look at here at the Fed showed that people had begun dining out less.\n\nIt isn’t surprising then that the economy has largely tracked the spread of the virus. In the second quarter of last year, as the U.S. endured its first wave of COVID-19 and as state and local governments implemented various shutdown measures, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in recorded history. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 32 percent; 22 million jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were the hardest hit.\n\nFollowing that contraction, the economy rebounded quite nicely. Stay-at-home orders were lifted, and millions of Americans returned to their jobs. Indeed, a little more than half of those 22 million residents who were suddenly out of work earlier in 2020 are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate down from 14.7 percent in April to 6.7 percent today, which is still far too high, especially because the headline number masks the millions of Americans who have simply dropped out of the labor force. It’s also troubling that the ranks of the long-term unemployed have swelled.\n\nOur country’s economic tribulations, tracking the path of the virus, have wreaked havoc on people’s lives. Since the onset of the pandemic, the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute has conducted several nationwide surveys of consumers about their financial situation.\n\nNot surprisingly, last spring saw a huge surge in Americans facing financial hardship. But then, as cases declined in the warmer months and the economy reopened, things looked up. Between April and July 2020, respondents to the survey reported steady improvements. Increasingly fewer of those responding to the survey reported losing their job, experiencing declines in income, and having trouble making ends meet.\n\nWith the resurgence of the virus, those trends have turned sharply negative once again. While the latest survey found fewer respondents reporting job losses, they did report more income declines and increased concerns about their financial futures.\n\nThe hard times will be with us for a little while longer. On the national level, for now, I’m expecting the fourth quarter of last year to show modest growth, before a significant slowing in the first quarter of this year — possibly even negative growth. In other words, “happy new year” has a caveat.\n\nThe good news is that the weakness should stay relatively short lived — as we all hope COVID-19 vaccinations become more widely available. The recently passed $900 billion of fiscal support — while we can quibble over the details — should also help buoy the economy. I am optimistic that in the second half of 2021, the economy — and frankly, life — should begin to look much more normal. GDP growth should be strong in the second half of the year, and through 2022, before a light tapering in 2023.\n\nThe State of the Local Economy\n\nHere in our area, the situation should look similar to the national picture, with slow to negative growth in the beginning of the year and a much healthier — in all senses of the word — second half of 2021.\n\nOur region, for better or worse, tends to be roughly a middle-of-the-pack player when it comes to economic trends. We don’t boom like some areas, but we don’t bust like them either.\n\nLocal employment figures show that this trend has remained true during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of late last year, in Pennsylvania, year-over-year employment was down 7.8 percent, which is roughly in the middle of the pack among the states. In New York state, for instance, employment was down 11.2 percent, whereas it was down only 4.5 percent in Texas.\n\nBut of course those numbers mask vast gaps across different sectors of the economy within our region.\n\nIn the Philadelphia area, like in the rest of the country, the hardest hit sectors have been leisure and hospitality and education and health services. In leisure and hospitality alone, nearly 100,000 jobs have been lost in the Philadelphia MSA since March. The upshot is that year over year, about 30 percent of total employment in that sector has evaporated — a stunning decline. In education and health services, meanwhile, nearly 30,000 jobs have been eliminated since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nManufacturing, by contrast, has held up relatively well, with employment down less than 5 percent. Output in manufacturing has remained strong as well, with activity at or above pre-pandemic levels. And given that employment has declined slightly in manufacturing and output has not, this means the sector has figured out ways of being more productive during the pandemic.\n\nThe Coming Recovery\n\nI expect that, as we recover, the economic picture will remain uneven, with wildly unequal outcomes across sectors of the economy. There’s a strong chance that consumer habits will have changed long term, even when we’ve finally rid ourselves of COVID-19. That will have significant impacts.\n\nWith the boom in videoconferencing, for instance, business travel could remain depressed indefinitely, placing stress on hotels and restaurants. Americans may have become even more addicted to online shopping, harming the physical retail industry. And higher education — my old industry — faces major threats not only from changes brought on by the pandemic, but also from the country’s demographics. The traditional college-age population has actually begun to decline.\n\nAll of these changes would in turn have knock-on effects to other sectors of the economy, like commercial real estate. And a downturn in commercial real estate would, of course, affect the financial industry ... et cetera, et cetera.\n\nAutomation represents another challenge. Researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have found that many of the jobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return — even after the virus has passed. They will instead be automated. To take an example near and dear to all of our hearts, the Pennsylvania Turnpike has switched permanently to automatic tolling — a change that was initially spurred by the onset of the pandemic and the need to promote social distancing.\n\nToday, I’d like to challenge all of us to think hard about ways to make sure the coming recovery is not only strong, but equitable.\n\nAnd that’s a subject I would be happy to address more during the Q&A, as the Philadelphia Fed is working on a number of important projects. It’s my firm belief that, as we emerge from this tragic period, we can seize many opportunities to build the society we all want.\n\nSo, thank you, and happy new year once again.

            "content": "Good morning! It’s great to be back among so many of “my people.”\n\nYou might say, after all, that I have at least a minor connection to Wharton, and to Penn in general. I went to Penn for undergrad. And I also have a master’s from Penn — two of them actually. And a Ph.D. from Penn. I was a professor at Penn. Oh, and as many of you know, I was also dean of the Wharton School.\n\nI should probably also mention that my wife went to Penn. And so did two of my three children. And Penn doctors recently performed surgery on my foot to rectify an old injury that I sustained … playing football at Penn.\n\nSo, yes, it’s wonderful to be back — in some form — at what feels an awful lot like a second home.\n\nNow, before we proceed, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMy plan for this morning is to share a few thoughts on where the economy is now and where it’s headed. I’ll also offer some observations on how we can build a durable and equitable recovery as we emerge from this period. After that, we’ll open things up for a fireside chat with some Q&A, which I’m really looking forward to. I especially welcome the hard questions, such as what on Earth is going on with Carson Wentz?\n\nThe State of the Virus\n\nIt’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us physically apart today: COVID-19. The three most important things affecting the economy are: the virus, the virus, the virus.\n\nSo, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus itself — more than anything else — is determining the trajectory of the economy.\n\nIn the space of about a year, the virus has infected more than 60 million people around the world and killed more than 1.4 million. In the U.S., the death toll has now surpassed 260,000. The math is stark: With 4 percent of the world’s population, we’ve suffered 20 percent of the world’s fatalities.\n\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than others. Racial minorities have been sickened from the coronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the ensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\n\nWhile the number of infections and deaths fell during the warmer months, cases have been on the uptick since the week ending September 8. Deaths — a lagging indicator — are unfortunately now back to the highs we had not seen since the first wave in the spring. We are clearly in the midst of a second wave that, while not unexpected, is still shocking and heartbreaking in its viciousness.\n\nThe State of the Economy\n\nCOVID-19’s resurgence is bound to have an economic effect, both as local governments introduce measures to curtail the spread and as consumers change their behavior. The latter is a crucial point that sometimes gets lost.\n\nIf people don’t feel safe, they won’t engage in the broader economy. And so, even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had stopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking into hotels. That’s a trend that has continued throughout the pandemic. Some local governments, including Philadelphia, have recently introduced measures to curtail indoor restaurant dining. But even before that, data showed that people had begun dining out less. Some people may have traveled over the Thanksgiving holiday, but TSA data indicated that passenger traffic was still down by more than half of what it was last year. In short, government actions to stop the spread of COVID-19 are somewhat of a lagging indicator as well.\n\nIt isn’t surprising, then, that the economy has largely tracked the spread of the virus. In the second quarter of this year, as the U.S. experienced its first wave of COVID-19 and as state and local governments implemented various shutdown measures, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in recorded history. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 32 percent; 22 million jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were hardest hit.\n\nFollowing that contraction, the economy rebounded quite nicely. Stay-at-home orders were lifted, and millions of Americans returned to their jobs. Indeed, a little more than half of those 22 million residents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate down from 14.7 percent in April to 6.9 percent, which is still disastrously high. The recovery has been uneven, with segments like manufacturing and housing outpacing hospitality and leisure.\n\nFor now, I’m forecasting moderate growth for the rest of this year and the first quarter of 2021 that keeps us below the prepandemic trend. Indeed, we are currently seeing signs of plateauing in the economy. That’s attributable both to COVID-19’s continued circulation and to the evaporation of fiscal support — particularly for low-income households — that the federal government provided at the onset of the pandemic. I recently had a conversation with a major banker who expressed deep concerns about the fast-approaching “fiscal cliff,” as many Americans will soon lose their unemployment benefits and begin to face hardships like eviction and foreclosure. Unemployment claims are already on the uptick.\n\nMy forecast calls for growth to pick up in the second half of 2021 and through 2022 before a light tapering in 2023. But that comes with two important caveats. For one, my forecast is premised on a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 — or perhaps, multiple vaccines — becoming available sometime in the spring or summer of next year. We’ve had very encouraging news on that front in recent weeks. My forecast also expects an additional $1 trillion of fiscal support for the economy. There, the news has been less encouraging recently, which is my way of saying this forecast is very, very uncertain.\n\nThe Fed’s robust actions in dealing with this crisis — cutting rates fast and early and establishing a number of lending facilities — were effective in blunting the contraction. Even when those lending facilities, such as our fund that was set up to aid state and local governments, were not tapped as often as we may have expected at the outset, their mere existence was useful in getting private markets flowing. We witnessed a so-called announcement effect. Markets that were largely frozen thawed when we announced the establishment of those facilities.\n\nIn my opinion, those facilities should stay open past the end of this year. Until we get through this pandemic, the economy needs to be supported. At this point, the fewer changes we make to our lending facilities, the better.\n\nRising Automation\n\nNow before we move to the discussion, I’d like to say a few words about the changes in our society that the virus is spurring.\n\nFundamentally, rather than fully changing things, this pandemic has had the effect of accelerating trends that were already present in our society. Categories like department stores were already struggling — and COVID-19 only served to expedite their demise. Racial minorities like Black Americans were already more likely to be unemployed than other groups, though one of the salutary trends of the prepandemic economy was that this gap was narrowing. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has erased that progress.\n\nSimilarly, trends in labor markets like the increased use of automation are not new. They are simply happening at a more rapid clip since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nFor decades, the U.S. economy has seen increasing automation in industries spanning manufacturing to food service to office work. But the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that those transitions are now occurring at lightning speed.\n\nResearchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been closely studying the effect of the pandemic on labor markets and automation and have made several key — if still rather preliminary — findings. I would like to share some with you.\n\nSome of their findings have been predictable: It turns out that the most automatable jobs are those that do not permit remote work and those that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Obviously, machinery and software are not susceptible to the virus, so they have often become more attractive options than human workers during the pandemic. Think of meatpacking and slaughterhouse jobs, for example, which are increasingly automated.\n\nOr, closer to home, think of the Pennsylvania Turnpike laying off more than 500 workers this spring as it switched to automatic tolling.\n\nOther findings are more surprising and deeply alarming. You might expect that a lot of the jobs that were eliminated because of COVID-19 might come roaring back after the virus passes, for example. But this might not be the case.\n\nFed researchers have found, based on precedent dating to prior recessions, that, in fact, many of the jobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return — even after the virus has passed. They will instead be automated. Those Pennsylvania Turnpike workers were permanently laid off, for instance.\n\nOur researchers have also found that minority workers are more likely than other groups to hold jobs that could be lost — permanently — to automation. And that leads to the alarming conclusion that pandemic-induced automation will — as we have in fact seen — only serve to accentuate preexisting disparities in our society.\n\nWe can’t stop technological progress, of course. But this wave of automation will require each of us to think hard about how we can transition affected workers into new, stable careers filled with opportunity.\n\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we’re working hard on designing programs that can upskill people who are experiencing labor force dislocation, which I’m happy to talk more about during our discussion. It’s my firm belief that we can seize the opportunity as we emerge from this tragic period.\n\nSo, thank you, and now let’s open this up for discussion.",

            "content": "Good afternoon! It’s an honor to be joined by all of you here today. As a Fed president, I’m not sure my star power can match that of some of my fellow panelists. I’ll admit I’m no Deepak Chopra or T. D. Jakes, but I’m also pretty thrilled to rub shoulders with them — even if only virtually.\n\nBut on a serious note, Operation HOPE’s mission of ensuring financial uplift and economic inclusion for all Americans could not be more important — or timelier, given present circumstances — so I am very excited and frankly flattered to be a part of this great series of events this week.\n\nI’m also excited to sketch out a few thoughts on our present circumstances and to chat with John Bryant. But before I can get to that, there is something else I have to do. We call it the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt’s no secret to anyone here that we’re in the middle of twin crises the likes of which none of us has ever experienced. COVID-19 has sickened tens of millions of our fellow Americans and killed hundreds of thousands of them. And the virus, unfortunately, is still circulating widely throughout the country.\n\nThe pandemic also spurred an economic downturn so severe that, in the second quarter of this year, we experienced the sharpest contraction of gross domestic product (or GDP) in recorded American history. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, and millions more had their hours cut.\n\nWe see the scars everywhere — in the miles-long lines at foodbanks that indicate massive suffering and in the shuttered storefronts and restaurants that now dominate so many of our commercial districts that just a few months ago were bustling.\n\nIt’s also no secret that the effects of this unprecedented crisis have fallen most harshly on those least able to bear them. Racial minorities — particularly Hispanic and Black Americans — have been more affected by both the health crisis and the economic crisis than other groups.\n\nHispanics and Black Americans have been sickened by COVID-19 at a rate disproportionate to their population. They have also died at a higher rate. Those same groups also are more likely to hold jobs that one can’t perform from home, which is probably one of the reasons their infection rates are higher than other groups. They are also more likely to have held jobs that have either been replaced by automation or that have simply been eliminated.\n\nThis is a five-alarm fire.\n\nThe one thing I truly admire about Operation HOPE is that it doesn’t just call itself a non-profit organization. It calls itself a for-purpose organization.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also a for-purpose organization. Since the Fed is the nation’s central bank, Congress has mandated us to provide for maximum employment and stable prices — that is, lots of jobs and low inflation.\n\nBut another purpose I believe we can work toward is narrowing the yawning racial disparities that continue to plague our society.\n\nSo, how do we do that?\n\nGiven that I am a Fed president, you probably guessed that I might say monetary policy. And I do think that’s part of the solution. That’s why I’m pleased that, in late August, following a nearly two-year review, the Fed announced a shift in our approach to fulfilling that dual mandate that I mentioned earlier.\n\nHere is the upshot: No longer will we head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates before we have achieved full employment. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation (as we now find ourselves in), we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of slightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals.\n\nThat’s important because one of the salutary trends of the pre-COVID-19 economy was that economic gains, at least on a limited basis, were finally being enjoyed by lower-wage workers, a disproportionate percentage of whom are racial minorities. We still had a very, very long way to go, of course. But it’s clear that we must achieve full employment if we are going to make progress on this issue.\n\nWe also need to do a better job of transitioning workers into careers that offer solid pay and strong future prospects. Here at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been thinking hard about how to get workers into what we call opportunity occupations — that is, jobs that pay the median wage or better and that don’t require a college degree.\n\nI’d like to share the results of just one study we’ve done because I think the results are truly exciting.\n\nThe study began when Philadelphia Fed researchers, in partnership with the Cleveland Fed, asked a question: How do we transition workers in jobs most likely to disappear into stable, higher-wage positions?\n\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of people who are holding those jobs that are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\n\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay differences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in salary.\n\nThe opportunities for public‒private partnerships to initiate these kinds of transitions are obvious, and I’m proud to say that the Philadelphia Fed helped launch one with Comcast and Philadelphia Works, our local workforce development board. That’s just one project, of course, but if it proves to be replicable across cities and industries, I really think we can begin to move the needle.\n\nThere is a division within the Federal Reserve that has defined racial equity as “the just and fair inclusion in an economy in which all can participate, prosper, and reach their full potential, and race can no longer predict life outcomes.” That’s a lofty goal, of course, but a really profound one, I think: the idea that we can one day decouple race from life outcomes. If we get there, I know that Operation HOPE will have played a role.\n\nSo, thanks again for having me, and now I’m happy to chat with John Bryant.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome! I’m thrilled to be with you today, even if we are meeting — fittingly for the topic of today’s webinar — in a rather “artificial” format. We are all hoping that the next time we gather together, it will actually be in person.\n\nNow, we may be meeting in unusual circumstances today, but some things never change. One of those is my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe’re gathered here for what I’m certain will be a fascinating discussion on artificial intelligence — and specifically, the effect that COVID-19 has had on the field.\n\nCOVID-19 and the Economy\n\nBut I think there is an unwritten rule somewhere that every time a Fed president addresses an audience, he or she also must also give an outlook on where the economy is headed. It’s one of the hazards of the job, I suppose.\n\nSo, I’ll begin with that, offering a quick look at where the economy has been, where it is now, and where it might be headed. And after that, I’ll share a few considerations on automation and AI.\n\nIt’s no secret that the economy has been profoundly affected by the same scourge that has kept us physically apart today: COVID-19. So, let’s begin with where we are with COVID-19, given that the virus itself, more than anything else, is determining the trajectory of the economy.\n\nAs you well know, still less than a year after COVID-19 first emerged, the virus has infected more than 30 million people around the world and killed more than 1 million.\n\nOur own country has been particularly hard hit. Because of the United States’ inability to control the virus, we’ve experienced approximately 21 percent of the world’s deaths, despite housing only about 4 percent of the world’s population. Infection rates have come down from the highs we saw in the spring and summer, but the virus is still circulating widely in large swaths of the country. And in recent days, we’ve even seen alarming spikes in other areas, like New York City, that we had hoped had permanently suppressed their infection rates.\n\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than others. Racial minorities, particularly Black Americans and Hispanics, have been sickened from the coronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the ensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\n\nA virus as contagious, deadly, and frankly as mysterious as COVID-19 was bound to have a significant economic impact. Even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had stopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking in to hotels. State and local governments then compounded the economic misery when — and I want to stress that they did so in a responsible attempt to protect public health — they shuttered many businesses deemed nonessential.\n\nThe upshot? In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. experienced its worst quarterly GDP drop in recorded history when the economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 33 percent. Twenty-two million jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were hardest hit.\n\nThe good news is, following that contraction, the economy has rebounded faster than many of us had projected. Stay-at-home orders have been lifted, and though large segments of the economy remain depressed, millions of Americans have returned to their jobs. Indeed, about half of those 22 million residents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate down from 10.2 percent to 7.9 percent, which is still disastrously high.\n\nFor now, I expect this recovery to continue, though not fast enough that, by the end of this year, GDP will have returned to where it was before the pandemic struck. In fact, there have been a few recent signs of plateauing, suggesting that a return to the baseline will take quite some time. Segments like tourism and hospitality will remain subdued for a long time to come, presenting an overall drag on GDP and employment growth. Employment, unfortunately, probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023. Last week’s disappointing jobs report underscored how far we have to go.\n\nI want to caution that this forecast is freighted with uncertainty because, once again, of COVID-19. The scenario of continued growth that I have presented depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new infections — probably a result of nearly universal mask wearing, especially indoors — that ensures only sporadic new outbreaks. We’re also assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to late next year. But COVID-19, as the world has learned all too painfully, is difficult to control. And so, the path of the economy largely depends on the path of the virus.\n\nIt depends in no small part, too, on the path that the federal government chooses to take. My forecasts are assuming an additional $1 trillion of fiscal support, which has yet to materialize.\n\nCOVID-19 and Automation\n\nFundamentally, this pandemic has had the effect of accelerating trends that were already present in our society. Categories like department stores were already struggling — and COVID-19 only served to expedite their obsolescence. Racial minorities like Black Americans were already more likely to be unemployed than other groups — and COVID-19 heightened this yawning disparity.\n\nSimilarly, trends in labor markets like the increased use of automation are not new. They are simply happening at a more rapid clip since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nFor decades, the U.S. economy has seen increasing automation in industries spanning manufacturing to food service to office work. But the COVID-19 pandemic has ensured that those transitions are now occurring at lightning speed.\n\nResearchers here at the Philadelphia Fed have been closely studying the effect of the pandemic on labor markets and automation and have made several key — if still rather preliminary — findings. I would like to share some with you.\n\nSome of their findings have been predictable: It turns out that the most automatable jobs are those that do not permit remote work and those that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission. Obviously, machinery and software are not susceptible to the virus so have often become more attractive options than human workers during the pandemic. Think of meat-packing and slaughterhouse jobs, for example, which are increasingly automated. Or, closer to home, think of the Pennsylvania Turnpike laying off more than 500 workers this spring as it switched to automatic tolling.\n\nOther findings are more surprising and deeply alarming. You might expect that a lot of the jobs that were eliminated because of COVID-19 might come roaring back after the virus passes, for example. But this might not be the case.\n\nFed researchers have found, based on precedent dating to prior recessions, that, in fact, many of the jobs that the pandemic eliminated may never return — even after the virus has passed. They will instead be automated. Those Pennsylvania Turnpike workers were permanently laid off, for instance.\n\nOur researchers have also found that minority workers are more likely than other groups to hold jobs that could be lost, permanently, to automation. And that leads to the alarming conclusion that pandemic-induced automation will, as we have in fact seen, only serve to accentuate preexisting disparities in our society.\n\nWe can’t stop technological progress, of course. But this wave of automation will require each of us to think hard about how we can transition affected workers into new, stable careers filled with opportunity.\n\nCOVID-19 and Algorithms\n\nThe pandemic likewise has had a profound effect on the algorithmic artificial intelligence that is increasingly used to power large segments of our economy. Algorithms are built on precedent, and so it’s little surprise that as COVID-19 caught governments unawares, it also significantly affected their ability to process what was happening. The algorithms — like all of us — had simply never experienced the set of circumstances that COVID-19 presented. And so many algorithms have seen a deterioration in their performance during this period.\n\nTake credit scores. One would assume that in a time when 22 million Americans had lost their jobs and millions more Americans had their hours cut that credit scores would have declined. But in fact, the opposite happened: Credit scores have, in the aggregate, risen during this period.\n\nOne reason for this is that, even in this economic downturn, delinquencies are actually down because the aforementioned CARES Act mandated loan forbearance. That was absolutely the right thing to do but led the currently used algorithms to the counterintuitive conclusion that default probabilities have in fact decreased.\n\nAnother consideration going forward will be to ensure that algorithms do not serve to perpetuate the kinds of discrimination that we have seen historically in our financial sector. Will machine learning perpetuate long-standing inequities in, for instance, the rate at which certain racial groups are turned down for loans?\n\nThis issue will require a conversation spanning academic fields — computer science, law, economics, and others.\n\nAnd it will also require action from not just regulators but probably lawmakers, too, given that many of the laws governing discrimination date back to 1961, when computers couldn’t even fit inside a single room. Conversations like the one we are hosting today hold important implications for the future of our economy — and making sure that we are building an equitable future for all of us.\n\nAnd in the meantime, we can rest assured the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue — though I hope it stops before they figure out a way to replace Fed presidents with robots.\n\nThank you very much.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome! Thank you so much for joining us today for this absolutely crucial series of discussions. And, by the way, it was great to be introduced by my old friend Art and to see him after so long ... well, sort of “see” him.\n\nAs you probably have noticed, we’re meeting under unorthodox circumstances today. But some things never change. One of those is my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOur Unequal Economy\n\nWe’re gathered here today to discuss a topic that simply could not be more urgent: building an equitable workforce recovery.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the U.S. economy was, in many respects, very healthy. Unemployment was low, and GDP growth was humming along steadily. But even then, stresses were mounting, inequality was widening, and racial disparities dating back to the founding of our country persisted. That has been painfully obvious here in Philadelphia, America’s poorest big city and its largest plurality-Black major city.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 crisis, racial minorities — particularly Black Americans — had higher unemployment rates, lower wealth, and poorer health outcomes than White Americans. That was just as true across the country as it was here in Philadelphia.\n\nAnd just as the virus itself attacks those with preexisting conditions most viciously, the economic effect of COVID-19 has been to further accentuate the preexisting conditions that existed in the American economy even before the crisis.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed has been conducting extensive research into the economic effects of the pandemic. The results have been sobering — if depressingly predictable.\n\nOur researchers have found that those who have lost their jobs are disproportionately Black and Latino, disproportionately younger, and less likely to have a college degree than other workers.\n\nAnd even among those who have kept their jobs during this period, those same historically disadvantaged groups are also more likely to work in fields that may put them in harm’s way. Our researchers have also found that workers of color disproportionately hold jobs that one cannot perform from home, for instance.\n\nIt’s often said that our current circumstances are the new normal. I refuse to accept that — a raging pandemic that is displacing millions of workers and killing around 1,000 Americans a day is anything but normal.\n\nBut as we begin to map out what our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is going to look like, I also want to make sure that we don’t simply return to the old normal. We need to keep laser focused on building a better normal — one in which growth is shared more equitably and all Americans have an opportunity to participate fully in the economy.\n\nPathways Forward\n\nSo, how do we do that?\n\nGiven that I am a Fed president, you probably guessed that I might say monetary policy. And I do think that’s part of the solution. That’s why I’m pleased that, in late August, following a nearly two-year review, the Fed announced a shift in our approach to fulfill our dual mandate of providing for maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nNo longer will we head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates before we have achieved full employment. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation (as we now find ourselves in), we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of slightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals. That’s important because one of the salutary trends of the pre-COVID economy was that economic gains, at least on a limited basis, were finally being enjoyed by lower-wage workers, a disproportionate percentage of whom are racial minorities. We still had a very, very long way to go, of course. But it’s clear that we must achieve full employment to have any hope of beginning to narrow the yawning gaps that bedevil our society.\n\nAt the local level, we also need to do a better job of transitioning workers into careers that offer solid pay and strong future prospects. Here at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been thinking hard about how to get workers into what we call opportunity occupations — that is, jobs that pay the median wage or better, and that don’t require a college degree.\n\nI’d like to share the results of just one study we’ve done because I think the results are truly exciting.\n\nThe study began when Philadelphia Fed researchers, in partnership with the Cleveland Fed, asked a question: How do we transition workers now in jobs into stable, higher-wage positions?\n\nThey came up with an ingenious idea: They looked at the skill sets of people who are holding those jobs and are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\n\nThe findings were incredibly encouraging. Looking at 33 metro areas nationwide, they found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. For transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study, the pay differences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in salary.\n\nThe opportunities for public‒private partnerships to initiate these kinds of transitions are obvious, and I’m proud to say that the Philadelphia Fed helped launch one with Comcast and Philadelphia Works, which you will hear more about later today.\n\nThe workers themselves will benefit from these transitions, of course, but so will the employers, who will have access to a vast, untapped pool of human capital. All too often, incredible talent is being overlooked because employers are hiring for credentials, like a four-year college degree, over skills. And yes, I realize there is irony in a former college president saying this.\n\nThere are, of course, myriad other barriers to break down. Structural impediments like a lack of access to childcare — another problem only heightened by the pandemic — or an inability to access broadband Internet stand in the way of far too many of our fellow Americans reaching their full economic potential. We need to think hard about how to tear down those walls.\n\nThere are also large segments of our economy that are starved for capital. Minority-owned small businesses, for instance, received far fewer emergency loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, initiated at the start of the crisis, than White-owned small businesses. This happened in many cases because those minority-owned enterprises lacked relationships with banks. We need to think hard about ways to break down those barriers as well.\n\nBuilding an equitable workforce recovery is not just — in my view — a moral necessity, but an economic one as well. The International Monetary Fund has found that when an additional 1 percent of income goes to the top 20 percent of income earners, GDP falls. But when the same gains are made by the bottom 20 percent, GDP rises.\n\nThat makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners save. That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s total GDP. And so, the basic idea is this: Get money into the hands of people most likely to spend it, and you’ll see a multiplier effect throughout the broader economy. And that’s why ensuring an equitable recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is critical in making sure the next expansion is not only fair — but also strong and durable.\n\nToday, we are excited to officially launch our Equitable Workforce Recovery strategy. As many of you know, three years ago, the Philadelphia Fed launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project to create pathways to opportunity across the Third District. Our goal? Leverage our partnerships throughout the District to bring research into action. Now, as we look to the country’s coming economic recovery, we intend to double down on our work to create equitable growth that benefits all.\n\nOver the course of the next year, we will be focusing on the issues I outlined here: investing in small businesses, creating upward mobility for workers, and addressing structural barriers like the digital divide and access to childcare. We are looking forward to continued partnerships across the District through our Research in Action Labs and conversations like the ones we are having today.\n\nOur recent research on automation has emphasized the importance of this moment to invest in workers. Many jobs will not be coming back, and preparing workers for the jobs of the future is critical to our economic health and recovery. This is why I am excited about the panel that you will hear from next, which could not be timelier. The topic of this discussion will be Building the Jobs of the Future, and we are delighted to be joined by the moderator of this discussion, Uva Coles.\n\nUva is an expert on issues of workforce diversity and inclusion. She is the founder, president, and CEO of Inclusiva, LLC, a boutique consulting firm specializing in the development of inclusive workforce strategies. Uva was formerly the assistant vice president of civic and global engagement at Widener University in Chester, PA. We will also hear from business leaders on how they are tackling issues of equity and opportunity in their respective workplaces.\n\nSo, without further ado, please welcome Uva Coles and the rest of our esteemed panelists.

            "content": "Good morning from the East Coast of the United States. I know we’re joined by an international audience today, so good ... well, whatever time it happens to be wherever you are. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I’m sincerely thrilled to welcome you all to this virtual conference.\n\nThe original plan was for me to greet you in person in our Bank in Philadelphia — instead I’m in the more cramped confines of my home office here in New Jersey. We’re still planning on having a full-scale conference in Philadelphia with our partners from the OMFIF around this time next year, which we’re all looking forward to. So, stay tuned for details on that.\n\nNow, even though we’re meeting in strange circumstances today, many of the same old rules apply. Here is one of them: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWe’ve gathered today to hear a distinguished panel provide what I’m sure will be a fascinating discussion on developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But before we get to that, I want to set the table by giving you a brief overview of where the economy has been and where it might be heading, recent actions by the Federal Reserve, and a few of my own considerations on machine learning.\n\nThe State of the Virus\n\nAll of these topics, of course, have been deeply affected by the same scourge that has kept us physically apart today: COVID-19.\n\nSo let’s begin, then, with where we are with the virus. As you well know, still less than a year after COVID-19 first emerged, the virus has infected more than 30 million people around the world and killed nearly 1 million.\n\nThe United States has been particularly hard hit. Because of our country’s unique inability to control the virus, we’ve suffered approximately 21 percent of the world’s deaths, despite housing only about 4 percent of the world’s population. Infection rates have come down from the highs we saw in the spring and summer, but the virus is still circulating widely in large swaths of the country.\n\nAnd even within this disproportionately hard-hit country, certain communities have suffered more than others. Racial minorities, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, have been sickened from the coronavirus at a far higher rate than other groups. They have also died at a higher rate. And in the ensuing economic contraction, they have lost their jobs at a higher rate.\n\nThe State of the Economy\n\nA virus as contagious, deadly, and frankly as mysterious as COVID-19 was bound to have a significant economic impact. Even before state and local governments took action this spring, many Americans had stopped dining out, getting on airplanes, and checking in to hotels. State and local governments then compounded the economic misery when — and I want to stress, in a responsible attempt to protect public health — they shuttered many businesses deemed nonessential.\n\nThe upshot? In the second quarter of this year, the U.S. suffered its worst quarterly GDP drop in recorded history when the economy contracted at an annualized rate of nearly 33 percent. Twenty-two million jobs evaporated. Those with low-wage jobs, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, were hardest hit.\n\nThe good news is, following that contraction, the economy has rebounded faster than many of us had projected. Stay-at-home orders have been lifted, and though large segments of the economy remain depressed, millions of Americans have returned to their jobs. Indeed, about half of those 22 million residents who were suddenly out of work earlier this year are now back, enough to nudge the unemployment rate down from 10.2 percent to a still-catastrophic 8.4 percent.\n\nFor now, I expect this recovery to continue, though not fast enough that, by the end of this year, GDP will have returned to where it was before the pandemic struck. That will take more time. And segments like tourism and hospitality will remain subdued for a long time to come, presenting an overall drag on GDP and employment growth. Employment, unfortunately, probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.\n\nI want to caution that this forecast is freighted with uncertainty because, once again, of COVID-19. The scenario of continued growth that I have presented depends on a sustained decline in the rate of new infections — probably a result of nearly universal mask-wearing, especially indoors — that ensures only sporadic new outbreaks. We’re also assuming that a vaccine becomes widely available sometime mid to late next year. But COVID-19, as the world has learned all too painfully, is difficult to control. And so the path of the economy largely depends on the path of the virus.\n\nIt depends in no small part, too, on the path that the federal government chooses to take. When COVID-19 first struck, it brought forth a policy response that, in my view, was commensurate to its gravity. Early on, Congress provided significant fiscal support for the economy through the CARES Act. That blunted the pain of the contraction. Unfortunately, that relief has now expired, and I would urge lawmakers to consider providing additional support soon.\n\nThe Role of the Fed\n\nFor our part, the Federal Reserve’s role in responding to the crisis has been robust. But our main power is lending. We cannot simply spend money or issue grants. That is Congress’s role.\n\nThe Fed’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use those lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity. Moreover, our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to disintermediate the private sector — we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\n\nSo, what have we done?\n\nFirst and foremost, we lowered our policy interest rate to near zero fast and early. We kept this stance unchanged at this month’s FOMC meeting and indicated that we plan to keep those rates very low for a very long time.\n\nIn August, we also announced a long-considered change to how we will balance inflation and employment going forward. Following a nearly two-year review, the Fed announced we will no longer head off higher inflation by preemptively raising interest rates. Moreover, after long periods of sub-2 percent inflation — as we now find ourselves in — we will accept periods of above-2 percent inflation. Tolerating the risk of slightly higher inflation, in our view, is worth it if it helps us achieve our employment goals.\n\nUsing the discount window, we are also actively encouraging banks to borrow money from the Fed at ultralow interest rates, to make sure they have the funds they need to serve their customers at this critical time.\n\nIn order to keep markets functioning, beginning in March, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. As a backstop, we have also purchased some corporate debt, and as the economy and credit markets heal, we will disengage from that market as prudently and as expeditiously as possible.\n\nBacked by credit protection from the U.S. Treasury, we’ve also launched the Main Street Lending Program, which provides support for small and midsize businesses that were in good financial standing before the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was recently expanded to include nonprofit organizations, such as universities and nonprofit medical institutions, which tend to be very important anchor institutions in their communities.\n\nThere has been somewhat limited interest in Main Street — only about 400 banks have registered to participate in this program. But in a way, that’s actually a good sign for the economy because it means that firms have access to capital without having to use the Fed. Because if you recall, in all of this, we are simply a backstop. On the other hand, if there is another major downturn in the economy, these facilities will still be in place to offer funding.\n\nWe’re also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses that are receiving aid through the program.\n\nPPP is now closed to new applications. But when it was open, it drew a lot of interest. More than 5 million loans were issued to the tune of more than $520 billion. Under our program, the Fed provided liquidity to institutions issuing about 17 percent of those loans. This is another positive sign for the economy and the financial sector, as it shows the vast majority of banks have sufficient liquidity to extend credit.\n\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity Facility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is designed to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the economic downturn. The State of Illinois has already tapped this, and we are also opening it to multistate agencies like the Port Authority of New York and other transit authorities. While so far only the State of Illinois has tapped this facility, the Fed by merely announcing its existence did a lot of work in getting private markets functioning again.\n\nMachine Learning\n\nCOVID-19 has affected everything from health care to tax receipts to tourism. And so, of course, it has also had an impact on the subject of today’s panel discussion: artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nAlgorithms are built on precedent, and so it’s little surprise that as COVID-19 caught governments unawares, it also significantly affected the artificial intelligence that is increasingly used to power large segments of our economy. The algorithms — like all of us — had simply never experienced the set of circumstances that COVID-19 presented. And so many algorithms have seen a deterioration in their performance during this period.\n\nTake credit scores. One would assume that in a time when 22 million Americans had lost their jobs and millions more Americans had their hours cut that credit scores would have declined. But in fact, the opposite happened: Credit scores have, in the aggregate, risen during this period.\n\nOne reason for this is that even in this economic downturn, delinquencies are actually down because the aforementioned CARES Act mandated loan forbearance. That was absolutely the right thing to do but led the currently used algorithms to the counterintuitive conclusion that default probabilities have in fact decreased.\n\nAnother consideration going forward will be to ensure that algorithms do not serve to perpetuate the kinds of discrimination that we have seen historically in our financial sector. Will machine learning perpetuate long-standing inequities in, for instance, the rate at which certain racial groups are turned down for loans?\n\nThis issue will require a conversation spanning academic fields — computer science, law, economics, and others. And it will also require action from not just regulators but probably lawmakers, too, given that many of the laws governing discrimination date back to 1961, when computers couldn’t even fit inside a single room. Conversations like the one we are hosting today hold important implications for the future of our economy — and making sure that we are building an equitable future for all of us.\n\nAnd in the meantime, we can be rest assured the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning will continue — though I hope it stops before they figure out a way to replace Fed presidents with robots.\n\nThank you very much.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks to Suzette for that very kind introduction. It’s great to be here among such an impressive group of people who care deeply about our city.\n\nGiven that today’s lunch is virtual, I won’t do the standard thing and urge you to try the salmon and tip the waiters. But I still have to do another standard thing, which is to give you my usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe New Abnormal\n\nWe’re now about four months into the coronavirus crisis and the onset of what I don’t want to call the “new normal.” None of this — including the fact that we’re meeting virtually today — is normal.\n\nOver that period, we went from enjoying strong economic growth, stable prices, and near-record low unemployment to a sharp contraction of economic activity and tens of millions of job losses. Meanwhile, more than 130,000 of our fellow citizens across the country have lost their lives to COVID-19 — and the number continues to rise each day.\n\nIt has been a heartbreaking period.\n\nI was trained as an engineer right here in Philadelphia, and one of my guiding principles has always been to trust the science. We’re learning that lesson anew during this period. Despite the enormous sacrifices made by tens of millions of Americans, the country has still failed to control the virus.\n\nThat is first and foremost a public health crisis. And it’s an economic one, too. A Fed president might like to think otherwise, but there is only so much policymakers can do right now to affect the economy. Our country’s economic performance in a large part depends on what happens with COVID-19.\n\nThe projections I’m about to share with you, in other words, come with a huge caveat: They’re constantly changing along with the path of the virus. Still, doing a bit of averaging, I can tell you that forecasts are suggesting about a negative 20 percent real GDP growth in the first half of this year followed by a 13 percent growth in the second half. Growth in 2020 would end up at around minus 6 percent. That’s a much sharper recession than we experienced during the financial crisis.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that policymakers sit on their hands until the virus passes, of course. Indeed, the pandemic has brought forth a policy response commensurate to its gravity. Congress provided significant fiscal support for the economy, which has blunted the pain of the contraction.\n\nFed Actions\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use our lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity. Our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to disintermediate the private sector — we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\n\nWe’ve done this, first and foremost, by lowering our policy interest rate to near zero fast and early. We kept this stance unchanged at last month’s FOMC meeting. As shown by the Survey of Economic Projections, almost all my colleagues believe, as do I, that it will be appropriate to maintain the policy rate near zero if the economy evolves as expected. Using the discount window, we are also actively encouraging banks to borrow money from the Fed at ultra-low interest rates, to make sure they have the funds they need to serve their customers at this critical time.\n\nIn order to keep markets functioning, beginning in March, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. But we’re not stopping. We intend to keep buying about $120 billion worth of Treasury bonds and MBS each month. As a backstop, we have also purchased some corporate debt, and as the economy and credit markets heal, we will disengage from that market as prudently and as expeditiously as possible.\n\nBacked by credit protection from the U.S. Treasury, we’ve also launched the Main Street Lending Program, which provides support for small and mid-sized businesses that were in good financial standing before the COVID-19 pandemic. The program opened in June and offers a variety of five-year loans to U.S companies employing up to 15,000 workers or with revenues of up to $5 billion, while deferring principal payments for two years and interest payments for one year. In conjunction with the Treasury, we are also considering ways to broaden the program to include nonprofit organizations, which play a vital role in our communities and local economies.\n\nThere has been somewhat limited interest in Main Street — only about 400 banks have registered to participate in this program. But in a way, that’s actually a good sign for the economy because it means that firms have access to capital without having to use the Fed. Because if you recall, in all of this, we are simply a backstop. On the other hand, if there is another major downturn in the economy, these facilities will still be in place to offer funding.\n\nAt the same time, we’re bolstering the heavily used Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses that are receiving aid through the program. There has been a lot interest in PPP, with more than 4.5 million loans issued to the tune of more than $520 billion.\n\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity Facility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is designed to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the economic downturn. The State of Illinois has already tapped this, and we are also opening it to multistate agencies like the Port Authority of New York and other transit authorities.\n\nAn Inclusive Recovery\n\nWe will recover from this period, and there are already small signs that a rebound is underway. But it will take time. And as the recovery takes shape, I want to make sure that the coming growth is not only strong, but inclusive. It’s worth noting that even though we went into the COVID-19 crisis with a very strong economy, far too many Americans — disproportionately Americans of color — were not sharing in the country’s prosperity.\n\nPersonally, I’m serving on the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce’s Regional Recharge and Recovery Task Force. Our goal there is to make sure that the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis is not only stronger in terms of growth, but also that it includes more of our fellow citizens.\n\nThe next period of growth should be strong and more inclusive than the last.\n\nSo, how do we do ensure that? Our work could include doing things like improving access to credit for small businesses and especially microenterprises. I don’t need to tell you that small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities. In the City of Philadelphia, fully 99.5 percent of businesses have fewer than 500 workers. And of those, 54 percent employ fewer than five workers — these are microenterprises.\n\nMany of these microenterprises don’t have the benefit of established banking relationships — many have never banked at all. That leaves them at a huge disadvantage, as we saw when many were unable to obtain PPP loans. And this is a problem that has disproportionately affected racial minorities and communities of color.\n\nTo be sure, there are many historical and structural reasons why so many of our microenterprises remain unbanked. But that doesn’t mean this is a status quo we have to accept. As we work toward recovery, we should be thinking about how to tear down the impediments to those microenterprises having access to the banking system.\n\nCreating economic and professional mobility is also going to be key in making sure all segments of the country benefit from the recovery that is coming. Last month, the Philadelphia Fed released a paper that provides an encouraging roadmap for how that might take place, and I’d like to share some of our findings with you.\n\nFed researchers looked at the skill sets of people in 33 metro areas across the country, including the Philadelphia area, who are holding those jobs that are most at risk of disappearing. They then matched those skills to jobs that would pay at least 10 percent more than their current wage and that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\n\nThe bottom line is this: We don’t have to accept that those in at-risk, low-wage jobs will remain so forever. Researchers found that nearly half of lower-wage employment can be paired with at least one higher-paying occupation requiring similar skills. And the pay differences are significant, with an average bump in wages of almost $15,000 — a 49 percent increase in salary — for transitions connecting the most similar occupations identified in the study. Transitioning people into the right new job can mean the difference between a life of poverty and a solid, middle-class standard of living.\n\nThe possibilities for creative public–private partnerships are very exciting. Transitioning low-wage workers into higher-paying jobs not only helps companies themselves, insofar as they are tapping underutilized human capital, but it also helps redress structural inequities. Communities of color stand to benefit because they have for far too long and far too often been shut out of higher wage work.\n\nAt the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve helped launch just such a program, working in partnership with Comcast and Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board. Philadelphia Works provides upfront investment in a pilot job-training program for Comcast. Comcast then pays for outcomes once they are achieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. It’s a tremendous example of what thoughtful public–private partnerships can accomplish. We can’t push this all on the public sector, which, especially now, doesn’t have the bandwidth or the money. But intelligent public–private partnerships could be a very promising way forward.\n\nRather than staying stuck in this new normal or moving back to the old normal, I am confident that together we can forge a better future — a better normal, perhaps — for all of us. Thank you.\n\nAnd now, I’m happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "Hello, everybody, and thank you to Matuschka for that introduction. This is a very important discussion, and I’m thrilled to be joined by so many of you.\n\nBut before we begin that very important discussion, I need to give you my standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nSmall Businesses in the Economy and Our Communities\n\nIn one sense, it’s gratifying that there is so much interest in the Fed’s COVID-19 Community Impact Survey and the economic effects of the virus more generally.\n\nBut the strong turnout today is also evidence that months after the coronavirus arrived on our shores and shut down vast swaths of the economy, we remain mired in a crisis the likes of which none of us has ever experienced.\n\nIndeed, even as the economy is reopening in fits and starts, the pandemic’s effects are proving not to be just a brief setback. We are in a downturn that is both exceptionally painful and stubbornly long-lasting.\n\nAmong those most affected by this crisis have been those small businesses across the country that are the lifeblood of our economy — and of so many of our own communities.\n\nSmall businesses define the landscape of our cities and towns. Small business owners and their employees are our neighbors, our friends, and oftentimes our family members. They’re our plumbers, our grocers, and our barbers. (Though during the COVID-19 shutdown, some of us have become amateur barbers ourselves.)\n\nSmall businesses also define our economic landscape. The United States certainly boasts more than its fair share of corporate titans — American companies make up for more than a fifth of the Fortune Global 500 — but small businesses are integral to our economy and to the functioning of the labor force.\n\nAccording to the Small Business Administration, as of 2018, there were more than 30 million American small businesses, employing nearly 60 million people. That means that nearly half of the country’s private workforce is employed by small businesses. Small businesses are also an engine for building a more racially equitable economy: More than 8 million small businesses are owned by racial minorities.\n\nAmong small businesses, microenterprises — those employing fewer than five people — predominate. Nationally, some 59 percent of businesses are microenterprises. Here in the Third District, we are particularly sensitive to the concerns of these vital businesses.\n\nIn the City of Philadelphia, fully 99.5 percent of businesses are small businesses, meaning they employ fewer than 500 people. And of those, 54 percent employ fewer than five.\n\nSmall Business and the Pandemic\n\nWhen the COVID-19 crisis hit, the economy was in quite good shape. But even then, many of our small businesses, especially those helmed by racial and ethnic minorities, faced a precarious existence.\n\nAccording to Fed research, at the end of 2019, smaller firms, younger firms, and firms owned by Blacks or Latinos were more likely to be classified as “at risk” or “distressed” than other businesses.\n\nAnd even those firms deemed financially healthy were often on a knife’s edge. Late last year, the Fed found that only 1 in 5 healthy small businesses — and of course, far fewer less-healthy firms — had sufficient cash reserves to continue normal operations if they experienced a two-month revenue loss. A majority of small businesses of any level of health would be likely to reduce their workforce and operations, or delay payments, we found. Many firms would rely on personal funds or debt to bridge the gap.\n\nAnd some said they would try to sell or close their businesses altogether.\n\nSo while it’s tragic news, it ultimately isn’t surprising that small businesses owned by minorities have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nWhen we think about the challenges these businesses have historically faced as a result of the racial wealth gap, it becomes more understandable why minority-owned businesses are in the most precarious financial situations. Just recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the number of Black-owned small businesses nationwide has collapsed by a stunning 41 percent since the onset of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nAnd at the Philadelphia Fed, our research has found that the disproportionate impact does not just fall on minorities who own small businesses, but among those who work for them as well.\n\nThose who have lost jobs within small businesses because of the COVID-19 pandemic have been disproportionately young, disproportionately less educated, and are more likely to be a member of a racial or ethnic minority. Compounding the tragedy is the fact that racial minorities have also been disproportionately affected by the disease itself, with Blacks and Latinos in particular suffering from higher death rates than other groups.\n\nSmall Business and Banking\n\nBack in March, Congress passed the CARES Act, which included the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. PPP was designed so that small businesses could obtain largely forgivable loans if they kept workers on their payroll through the crisis.\n\nThere is no doubt that PPP was an immense help to millions of businesses and that the employment crisis would be far worse without it. PPP has proven to be something of a blunt instrument, however. Fed researchers have found, for instance, no direct correlation between the disbursement of PPP loans and the level of infection in a given area. The State of Nebraska, for example, which has been left relatively unscathed by the coronavirus, has a far higher rate of small businesses receiving PPP loans than those in hard-hit New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\n\nI think a big part of the problem is that the distribution of PPP loans was predicated on having existing banking relationships. Basically, small businesses went to the bank they had borrowed from before in order to get a PPP loan.\n\nThe trouble is that many small businesses, especially those microenterprises we’ve been talking about, don’t have those established banking relationships — many have never banked at all. And so, when PPP loans became available, these business owners had no ability to access them. This is a problem that has disproportionately affected racial minorities and communities of color.\n\nThere are many historical and structural reasons why so many of our microenterprises remain unbanked. But that doesn’t mean that this is a status quo we have to accept. This is why we launched a series on equity in recovery: identifying those who are most at risk and putting them at the center of our work.\n\nAcross the System, something we should all be thinking about is this: How do we solve this problem? What are the existing impediments to those microenterprises having access to the banking system? How can we harness our country’s CDFIs, large banks and community banks, and even microloan financiers and other financial institutions to serve our under-resourced communities and entrepreneurs?\n\nThis isn’t just a problem to be diagnosed — it’s one to work together to solve.\n\nI’ve said many times that I refuse to call this current period of crisis “the new normal.” None of this is normal. But that doesn’t mean that when the COVID-19 pandemic passes that we are destined to go back to the old normal. Together, we can chart our way to a “better normal” — and discussions like these are going to be a part of that important task.\n\nThank you, again, and now I’m happy to take some questions.",

            "content": "Good morning and thanks so much for that introduction, Andrea. It’s great to be back among friends and fellow chamber members … at least in some form.\n\nWe may be meeting in unusual circumstances today, but I still need to give you the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe New Abnormal\n\nIt’s now been more than three months since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis and the beginning of what I don’t want to call the “new normal.” None of this — including the fact that we are meeting today virtually — is normal.\n\nOver that period, we went from enjoying strong economic growth, stable prices, and near-record low unemployment to a sharp contraction of economic activity and tens of millions of job losses. Here in the region that the chamber covers, the unemployment rate shot from 5 percent to more than 15 percent. Meanwhile, more than 115,000 of our fellow citizens across the country have lost their lives to COVID-19 — and the number continues to rise each day.\n\nIt has been a heartbreaking period.\n\nGus Faucher will give you a more granular look at the local economy in a moment, but on the national level, I can tell you I expect 2020 to show a sharp recession; 2021 will be a growth year, with GDP and employment picking up, though not enough to return the economy to where it was at the beginning of this year. All of this, of course, is quite uncertain, depending in a large part on how the virus continues to move through our society.\n\nFed Actions\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s role in mitigating this crisis has been to use our lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity. Our lending facilities are meant as backstops to the private sector. We don’t want to disintermediate the private sector — we simply want to be there to support market functioning.\n\nSo, what have we done?\n\nFirst and foremost, we have lowered our policy interest rate to near zero, a stance we decided to keep unchanged at last week’s FOMC meeting. We intend to keep the rate near zero for the foreseeable future, possibly through 2022.\n\nIn order to keep credit flowing, beginning in March, we began buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. We have now purchased more than $2 trillion of these products. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve slowed the rate of purchases. But we’re not stopping. We intend to keep buying about $120 billion worth of Treasury bonds and MBS each month.\n\nWe’ve also rolled out a program to help cash-strapped local governments. The Municipal Liquidity Facility, whereby we buy bonds from municipalities and states whose tax revenues have collapsed, is designed to provide essential liquidity as they navigate the twin crises of the pandemic and the economic downturn. Earlier this month, we had our first taker, with the State of Illinois tapping the program for $1.2 billion.\n\nWe’ve also been working hard on launching our Main Street Lending Program, which is designed to get cash into the hands of small- to medium-sized businesses whose operations have been hampered by COVID-19 and the shutdowns. Since announcing the facility, we’ve heard a lot of feedback from businesses across the country, and we’ve recently adjusted the program so organizations can take smaller loans — even as small as $250,000 — and take a little longer to pay them back. We intend to launch this program in the coming days. We view it as vitally important in providing a backstop to those small- and medium-sized businesses that are — I don’t need to tell you — the lifeblood of the U.S. economy.\n\nFor the same reason, we have also bolstered the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those businesses that are receiving aid through the program.\n\nAmerican Unrest\n\nNow, I want to switch gears a bit and address something that I’m sure has been on all of your minds.\n\nIn recent weeks, millions of Americans have raised their voices to demand social justice and racial equality. The protests may have begun as a result of the horrifying death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but they quickly evolved into a broader demand for our country to finally rid itself of the scourge of racism and inequality. The Federal Reserve takes those demands seriously, and we are fully committed to building a culture of inclusion throughout our System.\n\nAt the Philadelphia Fed specifically, based as it is in the poorest big city in America, we’ve placed a particular focus on equity and opportunity. Our Community Development and Regional Outreach Department operates the Economic Growth & Mobility Project. This is a multilevel effort to bring entrepreneurial solutions to achieve inclusive economic growth and to create pathways out of poverty through the pillars of creating job opportunities, improving human capital, and addressing housing and other infrastructure needs.\n\nOur Bank’s focus on workforce development is particularly relevant at this moment, given that some of the jobs that have been lost because of the COVID-19 crisis may never return. Others, even when they do come back, will do so in a radically different form, thanks to the rapid technological shifts in the workplace that the pandemic is only accelerating. Our research has shown that those most at risk for COVID-19‒related job loss tend to be disproportionately young, low income, and from a racial minority.\n\nCreating economic and professional mobility is going to be key in making sure all segments of the country benefit from the recovery that is eventually coming. And I’m happy to announce that just today the Philadelphia Fed is releasing a new paper that provides an encouraging roadmap for how that might take place. You can read it on our website.\n\nFed economists looked at the skill sets of people in 33 metro areas across the country, including the Philadelphia area, who are holding those jobs that are most at risk of disappearing.

            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you very much to Daniel for that introduction and a big thank you to everybody at both the Philadelphia and St. Louis Federal Reserve Banks who worked tirelessly to make this virtual event possible. We usually hold these biennial Reinventing Our Communities conferences in Philadelphia, though two years ago we met in Baltimore for the first time. Back then, we thought that was a big change! Little did we know …\n\nNow, we may be meeting in a very different format this year, but I still have to begin by mentioning my usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has certainly changed America in the course of just a few months. Many of us have become expert “social distancers” and furious handwashers. Some of us have even become amateur barbers.\n\nBut in other important ways, this health crisis has not so much changed things as simply exposed, and in some cases accelerated, trends that were already present in our society.\n\nThe United States went into this crisis a troublingly unequal place, beset by serious inequities in income, wealth, and opportunity.\n\nPerhaps most disturbing is that the multiyear economic expansion we experienced through much of the last decade did nothing to reduce American inequality. Indeed, last year, even as by many measures, the economy was in great shape, the Census Bureau calculated that income inequality in 2018 was the highest it had been in the 50 years it has measured it. The Gini coefficient — which measures the equality of income distribution — shows that incomes in the U.S. are far less equally distributed than in other industrialized countries like Germany and Japan.\n\nWealth inequality is even starker.\n\nMy colleagues at the St. Louis Fed calculated last year that, as of 2016, the top 10 percent of wealthiest American households owned 77 percent of the country’s total wealth. The bottom 50 percent owned only 1 percent. Fully 10 percent of American households had negative net worth, meaning their total household debt outstripped their assets.\n\nInequality and poverty touch all corners of America, from depopulating rural communities in the Great Plains, to postindustrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest, to neighborhoods in even some of our wealthiest cities like San Francisco and New York. But we can’t deny that certain communities have borne the brunt of these inequities more than others. It’s simply a fact that some of the underlying inequalities in our society deal with race. To cite just one example, as of 2016, the average family wealth of white families was nearly seven times greater than that of black families.\n\nThe health crisis has only heightened these inequities. For one, the coronavirus itself is affecting some communities more than others. In Philadelphia, more than half of those who have died from COVID-19 have been African American, despite African Americans making up only about 40 percent of the city’s population. This is a trend that has been observable nationwide.\n\nAnd the economic costs of the health crisis have fallen on those least able to bear them as well.\n\nOur researchers at the Philadelphia Fed have been studying closely which neighborhoods and households have been most affected by the economic shutdown. They’ve found that those most likely to be at risk of losing employment were already disproportionately low income.\n\nIn other words, both as a health and an economic crisis, COVID-19 has the cruel effect of hurting those who were already most vulnerable.\n\nAmerican inequality is a moral and ethical challenge to our country’s founding creed. But research shows it’s also a growing economic problem. The International Monetary Fund has found that when an additional 1 percent of income goes to the top 20 percent of income earners, GDP falls. But when the same gains are made by the bottom 20 percent, GDP rises.\n\nThat makes sense, of course: Those who earn less money are likely to spend it, whereas high earners save. That’s crucial because consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s total GDP. Ensuring an equitable recovery from COVID-19 is critical in making sure the next expansion is not only fair but also strong and durable.\n\nThat’s why today’s discussion is so vitally important. Our role at the Fed is not to dictate fiscal policy but to use our academic and applied research, our outreach, and our convening powers to help policymakers all across the country better understand how to deal with these challenges.\n\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project, a multilevel effort to bring entrepreneurial solutions to achieve inclusive economic growth and create pathways out of poverty through the pillars of creating job opportunities, improving human capital, and addressing housing and infrastructure needs.\n\nAs this crisis continues, we must redouble our efforts to redress some of the great underlying challenges to our society. Thank you very much for being a part of this extremely important conversation.",

            "content": "Good morning. As you probably know, I used to be the president of the University of Delaware, so it’s great to be back! At least virtually …\n\nBefore we begin, let me dispense with the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt’s no secret that we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis like none of us have experienced in our lifetimes. The coronavirus that arrived on our shores just a few months ago has already killed tens of thousands of Americans, ended a years-long streak of solid economic growth, and caused tens of millions of our fellow citizens to lose their jobs.\n\nIt’s amazing to think how different my remarks would have been had I given them just two months ago.\n\nThe coronavirus is above all a public health crisis and the Federal Reserve as an institution — and me personally — can’t say enough to adequately convey our gratitude toward America’s health-care workers, as well as other frontline workers like police, grocery-store workers, truck drivers, and innumerable others who are risking their own health for the well-being of the country.\n\nQuantifying the Downturn Nationally and in Delaware\n\nThe economic ramifications of this crisis, of course, have been stark as well.\n\nPerhaps most notable has been a collapse in most forms of consumer spending, a component of GDP that accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s economic activity.\n\nIn March, we experienced a literally unprecedented 7.5 percent fall in consumer spending, and April data will surely be even worse. In the same month, manufacturing output fell to levels not seen since 2011. And data from the Institute for Supply Management showed a stark contraction for April as well.\n\nFalling spending and output are reflected in the national unemployment rate, which now stands at 14.7 percent. Delaware has suffered along with the rest of the country. Between March 21 and May 2, nearly 100,000 Delaware residents filed for unemployment — in one week alone, 21,600 did. By contrast, before the onset of the crisis, weekly applications for unemployment in Delaware came in between 500 and 600.\n\nJob losses in Delaware have been heavily concentrated in accommodations and food services, though there has also been a slight decline in manufacturing employment. Banking and finance jobs, crucial in Delaware, have held up fairly well — in stark contrast to the last recession, which began, after all, with a financial crisis.\n\nIt’s notable the economic slowdown, particularly on the consumer side, was observable even before states like Delaware took serious action to curtail the spread of the virus. That strongly suggests that the coronavirus itself, and not just government policies designed to mitigate it, are harming the economy.\n\nBefore states and cities started imposing lockdowns and shutting down businesses that they deemed nonessential, data show the cutbacks in spending: Airline bookings were collapsing and foot traffic into restaurants had already begun a steep decline, for instance. Consumers were voting with their feet — or at least with their wallets.\n\nThe point is this: Until the virus itself is under control, even as more states gradually open up, we can expect the economy to underperform relative to where it was just a couple of months ago.\n\nFederal Reserve Actions\n\nDoes that mean we should simply sit on our hands until effective therapies, or a vaccine, emerges? Of course not. And as you probably know, our institution, the Federal Reserve, has taken bold action to help deal with the economic consequences of what is fundamentally a public health crisis.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have essentially found ourselves in the role of firefighter — and we’ve poured water on the fire. But we want to avoid damaging the underlying infrastructure of what just a few months ago was a very healthy economy. Our goal is to use our vast lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity.\n\nWe have, first and foremost, acted by lowering our policy interest rate to near zero — and we expect to keep it there for some time.\n\nWe’ve also taken a number of actions to keep credit flowing. Beginning in March, as the depths of the crisis became apparent, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to prevent credit markets from seizing up. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve now slowed the rate of those purchases.\n\nWe’re also focusing on using all of our available tools to get loans directly into the hands of those who need them most.\n\nTo do that, we’re going to be buying bonds from cities and states, most of whose sales tax revenues have tanked along with consumer spending. This program, called the Municipal Liquidity Facility, will provide essential liquidity to local governments as they fight the pandemic.\n\nWe’ve also set up what we’re calling our Main Street Lending facility. The goal here is to get cash in the hands of small- to medium-sized businesses whose operations have been hampered by the virus. These businesses tend to be the economic lifeblood of their local communities, and this lending facility is designed to forestall mass closures of small and medium-sized businesses on Main Streets across the country.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those crucial businesses.\n\nWe know that this crisis is severely harming the nonprofit sector as well. As a recovering academic and university president myself, I’m acutely aware of the stress this crisis is inflicting on, for instance, the higher education sector.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is thinking carefully about setting up facilities that can provide direct lending to colleges, universities, and nonprofit medical institutions. This is crucial for Delaware because “eds and meds” are vitally important to the state’s economy. Now, 17.4 percent of Delaware workers are employed in the sector, more than even work in professional and business services.\n\nI want to be clear. We’re not in 2009 anymore and this is not quantitative easing 2.0.\n\nThe principle behind quantitative easing was that people weren’t engaging in investments because the cost of capital was too high.\n\nThat is simply not the case now. The reason people aren’t engaging economically is the health crisis.\n\nI also want to be clear that these facilities — as well as the actions that have been taken on the fiscal side, especially the CARES Act that Congress passed a few weeks ago — are not economic stimulus.\n\nOur facilities, instead, are a form of emergency relief — of insurance. We’re doing everything we can to help people get through a really painful time.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nSo, now the $64,000, or perhaps the $22 trillion, question. What happens next economically?\n\nThe second quarter data will be brutally painful as a result of both the virus and the government-mandated economic shutdown. Take your pick of bad, really bad, or really, really bad.\n\nWhat happens after that to a large extent depends on how the virus moves through our society, and our reaction to it in terms of balancing stay-at-home policies versus an intelligent — and I want to stress, intelligent — reopening.\n\nThere are multiple scenarios as to how this plays out. But here are just two to consider: In the more optimistic scenario, the economy largely opens in June, we have technology in place to contain the spread of the virus, and there is no second wave in the fall.\n\nIn that scenario, I would expect a severe contraction in GDP in the second quarter followed by a significant rebound in the second half. However, the second half rebound is not enough to fully offset the contraction in Q1 and Q2; 2021 would then show above-trend annual GDP growth.\n\nThe less optimistic scenario is that we open too quickly and see a significant second wave of the virus. Not only would this be a health catastrophe, but it would reverse the recovery as well.\n\nIn this less hopeful scenario, I project a similar growth path to the baseline for 2020, followed by a painful economic contraction of GDP in 2021 as shutdowns are reintroduced.\n\nLonger term, of course, there will be a recovery. But I also want to stress that it might be an uneven one. There’s an old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats. But that might not apply here.\n\nManufacturers of durable goods, for instance, should come back quickly.\n\nOne large manufacturer in our District who temporarily halted operations reports that orders themselves never evaporated — they were simply delayed as virus mitigation measures took effect. But as Delaware and other states slowly and intelligently reopen, I think we can expect manufacturing output to quickly bounce back.\n\nTravel and hospitality, on the other hand, may be in for a longer and more painful contraction. Businesses may have enough experience teleconferencing instead of holding physical meetings that they may decide to cut back on corporate travel. Families may choose to avoid crowded spots like amusement parks, cruise ships, and packed Eastern Shore beaches. The knock-on effects to airlines, hotels, and restaurants that cater to travelers could be severe and long lasting. That, unfortunately, is bad news for southern Delaware, particularly Sussex and Kent counties, both of which rely heavily on tourism.\n\nDelaware, with its large port in Wilmington, is also exposed to the vicissitudes of the global economy. That was already visible in March’s data, where the total value of exports from the state totaled $335.5 million. That sounds like a lot except when you consider that in March 2019, the figure stood at a high of $711.8 million. A pickup in export values is dependent on economies in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere once again showing growth. But that too depends on how those countries manage the coronavirus and its economic fallout.\n\nCommercial real estate could also be in for a rough stretch. Companies may find that working from home isn’t so bad after all and reduce physical office space. There is also a strong possibility that many hotels and restaurants will never reopen. There will probably be retailers, big and small, that also shutter permanently.\n\nIn the long term, the uneven recovery will present a risk to our banking sector, which is heavily exposed to sectors like commercial real estate. The good news is we went into this crisis with a well-capitalized regulated financial system. But I want to urge banks to retain capital as we prepare to enter a tough period. In my personal opinion, they probably shouldn’t be issuing large dividends at the moment.\n\nI want to close by mentioning a subject dear to my heart: diners!\n\nNear my house up here in South Jersey there’s a diner that, just a few days after restaurants were shut down here, quickly turned into a full-service grocery store.\n\nNow, perhaps this only demonstrates the ingenuity of the South Jersey diner sector. And I’ll admit I’m biased on that score …\n\nBut I also think it underlines Americans’ boundless ability to adapt — to retool when the times call for it. I’m sure that we will get through this.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for having me here today … in some form …\n\nBefore we begin, let me dispense with the usual Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nIt’s no secret that we find ourselves in the midst of a crisis like none of us have experienced in our lifetimes. The coronavirus that arrived on our shores just a few months ago has already killed tens of thousands of Americans, ended a years-long streak of solid economic growth, and caused tens of millions of our fellow citizens to lose their jobs.\n\nIt’s amazing to think how different my remarks would have been had I given them just two months ago.\n\nAppreciation for the Frontline Workers\n\nThe coronavirus is above all a public health crisis and the Federal Reserve as an institution — and me personally — can’t say enough to adequately convey our gratitude toward America’s health-care workers, as well as other frontline workers like police, grocery-store workers, truck drivers, and innumerable others who are risking their own health for the well-being of the country.\n\nThe economic ramifications of this crisis, of course, have been stark as well.\n\nPerhaps most notable has been a collapse in most forms of consumer spending, a component of GDP that accounts for about 70 percent of our country’s economic activity.\n\nIn March, we experienced a literally unprecedented 7.5 percent fall in consumer spending, and April data will surely be even worse. In the same month, manufacturing output fell to levels not seen since 2011. And data from the Institute for Supply Management showed a stark contraction for April as well.\n\nIt’s notable that this diminution, particularly on the consumer side, was observable even before states took serious action to curtail the spread of the virus. That strongly suggests that the coronavirus itself, and not just government policies designed to mitigate it, are harming the economy.\n\nBefore states and cities started imposing lockdowns and shutting down businesses they deemed nonessential, data show the cutbacks in spending: Airline bookings were collapsing and foot traffic into restaurants had already begun a steep decline, to name just a few examples of weakening consumption demand in some categories of goods and services. Consumers were voting with their feet — or at least with their wallets.\n\nEven my presence here by Zoom is evidence that it isn’t only government mandates that have slowed the economy. It was a decision we took ourselves, to stay home and to stay safe.\n\nThe point is this: Until the virus itself is under control, even as more states gradually open up, we can expect the economy to underperform relative to where it was just a couple of months ago.\n\nDoes that mean we should simply sit on our hands until effective therapies, or a vaccine, emerges? Of course not. And as you probably know, our institution, the Federal Reserve, has taken bold action to help deal with the economic consequences of what is fundamentally a public health crisis.\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we have essentially found ourselves in the role of firefighter — and we’ve poured water on the fire. But we want to avoid damaging the underlying infrastructure of what just a few months ago was a very healthy economy.\n\nAccess to Liquidity for All\n\nOur goal is to use our vast lending powers to maintain our underlying economic infrastructure by making sure that every sector of the economy has access to liquidity. I realize that more needs to be done, that people and firms will need infusions of cash, and that all of this is occurring at an unprecedented pace.\n\nBut that is a role for the federal government. Working together, we can try to ensure that the necessary conditions for a recovery will be there when this health crisis has passed.\n\nRegarding Federal Reserve actions, we have, first and foremost, acted by lowering our policy interest rate to near zero — and we expect to keep it there for some time.\n\nWe’ve also taken a number of actions to keep credit flowing. Beginning in March, as the depths of the crisis became apparent, we started buying large amounts of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities to prevent credit markets from seizing up. The markets have largely stabilized, and we’ve now slowed the rate of those purchases.\n\nWe’re also focusing on using all of our available tools to get loans directly into the hands of those who need them most.\n\nTo do that, we’re going to be buying bonds from cities and states, most of whose sales tax revenues have tanked along with consumer spending.

These businesses tend to be the economic lifeblood of their local communities, and this lending facility is designed to forestall mass closures of small and medium-sized businesses on Main Streets across the country.\n\nRelatedly, the Federal Reserve is also bolstering the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program by supplying liquidity to financial institutions that are issuing loans to those crucial businesses.\n\nStress on Higher Education\n\nWe know that this crisis is severely harming the nonprofit sector as well. As a recovering academic and university president myself, I’m acutely aware of the stress this crisis is inflicting on, for instance, the higher education sector. The Federal Reserve is thinking carefully about setting up facilities that can provide direct lending to colleges, universities, and nonprofit medical institutions.\n\nI want to be clear. We’re not in 2009 anymore and this is not quantitative easing 2.0. The principle behind quantitative easing was that people weren’t engaging in investments because the cost of capital was too high.\n\nThat is simply not the case now. The reason people aren’t engaging economically is the health crisis.\n\nI also want to be clear that these facilities — as well as the actions that have been taken on the fiscal side, especially the CARES Act that Congress passed a few weeks ago — are not economic stimulus. There may be a time for stimulus later, after the acute phase of the health crisis has passed.\n\nOur facilities, instead, are a form of emergency relief — of insurance. We’re doing everything we can to help people get through a really painful time.\n\nSo, now the $64,000, or perhaps the $22 trillion, question. What happens next economically?\n\nThe second quarter data will be brutally painful as a result of both the virus and the government-mandated economic shutdown.

But that might not apply here.\n\nManufacturers of durable goods, for instance, should come back quickly.\n\nOne large manufacturer in our District who temporarily halted operations reports that orders themselves never evaporated — they were simply delayed as virus mitigation measures took effect. But as Pennsylvania and other industrial states slowly and intelligently reopen, I think we can expect manufacturing output to quickly bounce back.\n\nTravel and hospitality, on the other hand, may be in for a longer and more painful contraction. Businesses may have enough experience teleconferencing instead of holding physical meetings that they may decide to cut back on corporate travel.

            "content": "Good afternoon, and it is a pleasure to be here with you and to also be back on my old stomping grounds of the University of Delaware. Being here again feels like Groundhog Day — but without Sonny and Cher singing on the radio.\n\nAnother thing that feels like Groundhog Day is the usual disclaimer I say over and over again: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee or across the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me outline my remarks today. I will start with my outlook for the economy — which I know takes on greater significance since I am a voting member this year of the Federal Open Market Committee. My outlook for the economy — specifically for the labor market — ties into the final section of my speech: workforce development. In my view, with the labor market the tightest it has been in decades, now is the time to create new approaches to how companies hire, train, and retain employees and how the U.S. can create career paths for all of its workers.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet’s start with the economy. Overall, I think the economy is in good shape.\n\nWe are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I see growth returning to trend of about 2 percent this year, a view that is widely shared.\n\nFriday’s employment report showed the labor market began 2020 on the same positive trend it showed through 2019. We added 225,000 net new jobs in January — better than the monthly average of 175,000 for all of 2019. Hourly wages increased 3.1 percent from last January, and the unemployment rate stood at 3.6 percent.\n\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. That number sounds disappointing — compared with the stronger monthly gains we’ve seen in recent years. But it’s important to recognize that 100,000 jobs per month is more than enough to keep pace with the expected growth in the U.S. labor force. That’s one reason why I expect that the unemployment rate will stay below 4 percent for the next couple of years.\n\nThe health of the labor market, especially when it comes to paychecks, is key to my economic outlook since consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. The news in general continues to be good for the consumer sector. Thanks to the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years and growth in wages, consumers are upbeat about the economy. Consumer confidence is high, and the optimism should support household spending this year.\n\nAnother support to consumer spending this year is the prospect of more homeowners refinancing their mortgages. Research done at the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute[1] shows that lower rates in 2019 resulted in a large number of borrowers who are in a position to refinance their residential mortgages. Mortgage refinancing fuels consumption in two ways: First, homeowners are able to lower their monthly house payment, freeing up money that can be spent elsewhere. Second, homeowners may choose to extract some home equity by using a cash-out refinance. This also provides money for other consumer spending.\n\nOur research shows that in September 2019 — when the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 3.61 percent — about 19 percent of all active mortgages were refi candidates. The Bank’s research — supported by industry analysis — suggests that with no change in mortgage rates, about 60 percent of borrowers will probably refinance this year, and over the next two years, we would expect an estimated $11.2 billion in added consumption from this refi activity. On an individual level, an average homeowner would have about $2,000 to spend in extra consumption within the first year after refinancing — a nice lift to almost any budget.\n\nMy positive view about the consumer contrasts with concerns about business investment. Spending on new plant and equipment and intellectual property is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and other policies has continued to hold spending back. So, too, have international developments, including the global slowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nIt’s too early to say what impact the spread of the coronavirus will have on the global economy, but the negative effects on the Chinese economy and international travel are something to watch.\n\nThat’s my view on the labor markets and economic growth. Let me talk about the other side of the Fed’s dual mandate: inflation. We haven’t quite met our 2 percent inflation target, but we’re on track to get there. While the process has been a slow one, I still believe that the inflation rate will rise to meet our goal.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of a generally positive economic outlook and expectations that inflation will eventually hit the Fed’s target, I come to the part that everyone really cares about: rates. As you know, at the January FOMC meeting, the Committee decided unanimously to hold the federal funds rate target stable at the range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.\n\nMy own view right now is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how developments and the data unfold before taking any more action.\n\nThe Regional Economy\n\nTurning to Delaware and the Philadelphia region, the economic outlook is more mixed than the national one. Over the past five years, Delaware employment grew less than 1 percent per year, which is lower than the 1.5 percent posted for the nation. In the recent months, however, Delaware’s job growth has picked up to a rate similar to the national average. At a more granular level, northern parts of Delaware seem to be doing better than the southern parts.\n\nDelaware’s unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in December (slightly higher than the national figure). Unemployment in the southern areas tends to be higher.\n\nDelaware’s job growth has been reasonably broad based, with the usual suspects such as the financial industry and education and health care — often referred to as “Eds and Meds” — leading the way. The professional and business services sector has seen a slight decline in the past year. But this could be due to a reduction in temporary-service jobs, which show up in the business services sector. With the local labor market remaining tight, companies are shifting temporary and part-time workers into permanent, full-time jobs, which results in a reduction of employment in the professional and business services sector.\n\nIn the Philadelphia metro area, which, of course, encompasses parts of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, job growth had been running around 1.5 percent, until several years ago when it slowed to 1 percent annually. In general, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth since the last recession has outpaced that of the Pennsylvania average for the most part, but has been below that of the nation during the same period.\n\nLike Delaware, the Philadelphia metro area’s job growth has been consistently broad based for the past several years, thanks to net new job gains in Eds and Meds and professional and business services. The local labor market is also feeling the direct impact of e-commerce versus brick-and-mortar stores. We have had a decline in retail employment, but we are seeing continuous growth in transportation and warehousing employment.\n\nAs for the jobless rate, the Philadelphia area’s rate stood at 4.1 percent in December. This is lower than the state average but is higher than the national average. In recent months, we have seen a slight uptick in the region’s and the state’s unemployment rates. This is likely due to an increase in the labor force participation rate at the state level during the same period. As more people enter the labor force, the unemployment rate will temporarily increase until they find jobs.\n\nTight Labor Market Could Be a Workforce Development Opportunity\n\nThe very tight labor markets we are seeing locally and across the nation have put employers in a challenging position that was not evident in the years following the Great Recession. Companies report difficulty filling open positions, and many of those slots stay vacant for a long time. The difficult recruiting environment is also one that is likely to stay with us for some time as demographic trends indicate that the workforce will continue to age and the labor force relative to the population will continue to decline.\n\nThis challenge may also be viewed as an opportunity, and those that successfully invent new ways to attract workers will enhance their chances of success. Now is a chance to rethink the same-old, same-old ways of building a productive workforce. This can perhaps be done by rethinking job requirements or additional ways of training.\n\nOne such innovative program has begun in Philadelphia. It is a public–private partnership to train workers here in Philadelphia. This project was developed by the Bank’s Economic Growth & Mobility Project, in concert with Philadelphia Works and Comcast. It seeks to gain a better understanding of what programs and strategies expand opportunities for individuals who live in low- and moderate-income communities.\n\nThe pilot program, announced last fall, has Philadelphia Works providing the upfront investment for training workers to master the skills needed by Comcast. As part of this new financial model, Comcast is committed to paying for outcomes once they are achieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. Philadelphia Works provides the training. The model also creates a better feedback loop between employers and the workforce board to make the program more effective and responsive to changing employer and employee needs.\n\nThe program is helping Comcast find workers in a tight labor market and let me assure you: The tight labor market we hear about from most of you is not imagined. Economists at the Philadelphia Fed have been looking into the amount of time needed to fill positions in metro areas across the U.S. In our region, it took 41 days, on average, to fill a position. That was longer than the national average of 37 days, and put Philly 47th out of the 50 largest metro areas.\n\nIt is hard to say exactly why it takes longer in Philadelphia than in other places, but one thing our researchers noted is that job ads in the Philadelphia metro area tend to list slightly higher education requirements than other metro areas. This underscores a need to switch gears and investigate if programs such as the one I just mentioned could be adapted to the challenges you face.\n\nBut here’s another finding of the study that I found very interesting: The skills in highest demand in the Philadelphia region, and across the U.S., are not those dependent on acquiring a four-year degree, but instead are soft skills, such as communication, customer service, and teamwork. That could indicate that a rethinking of job requirements could help counter the tight labor market conditions that are a prevalent feature of the current economy. Sometimes that means a college or graduate degree is needed, but sometimes it doesn’t.\n\nThat leads to another issue about workforce development, an issue I have championed for a few years now. And it might be strange to hear this from me — a former president here at the University of Delaware — but not every high school graduate needs to go to college. And that would be even truer if there were greater innovation in recruiting and training. To reiterate, the difficulty of finding new employees is likely to be a feature of the labor market for some time to come because demographic trends are not short-run fluctuations. Innovation in attracting and retaining workers is likely to be one of the key aspects governing success. It expands the pool of workers, helping to create better matches and a more productive workforce. And, importantly it opens pathways for workers.\n\nOpportunity Occupations\n\nOf course, workers without a college degree still need to find well-paying jobs. As I mentioned earlier, my positive outlook for the U.S. economy rests on the consumer sector. We need everyone who wants a job to be able to find a well-paying and sustainable career path. Researchers within our Community Development and Regional Outreach Department have identified several employment categories that pay above the national annual median wage but do not require a four-year college degree. We call these opportunity occupations.\n\nMy colleague Keith Wardrip worked with researchers from the Cleveland Fed to catalogue these occupations by looking at education requirements in job postings and hourly wage data from the Labor Department. The list of opportunity occupations vary from registered nurses to truck drivers, retail sales supervisors, carpenters, and patrol officers. So whether a person likes dealing with people or working with their hands, and whether they are interested in a career in health care, construction, transportation, or sales, one of the many opportunity occupations may fit their idea of a good job.\n\nTo be clear, many of these jobs require on-the-job experience or some type of training after high school, and some positions advertised online required a college degree. But nationally, Keith and his colleagues calculated that 21.6 percent of jobs in 2017 could be classified as opportunity occupations. In the Philadelphia–Camden–Wilmington metro area, the share was slightly lower, at 20.1 percent.\n\nThese occupations offer workers without college degrees the chance to be part of our growing economy and to become financially secure. Giving more people the opportunity to participate in the economy strengthens our economy because more paychecks support increased consumer spending. It’s a win–win situation for all of us.\n\nIndeed, emphasizing skills rather than degrees might help to reverse a troubling longer-run trend in the U.S. economy, and that is the high number of adults who are not in the labor force. The share of working-age adults who are participating in the labor force — which includes those who are employed and those who are unemployed but actively looking for work — came in at just 63.1 percent in 2019, down from 65.4 percent 10 years ago. What this says to me is that the U.S. is missing out on the potential these adults could bring to the economy. This will, no doubt, require innovative thinking and new ways of investing in the workforce, but the payoffs are likely to be substantial.\n\nI know the popular notion is that artificial intelligence and robots will make workforce development unnecessary. But let me return to our study about the time needed to fill job openings and mention that the occupations that are hardest to fill include registered nurses, retail store managers, and physicians. These are jobs that are least at risk for automation. They require uniquely human skills and can’t easily be done by robots. Employers can’t expect these jobs to disappear any time soon, and that is why it is imperative for employers to invest in those unique humans who can develop the communication, teamwork, and service skills that will get the job done.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n1 The analysis is based on Black Knight McDash data and Equifax Credit Risk Insight Servicing data.",

So I won’t take it personally that the last time I spoke to this group was almost exactly three years ago …\n\nSome things look very different in 2020 than they did in 2017. The makeup of the Fed’s Board of Governors has changed. We are in a different part of the business cycle. My outlook for interest rates is markedly dissimilar. But some things have held firm. Specifically, while the outlook for rates may be starkly different, a lot of the phrases I used to describe the state of the economy back in 2017 still apply today.\n\nThat’s positive news and pretty amazing when you consider how much the world has changed since 2017.\n\nToday I will touch on three issues that are integral in today’s banking world. The first is the economic outlook, a key driver for loan demand and investment opportunities. The second is an aspect of monetary policy that has been in the news over the past few months; namely, how the Fed is normalizing its balance sheet. Last, I will touch on the ongoing efforts around modernizing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).\n\nLet me begin with the standard disclaimer — which I used three years ago — about my views being my own and not necessarily reflective of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nOverall, the economy is looking pretty good. We are in the longest economic expansion on record, and I see growth returning to trend of about 2 percent this year, a view that is widely shared.\n\nJust as I said last time I was here in 2017, I will note that the labor market continues to show considerable strength. In fact, it has outperformed most people’s expectations, with continued job creation, continued low unemployment, and more people continuing to come off the sidelines.\n\nAt some point, we’ll return to a trend of creating about 100,000 net new jobs per month. I’ve said that, too, in years past, and it hasn’t yet come to fruition, which is great for the American workforce. And when we do return to trend — whenever that may be — it’s important to note that, while 100,000 jobs a month may look disappointing in comparison with the strong numbers we’ve seen over the past several years, it will more than keep pace with growth in the labor force.\n\nMore good news in the labor market includes the fact that wages on the lower end of the pay scale have finally started to rise — as they have on the higher end — although midrange paychecks could still use a boost.\n\nThe continued strength of the labor market has contributed to booming consumer confidence. And with consumer spending making up some 70 percent of the U.S. economy, that makes it the hero in the growth story. Business investment, however, is lagging, and the uncertainty attached to fiscal and other policies, has continued to hold it back. So, too, have international developments, including the global slowdown, trade uncertainty, and geopolitical tensions.\n\nHere’s something else I said in 2017 — and in 2018 and in 2019 — while we haven’t quite met our 2 percent inflation target, we’re on track to get there. I still believe that inflation will rise to meet our goal, albeit slowly, and we’re closing in on the target. But it has been a long time coming. To most people, this is a purely academic problem — who else but policymakers are going to complain that inflation is hovering below 2 percent? But because of our dual mandate, focusing on the inflation rate is more than an academic exercise.\n\nNew Jersey’s Economy\n\nAs for the Garden State’s economy, some numbers show New Jersey outperforming the nation, and others show some shortfall — but not by a lot. And as a lifelong South Jersey boy, I am happy to say our state’s economy is in good shape. Job growth has hovered around 1 percent over the past three years, a little below the U.S. rate of about 1.5 percent. However, the unemployment rate is 3.4 percent, which is slightly better than the national average. That is despite the fact that New Jersey’s jobless rate has ticked up in recent months. But even here, I view the news as positive. That’s because the rise in the rate reflects more people coming back into the labor force. The state’s labor force participation rate has risen from about 62 percent last summer, to 63.6 percent at the end of 2019. That suggests more residents are feeling confident about the labor market and their ability to find work.\n\nI should mention that the Philadelphia Fed’s own state leading index for New Jersey recently turned negative. But that reflects the rise in the jobless rate. Since that rise is the result of more people coming into the labor market, I am not worried about New Jersey’s economic future.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nThe main subject of this speech is monetary policy. While it is usual to discuss interest rates, today I want to touch on another key aspect of monetary policy going forward, and that is the Fed’s efforts to normalize the balance sheet. This has received great attention lately, ever since the repo market problems of last September.\n\nAs you know, at the start of 2019, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary policy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively managed.\n\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to roughly a constant size come September. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grew, aggregate reserves naturally declined. Our end game was for reserves to reach a level “consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.”\n\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases by announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of reserves, which is itself filled with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\n\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, although we’ve conducted a great deal of research around the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversation with market participants. In fact, staff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to identify that the need for reserves could be much larger than initially anticipated. To be on the safe side, it made sense to move slowly, buying time to carefully observe market developments and better assess their implications. That is, we gave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown unknowns” of life.\n\nJust such an unknown arose in September.\n\nThe episode was clearly triggered by the outsized flows of funds to the Treasury. But the dates for tax payments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are fixed on the fiscal calendar and well known to both policymakers and markets. Everyone was expecting large liquidity flows.\n\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\n\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rose above 5 percent on Tuesday, September 17, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\n\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market did not freeze. The volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it had maintained for the past several months.\n\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The effective federal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed the top of the range by 5 basis points the next day.\n\nWe immediately took action to ensure that the effective fed funds rate returned to, and stayed within, the target range. The very next day, the Desk started repurchase operations to stem the pressures on money markets, and these actions have continued — including term operations — to date.\n\nIn October, the FOMC decided to restart asset purchases to keep reserves at or above the level reached in early September, at a little over $1.5 trillion. Additionally, the Desk has been conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to offset money market pressures — for instance, the quarter-end dynamics that are inevitably more burdensome at the year’s end. All in all, since September, we have supplied about $400 billion in additional reserves; about $250 billion via repo agreements, and the rest in asset purchases.\n\nThese measures clearly worked, with the effective fed funds rate maintaining a virtually constant level since October, and repo markets staying calm. Instead of wreaking havoc, the year’s end was a non-event.\n\nGoing forward, the Committee remains committed to implementing monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, which, again, does not require active management of the supply of reserves. The Treasury purchases announced in October will continue until at least the next quarter to ensure we meet that goal.\n\nCentral to this event is the question of why liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed most. Are some of the market’s pipes rusty? Clogged? Are more needed? Has regulation inadvertently contributed to some erosion or blockage?\n\nAnother question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit — whether we could, or should, do more to ensure interest-rate control. One possibility under discussion is a standing repo facility. We are in the process of evaluating such a facility’s potential costs and benefits, and exploring possible designs as well as alternatives, so it is still very much in the discourse, rather than the decision, phase.\n\nWhile September’s turmoil offered perhaps too much excitement, it also provided a good deal of information. It showed that we need a larger pool of reserves than most of our estimates had initially indicated. It showed that when reserves are scarce, even for as short a period as a week or so, it can generate large spikes in money market rates. And it showed, unfortunately, that banks remain extremely reluctant to borrow from the discount window, even when that reluctance results in outsized penalties far above the primary credit rate.\n\nCRA Modernization\n\nFinally, I know the banking community is awaiting final resolution to the discussion about modernizing the Community Reinvestment Act. Our meeting here today is taking place north of the jagged line that divides New Jersey between the New York Fed and the Philadelphia Fed. For those of you in the audience from South Jersey, you know that the discussion about the CRA takes on significant importance in the Fed’s Third District, and we have hosted one-on-one meetings, roundtable discussions, and conferences with both banks and community members to better understand their concerns and gather their insights on updates to the regulation.\n\nThe CRA was passed in 1977, and the last significant update to the legislation was done back in 1995. As regulators, we have heard feedback over the years for the need to update and revise the CRA, and in 2018, we began an interagency process to make significant changes that reflect modern banking and community needs.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed hosted a conference on CRA modernization in February 2019, and that event allowed us to listen as various community development experts and financial industry leaders weighed in on the best approach. We recognize there is value in modernizing the regulation to address the changing channels that serve customers beyond bank branches, to strengthen the law’s focus on local communities, and to help bring greater consistency and predictability to CRA ratings.\n\nAs you probably know, the FDIC and OCC released their proposals in the fall of 2019. Last week, Governor Lael Brainard unveiled the Fed’s own approach. The Fed’s proposal is based not only on the feedback we heard from bankers and communities but also insights from the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking public comment process and a thorough review of a number of performance evaluations. In my view, modernizing the CRA will help banks better meet the credit needs in the low- and moderate-income communities they serve.\n\nBecause these updates to the CRA will impact your business models, I assume that you have read the ideas and the metrics of the Fed’s plan, so I won’t go into much detail. But let me make some points about the Fed’s proposal.\n\nThe Fed is proposing the creation of two tests: a retail test to assess a bank’s record of retail loans and services in its assessment area; and a community development test for large banks, and wholesale and limited-purpose banks to measure a bank’s performance on community development loans, qualified investments, and other services. A separate retail test will align with the key focus of the CRA, which is to ensure that banks are meeting the credit needs of underserved markets. Separate tests also underscore the importance of the ability to tailor exams to each institution’s asset size, business lines, and local conditions.\n\nOur proposal also hones in on the importance of metrics and data dashboards, and distilling that data into helping banks better track and benchmark their CRA performance. We at the Fed like to say we are “data driven,” and these dashboards will show that data matter not just in monetary policy but in the work the Fed does in ensuring the U.S. has a robust and equitable financial system.\n\nTo reiterate what Governor Brainard said last Wednesday, “it is more important to get reforms right than to do them quickly.” I couldn’t agree more with that sentiment when it comes to an important piece of legislation like the CRA. To achieve that goal, regulators at the Fed are having discussions with the other banking regulators. We are mindful of the business costs that two sets of rules would impose on banks. And I am hopeful that we can create a consensus going forward.\n\nConclusion\n\nCongress gave the Federal Reserve a dual mandate to maximize employment and stabilize prices. The data show that the labor market is doing incredibly well, and I believe the economy is nearing our target inflation rate of 2 percent. All in all, my outlook for the economy is positive, but let me add that my outlook will continue to be driven by the data as each report is released throughout 2020.\n\nThe data will also determine my view on monetary policy. And policy entails more than interest rates. As the Fed oversees its balance sheet, we will be mindful of the unexpected, such as happened last September.\n\nAnd with that, let me open the floor up to questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "I’m a generally inquisitive person by nature, and one of the perks of being a Fed president is that indulging my curiosity is actually a job requirement — discussions like this give us good feedback and insight, and it’s important to maintain an open, transparent dialogue. So I’m very happy to be here. Though I should note the flipside: One of the perils of being a Fed president is that you open yourself to the risk that discussion turns into inquisition …\n\nToday’s roundtable is titled “Monetary Policy Normalization: Low Interest Rates and the New Normal,” and it’s probably telling that those 10 relatively short words contain multitudes.\n\nSo I’d like to start with a brief recap of the key issues and recent events that influence today’s conversation — or at least, as brief as I can make them — then head straight into the discussion.\n\nFirst, however, as is par for the course, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI always issue that disclaimer, but I’m highly aware that people care a lot more about what I have to say in years that I’m a voting member of the FOMC. So my New Year’s resolution is to say it whenever I speak, even if I’m just ordering a sandwich …\n\nOur initial intent for today was to focus on the unwinding of the balance sheet, and as you can see, I’m accompanied by my colleague Roc Armenter, who is one of the principal architects of our approach. But policy does not exist in a vacuum, and, of course, there are other, connected topics, including the disruption in the money markets last September.\n\nTo set the stage then, I’ll remind everyone of where we were, where we are, and where we’re going.\n\nIn the Beginning — Balance Sheet Normalization\n\nAs you know, at the start of 2019, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary policy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively managed.\n\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to roughly a constant size come September. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow, aggregate reserves see a natural, gradual decline. Our end game was for reserves to reach a level “consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.”\n\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases by announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of reserves, which is itself suffused with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\n\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, though we’ve conducted a great deal of research around the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversations with market participants. In fact, staff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to identify that the need for reserves could be much larger than initially anticipated.

The very next day, the Desk started repurchase operations to stem the pressures on money markets, which have continued — including term operations — to date.\n\nSince September 17, 2019, to the End of the Decade\n\nIn October, the FOMC decided to restart asset purchases to keep reserves at or above the level reached in early September, a little over $1.5 trillion. Additionally, the Desk has been conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to offset money market pressures — for instance, the quarter-end dynamics that are inevitably more burdensome at the year’s end.

Instead of wreaking havoc, the year’s end was a non-event. The money markets essentially rang in the New Year by binge watching Netflix in their PJs instead of with noisemakers and popped corks.\n\nImplementation Framework Going Forward\n\nGoing forward, the Committee remains committed to implementing monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves, which, again, does not require active management of the supply of reserves. The Treasury purchases announced in October will continue until at least the next quarter to ensure we meet that goal.\n\nCentral to this event is the question of why the liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed most. Are some of the market’s pipes rusty? Clogged? Are more needed?

And it showed, unfortunately, that banks remain extremely reluctant to borrow from the discount window, even when that reluctance results in outsized penalties far above the primary credit rate.\n\nMonetary Policy Review\n\nThis episode highlights that some fundamental shifts have occurred in market functioning. And, in fact, as the world’s economies rebuilt over the course of the lengthy recovery, we’ve come out the other side to a state of normalcy that doesn’t look exactly like it did before the financial crisis.\n\nLast year, we began a broad review of the strategies, tools, and communication practices we use in pursuit of our monetary policy goals. Again, that’s an important undertaking on both a philosophical level and as a general exercise in good practice. But it’s also important because we find ourselves in new territory, as the U.S. economy has changed in ways that impact the efficacy of our policymaking. In particular, the natural rate of interest, both at home and abroad, appears to have fallen, increasing the possibility of moving ever closer to the zero lower bound, which, in turn, dilutes the power of our monetary policy tools in combatting downturns.\n\nIt’s been said often, but bears repeating, that a change to our 2 percent inflation goal is not on the table. But it is nonetheless a wide-ranging review. As you may have seen in the minutes from the FOMC’s September meeting, makeup strategies were discussed, and we reviewed the utility of unconventional policy tools — such as balance-sheet policies and forward guidance — in October. We expect to reach some preliminary findings by midyear, but we also expect these conversations to be ongoing.\n\nI’ve personally found this exercise to be fascinating from an academic standpoint and vital from the policymaker’s roost. But the highlight for me has really been the series of Fed Listens events spearheaded by Vice Chair Clarida. Each of the 12 District Banks hosted outreach and consultation events with a broad range of people and groups, including labor leaders, nonprofits, community leaders, and local business owners. Even though the economy is in good shape, it works differently for different people and places, and it’s important to put context and contour to the discussion.\n\nI’m going to end with that observation, because we’re here for a discussion, not a monologue, and I’m more than ready to dive into the context and contour you bring to the discussion.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to be back in Blue Hens territory, and I am truly happy to be here this evening.\n\nI’ve worn a few professional hats in my day, each of which required a certain degree of measured speech and withholding personal opinion. There are things you can and can’t say in almost every job, and that’s never been more true, for me, than as a Fed president. We have to be measured and circumspect about how and when we speak. We steer away from controversial political and social issues. But I do feel, in this room tonight, that I would be remiss if I didn’t draw attention to a flagrant blow to the heart of Delaware culture and tradition. How on earth is punkin chunkin moving to Illinois!?\n\nSince I have, now, delved into a deeply important social issue, it’s a good time to give my colleagues concrete deniability and share the requisite Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that taken care of: I’ve spent a lot of years talking in front of crowds, mostly in the realm of academia. So my audiences have largely been required to show up and listen to the hour I had to fill. On this occasion, however, I’m going to keep my remarks short, because I get much more out of your questions and hearing what you have to say than I do from lecturing, and I’m positive it’s also more interesting for you than listening to a policymaker drone on. Not to mention that I’ve found that those conversations are significantly more lively after everyone’s had a good dinner and a glass or two of wine … so with that, I’ll give a brief outlook on the economy and where I see policy headed, then turn it over to you for questions.\n\nThe headline on my views these days is: not much news. Despite spirited conversations on all aspects of the economy, my outlook has stayed relatively steady.\n\nStarting with employment, I feel comfortable saying that we’ve met our remit. The labor market continues to evince remarkable strength. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and the pace of job creation continues at above the rate we’ll need to keep pace with growth. That continued resilience is important, particularly in the Philadelphia Fed’s District — where many of our cities and towns trail national averages — because as the market gets tighter and tighter, it starts to finally reach the people who are most likely to miss out on the good fortune of positive economic trends. There are still people on the sidelines, and we have continued to see more of them reenter the workforce. More people on the margins are finding their way back into employment and a future. And from the business perspective, the biggest issue on the labor front has been a lack of skills and a lack of workers. So the more people, the better, all around.\n\nI do want to note that this trend obviously can’t go on forever and, at some point, the pace of job creation will slow. When that happens, there’s likely to be a decent amount of doom and gloom in the headlines and laced through the commentary. But it’s important to remember that about 100,000 jobs a month or so is trend; it’s what we’ll need to keep pace with growth, and we’ve been seeing rates much higher than that for several years. That said, I do still see unemployment staying below the 4 percent mark for the next couple of years, assuming that conditions play out more or less as expected.\n\nTurning to the inflation side of our mandate, this is, of course, the one that’s proven more difficult. Inflation has not only shied away from our 2 percent goal for some time, it’s defied our predictions of when it will finally get there time and time again. With that in mind, I want to note that inflation is not running backwards; rather, it’s edging up — to be fair, it is sometimes taking a step back after two steps forward. But it is on track, and it is heading, on average, in the right direction. Ultimately, I do see it reaching our goal in the next 18 to 24 months.\n\nGrowth has also captured some negative headlines, but again, I think they mischaracterize the data: On the aggregate, it has continued to meet our expectations. I remain of the opinion that we’ll see GDP growth of a little above 2 percent for 2019, returning to trend of about 2 percent next year.\n\nWhether or not 2 percent is an adequate pace of growth has been another subject of debate, but there is, by and large, consensus among economists and forecasters that this is trend. And from a policy perspective, there isn’t much that monetary policy can do to change that. I’ve said before — ad nauseam, really — that the power and reach of monetary policy is relatively constricted. Meaningful change to the nation’s growth trajectory requires fiscal policy. The Fed can create the conditions for growth to take root, but for it to flourish, it needs the nourishment of legislative action.\n\nWe are riding the wave of the longest economic recovery on record, and that’s a positive. The economy is in a good place.\n\nThat said, there are, of course, headwinds, the strongest being uncertainty. Trade and international developments, including slowing overall global growth, have cast a shadow of ambiguity. And as anyone who’s sat on a corporate board can tell you, in those situations, when the future is murky, you wait to make decisions. And while the consumer has been the hero of this year’s growth story, that can’t be the single engine. We need business investment to drive the economy as well.\n\nNormally, that’s where I’d stop with an outlook speech, but I have the premier collection of Delaware’s real estate community in front of me, so I don’t think I can get away without mentioning the housing market.\n\nOn the residential side, home price growth has slowed down noticeably in the past several years. However, the figures have been improving in recent months. And while current readings of inventory, as well as construction, of single-family housing remain low relative to their historical norms, they are improving. Low mortgage rates in the recent months have also had some impact. On the consumer side, delinquency rates continue to fall, signaling a healthier credit market. For the Fed’s Third District, the overall story is similar to the national one. However, as with many indices in our area, the recovery has taken a bit longer to reach our local markets.\n\nWith the outlook generally positive, and the economy in a good place, I come to the part that everyone really cares about: rates. My own view is that we should hold steady for a while and watch how things unfold before taking any more action. I am not a voting member on the FOMC this year, but I held this same view regarding the last two cuts. I would have preferred to hold firm. And while it wasn’t my preference, it does act as a good reminder that monetary policy in the United States is a deliberative process. Every region of the country is represented around the table, and policy made by a plurality of views and opinions will necessarily be thoughtful and temperate.\n\nWith all that said and done, it’s time to move the floor over to you. One of the most important sources of information for a Fed president is the people who see major industries and sectors from the ground. Your insight is invaluable, and I’m most looking forward to what you have to say. Especially about the catastrophic loss of punkin chunkin.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

It really is important to have this group assembled here to have these conversations, so I first want to thank everyone for coming.\n\nSecond, I want to deliver a disclaimer that’s familiar by now to our friends and partners: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe agenda topics are so important because we’re addressing the future of work at a distinctive point of history. No one here needs to be told that the landscape of work is changing. But I would argue that that’s always been the case: From the Industrial Revolution to the rise of Silicon Valley, we have always found new and more efficient ways of doing things. It’s a fundamental part of the human story.\n\nThings are, however, a bit different this time around. For one, the change is coming a lot faster than it used to. For another, the labor market itself is different. Together, they create a unique set of circumstances that pretty much gives us the chance of a lifetime.\n\nUnemployment is at a half-century low. Businesses are having trouble finding skilled workers. This has, to some extent, forced us to view the workforce from a new perspective. In an employers’ market, it’s easy to see jobs as individual vacancies; there’s a seemingly endless supply of candidates, each one more credentialed than the last. But when the candidates are in shorter supply than the jobs, we have to think about how to solve the problem systemically — not just to fill the vacancies we have now, but to train, recruit, and upskill a workforce that can adapt to future needs. Because we know that future is coming at us fast.\n\nAn abundance of research, including from the Philadelphia Fed, has shown the effect automation will have — and is already having — on work. There is no question that technology is altering or eliminating some jobs, just as it has throughout history. Research shows, however, that other hallmarks of those previous cycles are also evident now: Where some jobs are destroyed, others will emerge. The Luddites may have been right about how the mechanized loom would affect them individually, but it created a boom in the textile industry that required a host of new workers. Today, too, we see new jobs arising from the exact machines that rendered the old ones obsolete: Even five years ago, who’d heard of a professional drone operator? Now employers can’t find enough of them.\n\nWhat’s crucial in the research on artificial intelligence is that we don’t just know what jobs are likely to go, we know who’s likely to be most affected. It’s the people who are already disproportionately represented among vulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger people, and workers in lower-skilled positions. But this presents an opportunity. We can pinpoint the people who’ll need support; the people businesses can view as the next wave of skilled workers. That allows businesses to create a pool of desperately needed talent, but more importantly, it means we can create access to careers, instead of the soul-crushing cycle of taking a job, losing it to a machine, finding a new one, and being automated out of that. This is an incredible opportunity, as long as we make that investment, and make it in the right way.\n\nWe have an abundance of research that points to the skills we’ll need in, and for, the future. People will need technological skills, of course — everything from your sandwich order at Wawa to health care is being digitized. But one of the most important lessons of AI’s march forward is that it makes the advantage of distinctly human skills entirely clear. More than anything right now, employers are looking for those abilities, the “soft skills” that can’t be robotized. Which means that as we look at the methods and programs we put into place to train people — whether they’re our existing staff, people who’ll be displaced by automation, or people still on the sidelines — we know that technical skills are key, but they should be taught with an emphasis on adaptability and critical thinking. We need programs that arm people with practical knowledge, while honing those core, uniquely human skills that will allow them to not just perform well in one specific job, but to succeed as that job — and the next one — evolves. And, importantly, to move up the professional ladder.\n\nOne of the most important factors in this event’s discussions is that it convenes a multitude of players. Because none of this can be accomplished by a single group or sector.\n\nIt would be easy to frame this discussion in terms of outcomes — who benefits and why that should motivate them. But the truth is, there’s no one discrete incentive for any particular sector; there are a thousand good reasons, all intertwined, that matter to all of us. A skilled, adaptable workforce is good for everyone. It gets business done, it draws investment to cities, and it lifts the local economy. It helps us build more inclusive growth and a more equitable society.\n\nAnd it stands to reason that if we all benefit, we should all play a part.\n\nEach of us, whether we come from a public, private, philanthropic, or academic organization, has expertise that the rest of us need.\n\nIt’s a core tenet of management science that the most effective leaders assemble a team of experts.\n\nIn our work at the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve gathered examples of this in our Research in Action Labs. Our academic research provides a host of evidence that we’re working to apply practically in communities around our District. But it obviously wouldn’t work if we just marched in and told people what the academic paper says we should do. We have to have partners from all corners — they’re the ones with the expertise. So when, for instance, we launched the first RIA Lab in northeastern PA to improve transportation infrastructure, we had representatives from the community, business, labor, city officials. Everyone played a role.\n\nWhat’s important about this is that we collectively found a way to address both the region’s and individual participants’ specific issues. For instance, Geisinger, the main health-care provider in the region, is feeling the industry-wide pressure of rapidly increasing need coupled with a workforce in short supply. And like any other job, if your employees can’t get to you, you don’t have a staff. But a light bulb went off during the process that they could solve a second problem: They were losing money when people didn’t show up to their appointments. So they started an “appointment navigator” initiative to cover those last miles, whether by van, taxi, or ride share, to ensure their patients could get there.\n\nThat’s the kind of creative thinking we need right now. And while each city and town is unique, we now have a blueprint we can hand to other areas.\n\nSo this conversation between and across experts is vitally important, and that outside-the-box thinking is equally crucial. We hear from employers, for instance, that there’s a massive skills shortage. And there’s evidence to back that up. But we also hear from hiring experts — and our own research shows — that some of that might be mitigated by different attitudes and approaches to recruiting.\n\nOur economists analyzed a huge data set — more than 90 percent of all online postings — to look at the factors affecting the length of time a job stays open. One of those researchers, Ryo Tashiro, will discuss this study with you, so I’ll keep the spoilers to a minimum. But overall, they found what we would expect, which is that routine, manual positions filled quickly and the ones requiring cognitive skills stayed open longer. Or, the ones most likely to automate were most easily filled, while the ones requiring innately human skills were hardest. They also found that the higher the bar for educational attainment or years’ experience, the more time the position went unfilled.\n\nThe clear lesson is that it’s harder to hire a psychologist than an assembly-line worker. But there may be something more, something we saw in a different area of research. “Opportunity occupations” are ones that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a four-year degree. And while, by definition, they don’t require a traditional degree, there was evidence that employers began inflating degree and experience expectations in the years after the recession. We saw this trend in other areas as well, and while it has largely reversed itself, it’s a good reminder to think about what we’re really looking for. As someone who comes from academia, it surprises people when I say we often assign too much power to that traditional degree. This moment requires thinking creatively, and that includes reassessing our assessment. Looking beyond degrees as the sole benchmark of skill can help mine those untapped resources.\n\nAnd, finally, that shift in thinking has to extend to how we see workers — not as an expense, but an investment; a core asset that’s essential to the business. That could be upskilling existing staff or investing in local potential. All those people at risk of being automated out of a job could go through the revolving doors of the traditional “train and pray” model or we can invest in them to give them, and Philadelphia, a better future.\n\nObviously, we can’t ask people to make an investment we’re not willing to make ourselves. In 2018, the Philadelphia Fed brought on Social Finance to help us launch an innovative new funding model for workforce investment — one that allows private sector firms to be investors, rather than simply serving on boards or allocating philanthropic dollars.\n\nOutside of this room, that might not sound radical. But in the world of public-private partnerships, it’s essentially turning the old model on its head. And we’re very pleased that two of those partners are with us today.\n\nThe first is Philadelphia Works, our local workforce investment board, which will be providing the upfront investment in this pilot training program. The other is a company that is on the frontline of technological and workforce change, and knows firsthand the skills that are vital to Philadelphia: Comcast.\n\nAs part of this new financial model, Comcast is committed to paying for outcomes once they are achieved, such as staying on the job for over six months. The model also creates a better feedback loop between employers and the workforce board to make it more effective.\n\nAt the heart of this partnership are the subjects we’re tackling here today: training that develops both technical and adaptive skills; a collaborative approach that brings in experts across sectors; and a fundamental understanding that workforce development is an investment.\n\nAnd now, I’m very pleased to introduce one of the people who made this pilot happen, the co-founder and CEO of Social Finance, Tracy Palandjian.\n\nUnder Tracy’s direction, Social Finance is leading the field of Pay for Success financing and Social Impact Bonds. She brings an unparalleled perspective to this conversation, so please help me welcome her to share some of those insights.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s great to be here, and to share space on an agenda with so many experts and voices of authority on community banking issues, including some of my Federal Reserve colleagues. The one problem is that when you speak on day two of a conference like this, you run the risk that your colleagues already made the most important points, and you’ll just sound repetitive.\n\nAnd while we hopefully won’t sound exactly the same, I’m sure we’re all touching on at least some of the same themes. Because if there’s one thing that I’ve found unanimous agreement on, it’s the importance of community banks.\n\nSince I’m mentioning the views of my Fed colleagues, now is probably a good time to interject the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. Which is something else you’ve probably already heard...\n\nAs I said, if there is one overarching message to both this conference and our work within the Federal Reserve, it is the critical importance of community banks. The Philadelphia Fed is largely a community bank supervisor, so we have a front-row seat to the effects of community banking throughout our District, and the way it’s embedded in the DNA of our local economies.\n\nWe were particularly proud to note that the winning team in the CSBS’s case study contest was won by a Pennsylvania school — congratulations again to Juniata College — and, in fact, almost one-third of the teams hailed from Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed has the smallest geographic District in the System, which I actually see as a strategic advantage. Within those borders, we have areas that reflect the makeup of the country as a whole: urban, rural, suburban, postindustrial. So we get insight on a diverse set of economic profiles. Our size also makes it easier to spend time out in the District, talking to business and community leaders to get a better take on what they’re seeing day to day. Something I’ve seen again and again is that the places that are doing well are the places where there’s a strong community banking presence. In fact, I’d say that, particularly for smaller cities and towns, community banks are essential to their economic success.\n\nBut community banks don’t just have local or regional impact; the insight we get from our contacts gives context to a remarkably complex national economy. And that factors into my own views on monetary policy when we’re considering what steps to take for the country as a whole.\n\nI often note that the U.S. economy — the biggest, and arguably most complex, in the world — is fundamentally just a collection of myriad microeconomies. It’s communities and localities, neighborhoods and families, and businesses of all sizes. As both businesses and as the touchstones of those individual economies, community banks play a key role in their success.\n\nFor that reason, it’s important that regulators recognize — and help mitigate — the challenges you face. Because there are several issues on the horizon, including technological change, demographic pressures, and regulatory burden.\n\nAgain, I know I’m repeating the messages you’ve already heard from my colleagues and contemporaries. But given the importance of community banks to the economy and the financial system, they’re worth repeating.\n\nTechnological Change\n\nI’m being followed on the agenda by a panel on technology’s impact on banking, and that’s been a central discussion across industries for some time. Cybersecurity, of course, has been a concern for banks of all sizes, but the pressure on smaller institutions can intensify when they can’t attain the same economies of scale as the larger ones.\n\nThen there are advances in fintech and changes to businesses of all sorts with the continued march of overall technological disruption.\n\nWe at the Philadelphia Fed have a particular focus on technological advancement — how machine learning and AI affect the workforce and business decisions; how it’s impacting choices people make about education and training; and how, frankly, it is changing the entire economic landscape. And community banks are certainly not immune.\n\nBut I think there are two important things to remember for this sector in particular.\n\nFirst, that change isn’t new; it’s been a constant feature of the industry for decades. It just looks different now. Second, I think those advancements in general amplify the unique importance of community banks, and, in fact, create opportunities.\n\nTaking those in turn, technological change itself is not new — many of you have been in the industry for a long time and have seen that firsthand. Fintech absolutely presents a fundamental change in the way we bank — but so did securitization, credit scoring, and prepaid cards. So did ATMs. It’s true that they all look pretty quaint when you compare them to today’s technology — just like a Walkman looks virtually antique compared to a streaming app on your phone. But both the Walkman and the ATM were revolutionary at the time.\n\nBanking has seen constant change and churn for the past half century. The difference is that today’s technology makes the delivery system more advanced than ever before, and it turbocharges the pace of change. Peer-to-peer lending, for instance, has been going on since humanity first established a barter system; it’s just being delivered via a different platform. In my day, it took the form of Frankie borrowing $20 from Jimmy at the local bar. I suppose one big difference is that Jimmy knew where Frankie lived, so default rates were significantly lower in the low-tech version.\n\nOverall, however, with fintech, it’s the platform that’s new, rather than the product or service.\n\nThat, of course, presents a business opportunity. It’s likely that partnerships between community banks and fintechs are going to increase, because the fundamentals of the banking system aren’t going to change. Whatever mode or method technology provides to deliver those services, they still need a trusted broker of money. And while bigger institutions may be better positioned to take on the risk of a fintech partnership, the fundamental advantage of community banks is the high level of trust their customers have in them. While community banks will obviously have to do their due diligence in forming partnerships, I’d argue that their deep base of trust is a valuable, competitive asset from the fintech perspective.\n\nThe second technology-based issue is the advances in AI and machine learning, which actually makes the case that the skills and expertise particular to community banking are more important now than ever before. Technology is only as smart as the data we input, and, particularly in the case of functions like algorithmic lending, the advantage of community banking is even more clear cut.\n\nCommunity banks know their customers. There’s a local understanding that can’t be programmed into a one-size-fits-all approach to lending. You heard yesterday from the Bank of Bird-in-Hand’s CEO Lori Maley. They’re actually an example I often use, because it’s a perfect case study in local understanding. On paper, the communities they serve wouldn’t look creditworthy to most banks. But Bird-in-Hand knows that when something happens, the community comes together to fix it. When a barn burns down, the community comes together to build a new one. If someone’s in danger of missing a scheduled payment, the community pools their resources to make it. That knowledge and understanding of who your customers are is an advantage that just can’t be replicated by an algorithm.\n\nMy daughter and son-in-law encountered the same thing when they tried to buy insurance for their first house. Philadelphia, like most places, has some linguistic quirks, like the extra “r” in the word water — or “werder.” We also have row houses, while most of the East Coast has townhouses or brownstones. In conversation, it’s not a big deal. In real estate dealings, it’s a very different story. My daughter’s first broker didn’t have row houses listed in the database, and they couldn’t just reclassify the property because the roof didn’t fit the narrow description of the alternatives. After a lot of time spent in a “Who’s on First”-type back and forth, they walked down the street to a local agent who got the insurance approved that day.\n\nThat’s just one example of how a molehill can turn into a mountain for customers. And the flexibility community banks have to meet local needs creates a loyal base.\n\nSo it’s not just that technology highlights the competitive advantage of community banks’ local knowledge; I honestly think it creates an opportunity as that specialist insight becomes more and more clear in comparison.\n\nDemographic and Other Changes in Community Banking\n\nSo community banks have expert local knowledge, they know their customers, and they reflect the needs of the communities they serve. But the demographics of communities across the country are changing, as is the community banking landscape. Since 2009, the number of community banks has declined by about one-third. Nationwide, bank failures have accounted for about a fifth of the reduction, while the rest are due to M&As. In the Philadelphia Fed’s District, the reduction in community banks has been slightly higher than the national average over that period — 38 percent for the Third District versus 34 percent nationwide. But the size of banks in the Philadelphia Fed’s District has increased significantly more than the national average, with Third District banks’ median assets increasing by 89 percent, versus the national rate of 57 percent. Those data point to rates of M&A activity that appear to have strengthened the resulting institutions and community banking overall. Over the same decade, we’ve seen a concurrent change in the asset mix with a significant rise in multifamily loans — 91 percent overall — though they still represent just 4 percent of total assets. And while securities have declined slightly, they remain the largest portion of the asset mix at 17 percent.\n\nSo while there are fewer community banks in the District, they’ve grown larger and more complex.\n\nDemographic changes, such as aging and increasingly less-mobile populations, have already affected community banking as a whole, and that will likely continue, meaning they may have to rethink their business models. That might mean more personal lending and greater small business lending. It could mean more commercial real estate lending or more projects with greater potential risk, but also greater possibilities for reward. From the regulatory and supervisory perspective, it will be important to watch for those changes and work to take them into account.\n\nRegulatory Burden\n\nWe do a lot of work on economic mobility in our District, and community banks have been central to our impact. Given how much is tied up in their success, I think it’s incumbent on us as regulators to be supportive of community banks’ continued viability.\n\nWe are well aware of the regulatory burdens that community banks have faced. I think that humanity has a propensity to overcorrect in response to crisis, so the pendulum sometimes swings a bit too far in the other direction. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, it made sense to put every mechanism in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. But there’s virtually universal agreement that community banks wound up on the wrong end of that pendulum swing. We’ve made progress in correcting that, including easing up on timelines and reporting requirements, but there’s still more to do.\n\nFor me, a crucial element is how we work with banks. It’s important that we’re able to fix errors by working together, rather than at odds; to distinguish mistakes from bad faith. It’s also critical that we continue to provide research and support. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve been looking at succession planning in particular, and our LINC program helps build relationships between community banks and community development organizations.\n\nBecause community banks play such a vital role in the vibrancy of local communities, it’s important that their business strategies take that impact into account, particularly for groups on the margins. And from the regulatory side, it’s important to make space for efforts that might involve more risk, but also have the potential for greater reward.\n\nWe have a bank in our District, ESSA Bank & Trust, that partnered with an existing program to ease ex-offenders’ transition back into the community. They’ve set aside $250,000 to make loans of up to $15,000 per person for housing, transportation, or education and training. The participants have to take financial literacy courses and provide a plan for the loan: One needed a car to get to work, one trained to become a commercial truck driver, one started a small business.\n\nSo far, things are going well. But I would argue that even if they did lose money, there’s more to consider. ESSA is investing in their community, in an important way that’s often overlooked and generally underfunded. It has the potential for a significant return on investment for the community, and that creates a new customer base for the bank. I think there’s room for flexibility and a little more risk appetite to encourage innovation.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up: Community banks are important. They play vital roles in communities across the country, and they make the difference between a local economy that merely survives and one that thrives. They offer insight to policymakers and a chance at success to their customers.\n\nThere are challenges, as there are in any industry. We’ve moved the needle on some, while others still have a ways to go. It’s important that we work together as we address them, because the outcomes will have effects that resonate beyond a single sector. Because ultimately, community banking matters to all of us.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to be here today.\n\nOne of the great joys of this job is being surrounded by some of the world’s best economists and policy experts, whose ideas and insights are central to the Fed’s work and mission. On occasions such as today, we sometimes take the opportunity to share new research by Fed staff or an idea that we’ve been debating.\n\nSometimes life makes those choices for us.\n\nGiven the turmoil in the money markets last week, this seems to be one of those times.\n\nSo with that in mind, I’ll start with a quick outlook for the economy, then delve into what happened last week, and what it means. Spoiler alert: It does not affect the stance of monetary policy or have a meaningful impact on the economy.\n\nI thought I’d get that out there nice and early.\n\nAs I venture into this discussion, I’ll start with the requisite Fed disclaimer that you’ve all heard before — and that some of you have delivered yourselves — that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nWith that caveat firmly in place, the headline is that my outlook hasn’t really changed.\n\nThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength, and we’re creating jobs above the rate we need to keep pace with growth. I expect unemployment to stay below the 4 percent mark for the next couple of years, assuming economic conditions unfold as forecast.\n\nInflation has been persistently below target for some time, but it does appear to be on track to meet our preferred 2 percent goal — albeit slowly — and I think we’ll get there in the next 18 to 24 months.\n\nWhile concerns about growth have been amplified lately, the trajectory looks to be about on track with our recent forecasts. Consumers continue to be the engine powering growth, fueled by the strong labor market. I continue to see overall GDP growth for 2019 a little above 2 percent, returning to trend of about 2 percent next year.\n\nThat said, there are clear downside risks, mostly posed by trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed. It is that uncertainty, more than anything, that is affecting business decisions. We hear it again and again from our contacts, it surfaces over and over in the Beige Book, and it’s showing up in data on confidence and investment across multiple sources.\n\nThat leads me to a point I’ve made before. Fed watchers often note that many of us have themes or phrases we return to often. Two of my most frequent are: It’s important to remember that growth is fundamentally the simple sum of growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity. And monetary policy is a relatively blunt tool with relatively limited scope. The Federal Reserve can pull the levers available to us to create a more hospitable environment for growth, but trend economic growth is driven by fiscal policy. Monetary policy can’t mitigate risk or move the growth needle in a meaningful way.\n\nNow that I’ve delivered my oratorical calling cards, the issue people care about most: rates. My own view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out.\n\nAnd with that, I’ll to turn to the other topic on everyone’s mind.\n\nWhat Just Happened?\n\nAs a quick recap: Last week, there was unusual stress in money markets, due primarily to funds flowing to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle Treasury security purchases. There was a significant surge in repurchase — or “repo” — rates early in the week, which put upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate, and, in fact, pushed it above the top of the target range on Tuesday.\n\nWhile interest-rate control and market functions are obviously important issues, I want to reiterate my opening note that they neither reflect — nor direct — the stance of monetary policy. Nor do they have implications for the wider economy.\n\nIt’s clear that last week’s episode was triggered by the outsized flows of private sector funds to the Treasury. But the dates for tax payments and bond settlements are not a surprise; they are fixtures of the fiscal calendar and well known to both policymakers and markets. Everyone was expecting large liquidity flows.\n\nThe impact, however, was clearly much larger than anyone anticipated, markets included.\n\nThe repo market took the brunt of the impact, as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rose above 5 percent last Tuesday, with some trades executed at rates as high as 10 percent.\n\nWhile this was certainly not an average day, it’s important to note that the repo market didn’t freeze. The volume of secured overnight finance remained steady, at the $1.2 trillion level it has maintained for the past several months.\n\nThe funding pressures in secured markets passed through to the federal funds market. The effective federal funds rate rose to the top of target range on Monday the 16th, and surpassed the top of the range by 5 basis points the next day.\n\nThat day, Tuesday, the New York Fed’s Open Market Trading Desk started repurchase operations to stem the pressures on money markets, and continued them for the duration of the week. Additionally, two technical adjustments were agreed upon at last week’s FOMC meeting: First, the interest paid on reserves was set 20 basis points below the top of the target range; and second, the overnight reverse repo rate was set 5 points below the bottom of the target range.\n\nThose measures successfully relieved funding pressures, and the effective fed funds not only moved back within the target range, it came down to 10 basis points below the range’s ceiling that Thursday and has remained there. Conditions started to normalize in repo markets as well, with repo rates drifting lower on Thursday and Friday, and starting this week around 1.85 percent. In fact, there was a significant drop in the fraction of volume in the federal funds market that traded at rates above the target range. For instance, less than 1 percent of the total fed funds volume was priced outside the target range.\n\nOn Friday, the Desk announced that it would initiate a series of repo operations — including several term operations — to help keep the fed funds rate within the target range. Those operations will continue until October 10. We have seen strong demand for repo operations this week, possibly indicating that funding pressures may return on quarter-end, and the Desk stepped up the operation limits yesterday. As Chair Powell noted at the post-meeting press conference, we will continue to monitor market developments and adjust operations as necessary to ensure that rates in the federal funds market stay within the target range.\n\nThe obvious question that arises — and indeed has been asked — is whether the current level of reserves is appropriate. And whether the Fed might need to expand its toolkit to better manage interest rates.\n\nI don’t think we can adequately answer those questions without first taking a step back and seeing them in their wider context.\n\nAs you know, earlier this year, the FOMC decided that we would continue to conduct monetary policy in a regime of “ample reserves,” in which control over the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates, and the supply of reserves does not need to be actively managed.\n\nShortly after that, we announced our plan to cease asset redemptions and hold the balance sheet to roughly its post-redemption size. As currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow, aggregate reserves see a natural, gradual decline. Our end game was for reserves to reach a level “consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.”\n\nThere were two primary objectives to this approach. First, to reduce uncertainty about asset purchases by announcing our plans well in advance. Second, to approach the necessary level of reserves, which is itself suffused with uncertainty, with an abundance of caution.\n\nWe only have estimates of the demand for reserves, though we’ve conducted a great deal of research around the Federal Reserve System, including continued conversation with market participants. In fact, staff at the Philadelphia and New York Feds were among the first to identify that the need for reserves could be much larger than anticipated. To be on the safe side, it made sense to move slowly, buying time to carefully observe market developments and better assess their implications. That is, we gave ourselves time for the inevitable “unknown unknowns” of life — like the one that occurred last week, just to pick an entirely random example. And in fact, while they may appear jarring in the moment, temporary episodes like this offer a host of information and insight.\n\nIt is very possible that reserves are near, or approaching, their appropriate level — that it is, as the Philadelphia and New York Feds’ research noted it might be — on the higher end of our estimates. If that is the case, we may need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than anticipated.\n\nWe will continue to monitor and assess money market conditions, and act as necessary to ensure interest rate control. I think a central question is why the liquidity did not flow smoothly to where it was needed most.\n\nI’ll once again save you any suspense: I have more questions than answers. I think it’s important to avoid jumping to conclusions, and I certainly wouldn’t write any prescriptions — policy or otherwise — before we know what ailed the markets.\n\nIn the oft-used analogy of the money markets as plumbing, we should ask whether some pipes might be rusty. Or clogged. Or if more might be needed.\n\nIt is also worth asking if regulation might be contributing to any erosion or blockage that might exist.\n\nThe second question is whether the Fed ought to expand our toolkit. As many of you will have noted from the June FOMC minutes, there was a discussion about the possibility of a standing-repo facility. In theory, this could provide a backstop against unusual spikes in the federal funds and other money market rates. These discussions are in their infancy, and there is more work to be done, particularly in considering how such a facility would be designed, what its objectives would be, and what its net benefits would be relative to alternative approaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, I see three key takeaways from this interlude. First, in the face of unexpected turmoil, the Fed took swift and appropriate action, and it appears to be having the desired effect. Second, the element of surprise suggests some deeper issues may be at play. And third, that the Fed is committed to do what it takes to maintain interest rate control, and we will continue to keep a watchful eye.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome. I’m a big fan of bridging conversations across disciplines, so I want to applaud Larry and the team at the Consumer Finance Institute for pulling together such an eclectic — and esteemed — group of experts, including my old friend and former colleague, Colin Camerer.\n\nEconomics may be the dismal science, but it’s far from an exact one. And despite the myriad tools and equations at our disposal, there’s one remarkably unpredictable variable that forever complicates the results: human behavior. Neuroeconomics is relatively new territory, but it’s important to seek out new insights — in fact, we could use a little more of it. Given humanity’s inherently capricious nature, the more expertise and angles of analysis, the better. The richness of context it adds is more important now than ever, as the U.S. economy ventures into new territory: As AI and machine learning fundamentally alter the unfolding employment landscape; as a new economic normal takes hold, even as a record-long expansion continues; and as many of our traditional models and modes of assessment have begun to lose their predictive and evaluative prowess.\n\nI have a background in engineering, so it’s in my DNA to take a step back every once in a while and reassess structures: Do we have all the information we need? Are we still using the right models? Is there new analysis or insight that could make them more effective? And, crucially, do we know what we don’t know?\n\nI’m not saying we should throw out the old tools. But I do think we should contextualize them in the light of new information. And I do think it’s important to solicit information from outside traditional bounds.\n\nThe economy is not a fixed structure; it’s an ecosystem — a living, breathing organism informed by the people and entities that comprise it. As a policymaker, my judgment is influenced by the behaviors and patterns I see as much as by economic orthodoxy. And at a time when far more of the variables appear to be uncertain — or unruly — new insights are especially valuable to the discipline and study of economics.\n\nSo I’m very pleased that we could host this discussion today, and with that, let me turn the floor over to Bob Hunt.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Hello Stonier, and congratulations! It’s great to be in front of this group again. For those of you who don’t remember, I delivered the welcome address when you started this program three years ago. I certainly understand if you’ve forgotten because a lot has happened since June 2016. A lot.\n\nIn the intervening years, we’ve all had an education — you’ve mastered the intricacies of high-level banking management; I learned from a crash course in monetary policymaking; and we all finally, finally learned what it feels like to win a Super Bowl …\n\nSo I’m very pleased to bring this full circle and see you receive your diplomas.\n\nThe first order of business today is to give yourselves a round of applause. I like to do that because it’s important to recognize hard work, and because it guarantees people will clap at least once while I’m on stage.\n\nThe second order of business is another round of applause to the people whose support helped make this day happen … the friends, family, and faculty here today.\n\nFantastic! Now you’ve clapped twice while I was up here.\n\nThe third order of business is a few words about the importance of what you learned here at Stonier, and what it means when you apply it in the professional world.\n\nThe fourth is getting the actual diplomas, which is the most important, so I’ll keep the third part shortish.\n\nThe financial industry is only going to get more and more complicated and more and more complex, particularly in this current age of technological innovation. I say “current age” because of course, technology is always evolving and has already had several “ages,” as it will in the future.\n\nIn this iteration, financial institutions face challenges from cybersecurity to the rapid expansion of fintech.\n\nWe’re going to need people at the helm with an extraordinary set of skills, because financial institutions are important. And they’re always going to be important, because a financial system is fundamental to the human experience as we know it.\n\nI’m not saying that as some sort of consumerist rallying cry; it’s the simple fact of our existence. Financial systems have existed in some form across human history.\n\nFrom the barter system to banking, societies spanning time and space have found ways to execute the basic functions of payments, finance, and credit. It’s how we’ve amassed the things we need to live and the things we crave for comfort.\n\nFrom the central agora to apps on our phones, whether it’s a creditor’s note or a series of 1s and 0s, the essentials of the system have stood the test of time. Each individual system, of course, has not necessarily been so lucky.\n\nBut that’s important, too. Because just as history illustrates that we’ll always find our way back to those systems, it shows what it takes for those systems to last.\n\nIt takes trust.\n\nA financial system can only exist if we collectively agree to it. That takes an act of faith. A system of savings, credit, exchange, and investment only survives because we have trust in people we don’t know, currency we have no individual control over, payment systems with inner workings we can’t see, and institutions we grant power to — both to execute and to regulate those systems.\n\nAnd since a strong and sound economy can only exist when it’s underpinned by a strong and sound financial system, the people who run those institutions have a unique responsibility.\n\nSo, you know, no pressure.\n\nThat responsibility extends to institutions of all sizes. Bigger organizations can have impacts that resonate on a national or even global scale. Smaller ones, particularly community banks, can be a lifeline for a community, and are a necessity for small, local economies’ survival.\n\nOf course, you already know all this — I mean, you’re Stonier graduates, after all. But it’s a point worth repeating every once in a while, because that kind of responsibility doesn’t just require a mastery of balance sheets or investment acumen.\n\nIt calls for good leadership. And that’s something I know Stonier excels at.\n\nWhen I spoke to you three years ago, I mentioned the importance of character. A lot may have changed in the intervening years, but that hasn’t. I don’t think it ever will.\n\nThere’s a narrative — and, yes, sometimes a culture — in financial services that says cutthroat is king. I’ve spent a lot of my time as a Fed president talking to the banking community, and what I’ve seen and heard from them is the same thing I’ve seen in every other aspect of my career: The most respected leaders are honest, authentic, and trustworthy.\n\nSure, there are outliers; bad people can thrive, and flashes in the pan can last longer than they should. But eventually, those people get found out. And in the long run, the most important asset any of us has — and the one thing in life we can control — is our integrity.\n\nWe don’t usually have a say in what life throws at us, but we do decide how we handle it. Our financial system needs people at the top who can roll with those changes and make the right calls, even when they’re the hard ones.\n\nIn the end, the financial system exists to perform some pretty basic functions: It keeps savings safe; ensures that we can easily price, buy, and sell things; and helps us direct resources to their best advantage. But what that actually means in our day-to-day lives is pretty huge: It’s how we get an education, or put a roof over our families’ heads. It’s how we start a business, or invest in our kids’ future. It’s how we get sustenance and fulfillment. There’s a lot riding on it, and a lot riding on the people who run it.\n\nIt’s a big job. It’s going to take some Stonier grads to do it right.\n\nThank you, and congratulations to everyone again.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Hello, Class of 2019 — and congratulations!\n\nI want to talk to you today about resilience. About hard work and perseverance. About people who face challenges and overcome odds.\n\nYes, I’m talking about … me.\n\nSure, you guys have worked hard to get to graduation day, and this is an incredible moment for you.\n\nBut do you have any idea, the pressures of the commencement circuit?!\n\nI mean, you’re probably asking yourself right now, “Who is this guy? Man, I wish I’d graduated in 2015.” You know who gave the commencement address in 2015? Jon Bon Jovi.\n\nHow am I supposed to top that?\n\nI could focus on giving a great speech, but that’s a high bar, too.\n\nPractical advice? The “always wear sunscreen” speech already won that category.\n\nJokes? I’m a Fed president. I have to be very careful about what I say, especially anything political. So, there goes most of the material.\n\nPlus ... I’m a Fed president. We are constitutionally unfunny.\n\nThat leaves me with the only category of commencement speeches left: inspiration.\n\nThankfully, I have good material. Because all kidding aside, I do want to talk about resilience. But I want to talk about yours.\n\nI have all the facts and figures on the Class of 2019. But I also have a particular insight on Rutgers–Camden students because Chancellor Haddon is on the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors.\n\nWe spend part of those meetings getting feedback from our directors on their industries and sectors. And along with the updates on fiscal issues and education trends, Phoebe never fails to talk about her students. She never fails to emphasize just how hard you work, just how much of yourselves you put into your education, and just how much you give back to Camden.\n\nSo I could already infer a lot from what Google can tell me — this is an incredibly diverse student body that draws veteran, international, and first-generation students. You’re actively engaged with the city, and help make Rutgers–Camden an anchor institution. You’re out there working, getting real-life experience. But I also know what I hear from the person who sees you every day. And she confirms what I could infer: You are special.\n\nYou work hard. You live and study alongside people from totally different backgrounds. You’re out in the community, making a difference.\n\nAnd I know it’s not easy. Especially if you’re the first in the family to go to college. Especially if you’re in a brand new country. Especially if you’re coming back to school or returning from military service.\n\nThe word Phoebe uses most is “resilience.”\n\nWe’re in the middle of a long-overdue cultural conversation in this country about privilege. About the ways people are and aren’t afforded access. About how the accident of birth — who you’re born to, where you’re born, and what body you’re born into — can give you an artificial head start or unfairly put up roadblocks.\n\nBut I want you to know, whatever privilege you may or may not have, whatever hurdles are or aren’t in the way … that resilience you have? That’s an advantage that puts you 10 yards ahead of everyone else. That’s your superpower.\n\nThat resilience means you’ll survive disappointment, because it will come. And a lot of it will be even worse than having me as your commencement speaker when Colorado College got Oprah.\n\nThat resilience means you’ll know who you are — not every day, and not all the time, because life isn’t that simple. But it will center you in times of doubt, and it will always lead you back to yourself.\n\nThat resilience means you’ll experience more joy, and more fulfillment, because you’ll know how to see the true value of things. You’ll know substance means more than style and appreciate the small things in life — and you’ll understand that sometimes the little things aren’t little at all.\n\nThat resilience means you’ll speak up, and you’ll show up. It means you’ll be there for other people because you already know one of life’s most valuable lessons: No one does anything entirely on their own. It will give you the grace to share credit, and the humility to see others’ contributions.\n\nThat resilience makes you exceptional. Don’t ever doubt that, and don’t ever forget it.\n\nAnd I can’t wait for you to go out in the world and use your superpower. I can’t wait to see the good you do and the change you unleash.\n\nAnd when one of you is standing where I am today, giving the commencement address to another outstanding class of Rutgers–Camden graduates, I hope you’ll look back and take a few lessons from today:\n\nBe more famous than me — which shouldn’t be hard.\n\nTell better jokes than me — which should be easy.\n\nAnd if you can’t be famous, and you can’t be funny, be inspirational. Tell them how you used your superpower. Tell them how you changed the world. Because I know you will.

            "content": "Seeing the Forest for the Trees\n\nIt’s always a pleasure to be in Boston — such a pleasure, in fact, that I can even forget it’s Patriots territory. As an Eagles fan, I learned an interesting equation last year: The joy of winning is inversely proportionate to the frequency of winning. So it’s comforting to think that while Pats fans have probably already forgotten this year’s win, we’ll still be celebrating well into our 90s …\n\nSpeaking of celebrating, I want to wish a happy anniversary to Management Science for its 65 years. I was honored that David asked me to speak on the occasion, and very happy to oblige. What caught my attention in particular was the emphasis on integrating theory and practice, because they live on opposite ends of the spectrum far too often, and there’s not much use for a seemingly perfect model that crumbles under real-world conditions.\n\nI speak from experience. It’s happened to me more times than I care to remember. As a young civil engineer, designing what I thought was an indestructible bridge, only to see it collapse in the testing lab. As a not-so-young university president, watching the economy plummet in the wake of the financial crisis, taking our sublime three-year strategic plan with it. In a host of management positions, introducing structural change, only to find that the organism most resistant to change is an organization’s culture.\n\nSo I’m very pleased to have the opportunity to compare notes, and war stories, of theory gone wrong in practice.\n\nBefore I do, however, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAny time you’re dealing with complex structures — in engineering, in operations, in policy — it’s important to take a step back every once in a while to be sure you’re seeing the forest for the trees. And the more intricate the machine, the more necessary that reevaluation is. Because with so many interdependent parts — built on top of, or intertwined with, each other — there’s risk to the whole structure if one of those pieces isn’t working.\n\nSo it makes sense to kick the tires every now and again.\n\nOr, in the words of Bertrand Russell, “to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted.”\n\nIn the case of management science and operations research, I think the first principles we have to revisit are whether we’re using the right tools for the right jobs, and whether we’ve designed them with the right users in mind.\n\nThe Fallibility of Models\n\nThere are incredible opportunities from the advances we’re seeing in management decision-making — particularly when it’s enabled by technology — but there are downsides as well. That’s the case with any complex system, especially ones that are programmatic.\n\nTake fintech, where streamlined processes have expanded the opportunities for smaller loans, faster approvals, and greater market reach and penetration. But there’s a downside to algorithmic lending. Even in its early stages, we’re seeing discrimination in selection.\n\nI think the overall risk to any complex system, whether it’s technology based or not, lies in moving too far toward process and away from critical thinking.\n\nIn my experience, you run into trouble when you start thinking your model can do all the work.\n\nTo give a non-tech-based example: Every once in a while, a discussion pops up about shifting monetary policy to a rules-based regime, essentially advocating for the automation of the FOMC. That regime would put decisions on autopilot, without human intervention or judgment factoring into the equation. And while those rules are important, and inform a lot of our decisions, they shouldn’t be followed robotically.\n\nIt’s important to know what you don’t know. Complete control only works in a system where all the variables are known entities. One of my first engineering jobs was designing control systems for trains. That’s an operation that can be set on autopilot. We can control the trains. We can see the layout of the tracks. We know where they’ll be and when they’ll be there.\n\nIn other words, we know everything we need to know to keep them from running into each other.\n\nMonetary policy isn’t that precise. Despite some of the smartest thinkers and the best models, we can’t assign a degree of certainty to any of the variables.\n\nWe’re not 100 percent sure what inflation is. We can only estimate the natural rate of unemployment when it’s in the rearview mirror — and even then, we don’t universally agree. Productivity is notoriously difficult to measure, and that affects our understanding of GDP growth.\n\nTo operate monetary policy mechanically, we’d need a level of accuracy that just isn’t possible. We’d need a lot more data, a lot more frequently, with a lot more precision than the laws of economics allow.\n\nThe Taylor rule is an extraordinary contribution to the economics profession. But I wouldn’t get on a train that’s run by it.\n\nHumanity’s Competitive Edge\n\nMonetary policy should be more like a suspension bridge, with flexibility built into the design. It has a core structure, but it can bend to account for real-world events.\n\nOne of the reasons monetary policy can’t just be mechanized is that decisions have to be informed by human experience and past behavior — as in any discipline, models may work in theory, but not necessarily under the messy complication of real-life conditions.\n\nIf the Fed had followed the regime that some advocate, interest rates would have risen by several percentage points in the years following the Great Recession. Instead, models provided guidance, but people made the judgment — and wherever you place yourself on the ideological policy spectrum, I don’t think anyone would argue for high rates in a slow recovery.\n\nAt the heart of this is what can and can’t be mechanized. Some things just require human insight.\n\nAutomation in general has been the subject of a lot of conversation recently, particularly in the context of how it’s affecting the employment landscape. Whether it’s policy decisions, management models, or the workplace, the underlying lesson is the same: There are some things technology can’t do. The things that make us quintessentially human can’t be replicated or automated, because machines can’t think. Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data we input. Models are only as effective as we make them.\n\nSo looking at the future of management science, I think success lies in approaches that emphasize the human component as much as, if not more than, the programmatic.\n\nThat’s actually grounded in the profession’s genesis.\n\nOperations research was born of World War II, when the British and U.S. militaries tapped the scientific community for their expertise in processes, models, and analysis. There’s no question that deploying data analytics to the battlefield contributed to the Allied victory, whether through strategically allocating weaponry and resources, breaking codes, or building networks.\n\nIf there’s any area that’s subject to the unexpected, it’s the theater of war. And while adding the scientific, algorithmic component was crucial to success, so was human judgment.\n\nWhen the war ended, it seemed clear to researchers that the techniques could be beneficial in the civilian world, as companies and organizations grew larger and more complex, and the advent of the computer age was ushered in.\n\nWhen the journal launched 65 years ago, the discipline was still in its infancy, but it had undergone incredibly rapid development in the years after the war.\n\nThat era is often characterized by the popular culture of the time. And, in fact, 1954 was the year that Elvis recorded his debut album, On the Waterfront was in theaters, and families across the country tuned in to Father Knows Best. At its scheduled time — there were no commercial-free streaming plans — and on an actual television — which was roughly the size and weight of a small rhinoceros.\n\nThat all looks especially quaint from the vantage of 2019. But it was, in fact, a time of incredible change — socially, economically, and technologically — and the post-War boom fundamentally changed the business landscape. Which is likely what sped the development of management science as a discipline.\n\nOvercorrecting the Pendulum Swings\n\nWe’re in a similar situation now, as innovation in all sectors hits a rapid pace.\n\nAs a species, we tend to overreact to pendulum swings — sometimes to correct for them, and sometimes to keep pace with them. Technology has evolved so quickly that it’s become the default mode to digitize it if we can, without considering if we should.\n\nThe all-robot hotel in Japan comes to mind — not only could half the mechanized staff not perform their basic functions, the entire fleet was dependent on human assistance and maintenance.\n\nI should make clear that this isn’t a cranky, get-off-my-lawn rant about technology. I am wholly in favor of technological advancement and innovation. It’s fundamental to the American economy, and it’s something we do exceptionally well. It’s connected us to one another in a way that would’ve been unimaginable even a decade or two ago. It’s made life easier, and better, for the vast majority of people.\n\nWhat I am saying is that we should put it to its best use.\n\nOperations research deals with incredibly complex systems populated by incredibly complicated entities: human beings. Both the theory and the practice should take a step back, kick the tires, and be sure they’re using the right tools — technological or otherwise — for the right jobs.\n\nNow is a good time for that, because the overall race forward in technological capability is going to complicate the workplace even more. And in an increasingly tight labor market, it’s more important than ever to think about who, and how, organizations hire.\n\nAs technology advances, the underlying skills that make workers adaptable — the “soft skills” like creativity, communication, critical thinking — are going to be more important than a checklist. No single competence is going to survive that evolution.\n\nInstead, the best candidates will have a core set of skills that can evolve with the market, and we’ll likely see an overall shift to constant training and continuing education.\n\nExisting professionals will need continual upskilling, whether it’s to keep up with industry standards or just learn the office’s new software. People preparing for the workforce will need both proficiency in current programs and to develop skills that will help them adapt with the technology as it evolves.\n\nFrom the employers’ end, that means investing in the workforce and committing to lifelong learning. Simply replacing outdated skills with new ones just isn’t efficient or cost effective, and it may not even be enough — they’ll need workers who can adapt to a dynamic and regularly changing environment, and that means investing in people.\n\nThe End … or the Beginning?\n\nEducation institutions will also need to consider new models, not just because technology is forcing it, but because they’ll be in a position to offer the lifelong learning that workers need.\n\nThe changes happening in the workforce pose both opportunities and risks. On either side, it signals very interesting times coming our way.\n\nI think this time of increasing automation and computerization will only emphasize the importance of an array of skills, and add richness to the management science profession.\n\nAnd as we continue the research and execute the practice, I hope we’ll remember to take the odd step back, every once in a while, to hang that question mark on our assumptions. Just to be sure.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "It’s a pleasure to welcome everyone to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Fed speakers usually start off with a standard disclaimer that we’re speaking for ourselves, not for anyone else in the Fed System. But I’ll break that sacred vow to say on behalf of all my colleagues that we’re very pleased that you’re joining us today.\n\nWho says policymakers don’t live dangerously?\n\nI want to extend an extra thanks for being here, because I know a lot of people wondered what a discussion of monetary policy had to do with them. It’s a question our team heard more than once, and it’s a fair one.\n\nThere are two parts to the answer. First, you are the economy. The American economy is the biggest, most diverse on earth, but at its heart, it’s a collection of micro-economies made up of people and businesses and communities — it’s you and your neighbors. And you’re the people we conduct monetary policy for.\n\nSecond, we rely on feedback. Sure, we spend a lot of time looking at the myriad graphs and charts and alphabet soup of equations you’d expect. But the views and experiences of people and businesses across our communities are also crucial components of how we measure the health of the American economy.\n\nThose conversations are a regular part of how we collect and assess data. But this event is something different. It’s part of a larger listening tour that’s really about making sure we’ve got the right goals in place; that we’re still measuring the right things, and that the tools we use are still the best ones for the job.\n\nBefore I introduce our guest and get the afternoon underway, I want to take a moment to give the Fed primer to put these discussions in context.\n\nThe Federal Reserve can be a mysterious being. It’s a complex system used to doing its job out of the limelight, and it’s not just the average person on the street who would struggle to explain its various functions.\n\nWhen I first joined the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors, I was honestly surprised at how much about the Federal Reserve I didn’t know. So the Fed 101 is not because I think anyone here is lacking in general knowledge; it’s because I know from experience.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System\n\nSo first, the structure.\n\nAt the center is the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., which is what most people think of when they hear “The Fed.” The Board has seven governors’ seats, including Vice Chair Clarida, who’s joined us today and who is the driving force behind this listening tour.\n\nBut there are also the 12 District Banks around the country, including the one we’re in today, each an independent entity with its own president and board of directors.\n\nThe governors and presidents come together every six weeks or so in D.C. for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee — or FOMC — to discuss, and vote on, monetary policy. The governors and the president of the New York Fed are all permanent voters, while the rest of us rotate into position every few years. My first turn was in 2017, and I’ll be back in the saddle next year.\n\nOne of the things that surprised me most when I first got to the FOMC is that you honestly can’t tell who’s a voter and who’s not until the last 30 seconds of a two-day meeting. Everyone is equally involved in the debate and discussion. That’s an important detail, and it goes back to the way we’re organized.\n\nThe Fed’s structure is an outlier; you don’t see it in other countries, and it’s something I think of as uniquely American: a decentralized central bank. I also think it’s the key ingredient in making the best possible policy for the country.\n\nFirst and foremost, it gives vastly different communities a seat at the table and a voice in discussions.\n\nWe’re making monetary policy on a national level, and the size and scope of the U.S. economy can flatten the peaks and valleys we see in different areas. Seattle’s economic reality is vastly different than Camden’s, and the Fed’s unique structure makes sure we consider both.\n\nOur structure also helps to guard against groupthink. There’s an added richness to the discussions, because the people around the table have different backgrounds, different ways of looking at the data, and different priorities in economic outcomes. It’s true that we could be more diverse, and that’s something we’re working on. But even in our present state, there’s a multitude of opinion, and the wants and needs of incredibly varied constituencies are represented.\n\nHaving a federated system also adds to our overall independence. While the Fed was created by and is answerable to Congress, we’re an independent entity, which shields us from political pressure. That’s crucial to making good decisions. Monetary policy takes a while to work, and being free from outside influence allows us to make thoughtful, data-driven decisions about the medium term.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo that’s the form; what about the function?\n\nThe Fed is, of course, the nation’s central bank. We also regulate banks, process payments, conduct economic research, and work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies.\n\nDifferent banks also specialize in particular research areas: Dallas has expertise in energy, for instance, while New York is the go-to for financial markets. Here in Philadelphia, our focus is on consumer credit.\n\nAnd, the subject we’re here to discuss today: We set monetary policy to meet the goals laid out for us by Congress: maximum employment and price stability.\n\nIn their very simplest terms — with apologies to the economists in the room, who do not enjoy reducing things to their simplest terms — maximum employment means that if you’re looking for a job, you can find one relatively easily. That comes with some caveats, of course, including that it doesn’t necessarily mean the job you get will be the job you want. Price stability is low and stable inflation — enough for prices to grow at a healthy pace without devaluing the money in your bank account. Our current target is 2 percent.\n\nWhen we talk about monetary policy, it’s worth outlining not just what it can do, but what it can’t.\n\nMonetary policy isn’t all powerful. It’s a relatively limited set of fairly blunt tools, and it has a pretty narrow scope. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\n\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance — which is just policyspeak for telling people what to expect. But the majority of what we do is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\n\nI’m often asked about aspects of the American economy that affect our work, but that we don’t actually have any control over. Fiscal policy, for instance, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or things that take legislative action, like investments to encourage growth or programs to spur job creation.\n\nOur job is to create the conditions for a healthy economy to thrive. We till the land and make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the crops — take fiscal and other policy.\n\nSo if it’s limited, why are we here today?\n\nBecause those grounding conditions — maximum employment and price stability — are crucial, and we want to be sure our targets, processes, and tools are still the right ones. We want to be sure we’re thinking about policy the right way.\n\nPart of coming to that conclusion is hearing from you. How you’re experiencing the job market. How you’re feeling inflation. What challenges you’re seeing in your communities.\n\nBecause, again, you are the economy; you’re the reason we make policy in the first place.\n\nI want to turn it over now to Vice Chair Clarida, who, as I mentioned, is the driving force behind these listening sessions.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you; it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nThe tagline of this conference is Global Trade: Darkening Clouds or New Beginnings? And I want you to know that I valiantly resisted the temptation to make a bad joke — or worse, a pun — involving Churchill’s “beginning of the end” or “end of the beginning.” But there are some echoes of its essence in the subject of my remarks today. Life — and policy — is full of endings and beginnings that are part of a larger whole. So I’d like to talk today about the continuing process of normalizing monetary policy, and the unwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet. If I were going to give in to the urge to make that joke, I might call it the beginning of the end of the middle of the end of the almost end of our road to normal. … But, of course, I would never do that.\n\nI will, however, add to my remarks a brief outlook on how I see the economy unfolding and what that means for my policy views. I’m approaching my four-year anniversary as a Fed president, and one of the first lessons I learned on taking that seat was to always give an economic outlook. Another was to always preface any remarks with the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOutlook\n\nStarting with GDP, the initial readings of Q1 were a pleasant surprise, particularly as first quarters have tended to be slow in recent years. However, there are a few caveats. A good chunk of that boost came from inventories and net exports, which are unlikely to carry into the rest of the year. It’s possible that the drag we usually see in first quarters will show up in Q2 this year, as inventories in particular tend to counter large boosts today with a drag tomorrow. Consumer spending, which has been the primary driver of growth, showed a slowdown from last year, as did business investment.\n\nThe net result of these components means my outlook for growth this year remains the same for now: a little above 2 percent. I also continue to see next year returning to trend, at about 2 percent.\n\nThe labor market continues to show remarkable strength, with strong job creation and continued low unemployment. I think the unemployment rate could move down even further, to 3.5 percent before edging back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nInflation has softened in recent months, and it’s an area I’m focusing my attention on. I haven’t yet revised my medium-term inflation forecast, because I suspect some of the recent weakness is transitory. So I still see it running slightly above our 2 percent target for the medium term, but that projection is nowhere near written in stone; more like a dry-erase board.\n\nIf any component of the outlook were to affect my view on the appropriate path of monetary policy, it would be inflation. However, we’re not there yet, and it would take more data to convince me. I therefore continue to see one increase at most this year; possibly one, at most, next.\n\nUnwinding the Balance Sheet\n\nTurning to the crux of my remarks today, as you know, the FOMC has made further moves regarding the balance sheet, which were laid out in its updates to the “normalization principles and plans” after our January and March meetings. There are three interrelated components to this. First, continued implementation of monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves. Second, our intent to stop asset redemptions in September. And third, the anticipation that the size of the balance sheet will be constant for some time after that, letting the supply of reserves decline, very gradually, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow.\n\nTo clarify the Fed-speak, “monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves” means that policy will be executed as it is in normal times, with the federal funds rate acting as our primary tool. The fed funds, along with other short-term rates, will be managed mainly via administered rates, such as interest on reserves.\n\n“Amplitude,” of course, can sound quite nebulous, but in the case of the fed funds market, “an ample supply of reserves” has a specific meaning: a level of aggregate reserves that can comfortably accommodate demand within our target range through all the volatility associated with seasonal demand and autonomous factors, without requiring active management. This means that, as long as economic and financial conditions unfold more or less as we expect them to, the balance sheet will remain largely on autopilot, left in the background, as boring as ever. While the current state of reserves certainly falls within that definition, the Committee has also made clear that we ultimately intend to hold no more reserves than necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy. I’m going to revisit that expression quite a few times, so it’s probably best if everyone adds mental quotation marks around “no more than necessary” and “efficient and effective” — I promise it reflects my adherence to careful policy wording, rather than a lack of imagination. Or a thesaurus.\n\nAs we’ve announced, our plan is to end the balance sheet runoff in September. Starting this month, the cap on Treasury redemptions will be lowered from $30 billion a month to $15 billion, to put a modest damper on the pace of redemptions.\n\nWhen the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be somewhat more than necessary for that “efficient and effective” execution, rather than no more than necessary. Therefore, we intend to hold the size of the balance sheet roughly constant for a time. By doing so, we will let the supply of reserves decline gradually with growth in currency and other non-reserve liabilities.\n\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and that uncertainty calls for a cautious approach. It may be that “ample” is more than we thought, and reserve levels can’t really drop much further without inflicting interest rate volatility and creating liquidity-management issues for financial institutions.\n\nAdditionally, the supply of reserves is notoriously volatile. Autonomous factors, such as the Treasury General Account and repo facilities, can move the aggregate supply of reserves by as much as $90 billion in either direction in a single week. We have a good track record of forecasting these swings, and they do tend to reverse themselves. But those factors do inflict a substantial fluctuation in the supply of reserves to depository institutions.\n\nSo in metaphorical terms, it is a dark and stormy night, to quote Peanuts, and we are walking in the direction of a wall. In that situation, most of us would give the advice of “walk, don’t run,” and keep a bit of distance from where we think the wall is.\n\nWalk, Don’t Run\n\nSo we intend to walk toward the “efficient and effective” level, rather than charging at full speed.\n\nThe plan is to slow down the pace of decline in average reserves. We’ll do that by keeping the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a time. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time. Average currency growth rarely exceeds $10 billion per month, while asset redemptions have averaged more than $30 billion a month. That said, more than half of the decline realized to date was unrelated to asset redemptions, and reserves have declined by more than $1 trillion since their peak of $2.8 trillion.\n\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia staff,1 is not only the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset redemptions. In fact, it effectively decouples asset and liability policies as we make our way to “no more than necessary.” It also gives us additional time for monitoring and analysis, and may even foster changes to how financial institutions manage liquidity. These factors both meet the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in a “gradual and predictable manner.”\n\nKeeping the Distance\n\nWe also want to keep a comfortable distance to avoid a collision with the wall. As I said, we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and the parameters of “ample” may be closer than we think. Those autonomous factors I mentioned add something of a howling wind to our metaphorical late-night excursion, because their volatile effect makes it similarly difficult to navigate a narrow path for aggregate reserves. Both considerations call for additional aggregate reserves, creating a buffer zone to account for margins of error in our estimates and protect against large swings in autonomous factors.\n\nA Little More Normalizing\n\nAs reserves continue to decline, they will eventually reach their efficient and effective level, at which point we’ll resume asset purchases to maintain that level, keeping up with nominal growth.\n\nEven at that point, though, we will not be “normalization accomplished” — though we will be normalization adjacent.\n\nBecause the next natural step in the balance sheet discussion is its composition.\n\nOnce the balance sheet’s holdings do not exceed the need, they’re unlikely to meet the want — at least not that of the long run. The FOMC has made clear that the portfolio will consist primarily of Treasuries, but currently, MBS account for more than 40 percent. There are no Treasury bills, and our Treasury holdings have a substantially longer remaining maturity than outstanding Treasury securities. While a significant number of Treasuries will reach maturity in the coming years, a sizable share has a remaining lifetime of 20 years or more.\n\nAs we discuss the question of composition, it’s worth returning to the Rosetta Stone of policyspeak, particularly when we talk about the “longer run.” The transition could easily take close to a decade, even if economic and financial conditions unfold as expected. Balance sheet policies are inherently asymmetrical — that is, they are deployed when we need more accommodation than rates alone can deliver, never the other way around — so the portfolio composition will never average “normal” nor, in fact, will it be “normal” on anything like a regular basis.\n\nWhile the longer run can be something of an amorphous concept, the near term is more concrete, and poses pressing questions. There will need to be decisions about how to distribute reinvestments and, eventually, outright asset purchases. Importantly, those decisions can have an immediate impact, and will need to be communicated clearly, as they will almost certainly be the subject of intense market attention.\n\nI’m not going to weigh in on the functions, but I will say something about the philosophy.\n\nFor me, any discussion of composition has to be predicated on a set of grounding principles. While there are certainly more than just these two to consider, I would start with the doctrines of neutrality and flexibility.\n\nNeutrality is grounded in the monetary policymaker’s Hippocratic Oath of doing no harm. In this case, our plans should avoid market disruptions. One way to do that is ensuring we spread holdings and purchases across maturities in proportion to their amount outstanding, avoiding cornering any one particular issue. In particular, recently issued Treasuries — often referred to as “on the run” — are vital to market functioning.\n\nFlexibility involves the crucial ability to dip into our arsenal of balance sheet policies if the need arises. I want to stress that we would only revisit those options if we again found ourselves in a situation that called for more accommodation than the federal funds rate could provide on its own. But it is important to maintain that ability. One way to increase flexibility is by changing the maturity of the balance sheet’s composition. The shorter the duration of the portfolio, the larger the flow of maturing proceeds at any given time. That flow can be redirected, allowing for a swift change in the composition without expanding the balance sheet or having to sell assets outright.\n\nOne option, therefore, would be tilting the Treasury portfolio toward a somewhat shorter term. That could be done by simply increasing our holdings of Treasury bills, which have a maturity of a year or less.\n\nIt’s important to note that there are many discussions still to be had, and that these principles are but two of many. Important ones, but in good company.\n\nFinally, it is worth repeating that the normalization process, while an important policy decision, is not indicative of our monetary policy stance.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnd so I come to the beginning of the end of my remarks.\n\nWe are on the path to normalization, though when this next step is complete, there will still be more to take. The conversations will continue, particularly about composition, and for me, the principles of neutrality and flexibility will be key.\n\nWith that, the end of my remarks and the beginning of the Q&A.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n[1]I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.",

            "content": "Before I begin, I’d like to do two things.\n\nFirst, I want to congratulate the Chamber on its centennial year — happy anniversary.\n\nSecond, I want to address the elephant in the room. It might be better to avoid such a divisive subject in these polarized times, but I think it’s better to face controversy head-on. So I venture in, bravely posing the question: Is Vineland the dandelion capital of the country or the egg capital?\n\nThis has been a subject of internal debate at the Philadelphia Fed for weeks now, and Wikipedia supports both camps.\n\nSo please, by a show of hands, help us start the healing: dandelion or egg?\n\nNow that that’s settled, I’ll turn to something almost as important: the economy.\n\nAt an event like this, I’d normally give an economic update and discuss what that means for my policy outlook, and I intend to do that. But I’ve also been asked to give a Fed primer for anyone who’s not 100 percent familiar with the history and functions of the Federal Reserve. If you count yourself among them, you’re in very good company. It can be a byzantine and complicated system, and I remember being surprised, as a newly minted member of the board of directors, at the scope of the Fed’s work — it’s more than just interest rates.\n\nWith that in mind, I’ll give a quick intro to how the Federal Reserve came to be and what it is we do, then give the requisite outlook with some added context.\n\nAnd I will start with the most important aspect of Fed history and tradition, which is the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System\n\nWith that done, a brief history. It’s probably safe to say that a central bank like the Federal Reserve could only happen in America. That’s because its structure reflects a deep and long-standing battle of ideological wills that are foundational to our national existence.\n\nThe Fed has only existed for a little over a century. Compare that with the Bank of England, which has been around since 1694, or the Riksbank, Sweden’s national bank, which was established a few decades before that. Of course, those were sovereign nations much earlier than we were, but the Federal Reserve Act was passed in 1913 — not exactly the dawn of the republic. So why is that?\n\nWithout going too far down the historical rabbit hole, there were, in fact, attempts — and successes — at central banking in the United States before the Fed. But their rise and fall reflected those competing ideological forces: On one side were those who wanted the stability and economic advantage wrought by a central bank, while the other housed those who fundamentally distrusted centralized power. This was at the heart of our founding: Federalism and Republicanism. Hamilton and Jefferson. Dandelion and egg.\n\nBefore the 20th century, we had two real central banking successes — both in Philadelphia, by the way — which we imaginatively refer to as the First and Second Banks of the United States. Both had 20-year charters when they were established, and both faced political climates that were hostile to their renewal when the time came — which meant both were left to expire.\n\nThat philosophical tension never went away. But in the late 1800s, a series of booms and busts culminated in the Panic of 1907, and the need for a central bank became clear. The Federal Reserve was born.\n\nAgain, I will spare you the extensive details, but the important part is the result: a decentralized central bank. A compromise between those two underpinning viewpoints.\n\nAt its center is the Board of Governors in Washington D.C., which is where the Chair sits and is what most people think of when they hear “The Fed.” But there are also 12 District Banks around the country, each an independent entity with its own president and board of directors. People often ask what it’s like to work for Jay Powell, or Janet Yellen before him. But the thing is, I don’t. I work for our board and our District.\n\nThat unique Fed structure gives us a better view of the realities on the ground — the United States is a vast and complicated economic machine, but it is fundamentally made up of a collection of micro-economies across the cities, towns, and communities that blanket the country.\n\nThe regional Banks bring the viewpoints of our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate monetary policy, which we do roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. Again, that local perspective is crucial, because we’re making policy at a national level, and the size and scope of the U.S. economy can flatten the peaks and valleys we see in different areas.\n\nIn those meetings, we discuss monetary policy and, at the end, we vote. The governors are permanently in a voting position, as is the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate in — I’m up in 2020, and despite the fact that you’d never know who’s in rotation until the last 30 seconds of a two-day meeting, people will be a lot more interested in what I have to say come January …\n\nCongress outlined a “dual mandate” of price stability and maximum employment for the Federal Reserve, which is again unusual for central banks, most of which focus solely on inflation. The Fed also regulates banks, processes payments, and conducts economic research.\n\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work to help strengthen our local economies. As I said, each of the Banks are independent entities, which means we have the freedom to tailor our work to our own area’s needs. While all Feds have a community development function, each of us executes it in a different way. At the Philadelphia Fed, we’ve created the Economic Growth & Mobility Project (EGMP), which focuses on what we think are the three foundational aspects of economic mobility: job creation — that is, stable, well-paid jobs that lead to financial security; workforce development — that is, education and training for people to get those jobs; and infrastructure, which includes everything from housing to transportation to broadband.\n\nThe Fed can’t make grants or finance projects; it’s not in our congressional remit. What we can do is bring people together and offer sound research. So with the EGMP, we’re forming partnerships around our District to help address systemic issues in what we call Research in Action Labs.\n\nThe first of those was in northeastern Pennsylvania, where they did have one of those three pillars — a lot of jobs at fulfillment centers — but were struggling with another: infrastructure. Those centers are located outside of town, and the region was built like most of America in the latter half of the 20th century: constructed to bring commuters from the suburbs and outskirts into the city, not the other way around. So we worked with local partners, and they came up with a collective set of solutions that worked for them — launching pilot programs, establishing a council on equitable transit, and making transportation a priority in the area.\n\nThat part is crucial: The Fed can offer research, data, and support, but communities are the ones that understand their own unique needs. Our job is to offer our research and convening power, and to share projects’ data and results with anyone who might benefit. We’ve already heard from communities that have issues similar to northeastern Pennsylvania, asking how they can do something similar. Now that we’ve helped with the program, we can share a blueprint.\n\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a lot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In Philadelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\n\nSo that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n\nFor instance, we use our research to share our economic outlooks.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nTurning to the first part of our mandate, “maximum employment” means, more or less, that if you’re looking for a job, you can find one relatively easily. That comes with some caveats, including that it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll find the job you want, and, obviously, this is nowhere near a technical term. In fact, somewhere, a cold shiver just ran down an economist’s spine … But by a colloquial measure, that’s what we mean.\n\nThe unemployment rate will never be zero. People naturally leave jobs and come in and out of the labor force, and we expect some level of unemployment to reflect that. We think about a sort of happy medium, where jobs are available but not so abundant that it starts to put upward pressure on inflation; we refer to this as the “natural rate” of unemployment. It’s important to note that the natural rate is elusive – it’s more easily evaluated in the rearview mirror, and even then it’s not concrete enough for consensus, but we do have estimates. Most economists currently put that measure somewhere around 4½ percent. So by contrast, the current unemployment rate of 3.8 percent is relatively low. I actually see that rate moving further down this year — somewhere around the 3½ percent range — before edging back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nJob creation is another metric that garners a lot of attention, and the last two months’ data definitely made a few headlines. February’s initial number made headlines at 20,000 — though it’s now been revised up to 33,000 — because it was much lower than expected, and much, much lower than other months. March, on the other hand, was a robust 190,000 — which has been more or less the average number over the last half-year or so.\n\nThese numbers illustrate the persistent Fed mantra of data dependency. First, it’s important to take a medium-term view, and not let one report or data series derail an outlook. Second, the dismal science is not exact. If you look at economic predictions from a year or two ago, a lot of them had job creation slowing significantly by now — my own included. But the labor market has shown remarkable strength, and its continued tightening has surprised a lot of experts. So it’s important to be patient as the data roll in, and not jump to conclusions on the basis of one round — or even a generally agreed-upon prediction. We want the data to confirm it.\n\nTurning to price stability, the Fed has a goal of 2 percent inflation. That’s enough for the economy to grow at a healthy pace without price changes causing discernable friction in the economy.\n\nAfter several years of running persistently below our preferred 2 percent target, inflation finally started running about that rate. In recent months, it’s edged back down somewhat.\n\nI see inflation averaging slightly higher than 2 percent this year and next. Again, my focus is on the medium-term average, and what I’m watching in particular is inflation’s trajectory — that is, not just its direction, but the speed at which it travels.\n\nAs with all things policy related, I’ll be driven by the data. In particular, I’m giving weight to core inflation for a better view of the fundamentals, as fluctuations in energy prices are likely to affect the headline metric.\n\nTurning finally to GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for 2019, and around 2 percent next year, which I see as trend.\n\nThat number is disappointing to a lot of people. But it’s important to remember that we’re on track for the longest economic expansion on record, and it’s coming in the context of very low unemployment and low and stable inflation. In that setting, continued steady growth is not what I’d call “disappointing.”\n\nThere are, of course, some risks to watch for, and I’m keeping an eye on global developments, growth abroad, and trade.\n\nAnother risk that’s been discussed is the yield curve, a part of which inverted last month. Again, a primer for the uninitiated. The yield curve shows the difference between the return on bonds with various lifespans — in general, shorter-term bonds tend to have lower returns while the longer terms yield more. Economists refer to the premium on short-maturity Treasuries as “the money premium,” reflecting the idea that they have many of the features of money. The normal shorthand would be to say that they’re more liquid than long-term securities, but that money-like quality is something that investors are willing to pay for in the form of lower returns.\n\nSo normally, there is an upward tilt to the yield curve. Long-term rates reflect expectations of future short-term rates; so if long-term rates fall below current short-term rates, it signals a market expectation that future rates will likely be lower than they are now — which happens when the economy gets weak and policymakers respond.\n\nTry saying that last sentence five times fast.\n\nWith the yield curve discussion laid out, there are some mitigating factors to consider, because we’re looking at a very different economic playing field than we have in the past. The Fed’s balance sheet is still historically large, which may be affecting long-term yields. And while inversions in the yield curve do appear to have a relationship with downturns, correlation does not equal causation, and that inversion is not an absolute predictor.\n\nUltimately, my views are shaped by multiple indicators, and there are certainly aspects of the economy — the strength of the labor market, for instance — that point to a fundamentally sound U.S. economy.\n\nAccounting for all those factors — a strong labor market, muted inflation, sustained moderate growth, and the penumbra of uncertainty — I continue to be in wait-and-see mode, and my outlook for rates remains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet\n\nI just mentioned the Fed’s balance sheet, which is yet another aspect of Fed policy and action that has captured attention lately, and the last issue I’ll touch on before we head into Q&A.\n\nI want to start by saying that while the balance sheet is an important part of the policy discussion, it’s not indicative of our monetary policy stance.\n\nA final primer, this one on the balance sheet: In the wake of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession, the Fed turned to what we call “unconventional” monetary policy.\n\nOur conventional means of conducting monetary policy is the federal funds rate. Lower rates can encourage economic activity while higher rates can help prevent overheating. But in 2008, the economy was severely damaged, and when the Fed lowered rates to essentially zero, it still needed help. We had to go beyond our usual toolkit and turned to large-scale asset purchases, which was a program better known as quantitative easing, or QE. QE involved buying assets on a larger scale and venturing into longer-term Treasuries along with mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. After three rounds of QE, the balance sheet — which was roughly $900 billion before the crisis — had swelled to $4.5 trillion.\n\nIn late 2014, we stopped the purchases, and kept the balance sheet constant by reinvesting the proceeds as they came to maturity. A year later, the FOMC voted for the first modest rate hike, signaling the first baby steps toward normalization. After three more increases to the federal funds rate, the FOMC was ready to start looking at bringing the balance sheet into the normalization process, voting in September of 2017 to start the unwinding process the following month.\n\nAt that point, the size of the balance sheet was larger than we’d ever seen, and the MBS in particular rendered its makeup different than it was before the crisis: Assets were made up primarily of those Treasuries and MBS, while the liability side overwhelmingly consisted of paper currency and bank reserves and balances.\n\nThe means of unwinding the balance sheet were straightforward: We could either stop reinvesting the securities as they come to maturity or sell them on the open market. We opted for the former, with gradually increasing caps on the amounts that were not redeemed. This helped us attain the gradual, predictable, and thoroughly boring process that we’re aiming for.\n\nWhich brings us to 2019. At the March FOMC meeting, we said that we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September. Once we do so, we’ll reinvest paydowns from MBS — subject to a cap of $20 billion per month — into Treasuries, which reflects our long-standing plans to hold primarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\n\nThat won’t quite be the end of normalization, however. In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be slightly higher than what we need to “efficiently and effectively” implement monetary policy, and our ultimate goal for reserves is “no more than necessary.”\n\nOur plan is to keep the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for some time after September. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\n\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, which means we should approach the “efficient and effective” level with caution.\n\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia Fed staff,1 is not only the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset redemptions, and proceeds in the FOMC’s preferred “gradual and predictable manner.”\n\nFinally, I want to note that balance sheet normalization has received a lot of attention both in our meetings and communications, and will continue to do so. Again, while that does reflect its importance, it does not reflect our current monetary policy stance. We often refer to the FOMC’s “toolkit” when discussing policy options. Balance sheet policy certainly remains an option, but we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s reach, but out of sight for now.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat, in the smallest nutshell possible, is the combination overview of the Fed’s purposes and functions and my economic outlook as it stands today. Instead of going on any further, I’m going to stop there to turn it over to you for questions, and again, wish the Chamber a happy 100th birthday — you don’t look a day over 85.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n[1]I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.",

            "content": "Almost exactly a year ago, I was addressing the New York chapter of NABE in Midtown Manhattan. And it strikes me that, much like show business and politics, a year is a long time in economics, but there are, in fact, some strong similarities between now and then: Both components of the Fed’s dual mandate are in good health, my outlook is fairly positive, and I’m standing in front of a group of business economists. Although the commute was much shorter this time.\n\nI’ve therefore been thinking a lot about the topic I addressed at that event, which is perhaps even more relevant today. Because, of course, while some aspects of the landscape have stayed the same, many others have changed.\n\nSo with your indulgence, I’d like to revisit that subject and discuss the continued decline of business dynamism in the American economy. Some new research out of the Philadelphia Fed adds an interesting dimension, and it’s something I know business economists are thinking about right now.\n\nBefore I get to that, however, I’ll start with an economic outlook and preface my thoughts with the one thing that never changes: the standard Fed disclaimer … The views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLabor Market\n\nTurning first to employment, the labor market continues to show sustained strength. February’s jobs numbers were significantly lower than both market forecasts and previous months. However, it would be a mistake to allow one month’s data to obscure the robust growth and continued tightening of the past several years. In fact, I always caution that a single data series or report should not, on its own, derail an outlook; we look at that information in context, and the Fed’s mantra of “data driven” means thinking about how things unfold in the medium term.\n\nFor the past half-year, job creation has averaged 190,000 a month — showing stamina that has, frankly, surprised many of us. At some point, the number of net new jobs will necessarily fall, but even then, it should not be taken as a harbinger of economic doom. Somewhere around 100,000 a month will be more than sufficient to keep up with growth in the labor force.\n\nAnother metric that’s surpassed expectations is the number of people coming off the sidelines, which is showing up in the data in various ways: In the instances that the unemployment rate ticked slightly upward in recent months, for example, it has been reflective of more people coming into the labor force.\n\nAll in all, I see a strong labor market, with unemployment continuing to move down, likely reaching a basement in the 3½ percent range this year before ticking back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nInflation\n\nAfter several years of running persistently below our preferred 2 percent target, inflation finally started running about that rate. In recent months, it’s edged back down somewhat.\n\nI see inflation averaging slightly higher than 2 percent this year and next, which is not out of line with how I view our target. Running a little higher after such a long period of underperformance is not, in my mind, a red flag. The Fed has a symmetrical target, which means I’m equally concerned about persistently low inflation as I would be about its opposite.\n\nAgain, my focus is on the medium term average, and what I’m watching in particular is inflation’s trajectory — that is, not just its direction, but the speed at which it travels.\n\nAs with all things policy related, I’ll be driven by the data. In particular, I’m giving weight to core inflation for a better view of the fundamentals, as fluctuations in energy prices are likely to affect the headline metric.\n\nGDP\n\nTurning to GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent some time in 2020.\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion in recent days and weeks of what some call “disappointing” growth projections such as my own. When advance estimates for Q1 GDP are issued in a few weeks, those voices will likely be amplified: I expect Q1 of 2019 to come in around 1.5 percent. This actually reflects a pattern of several years’ running, in which first quarters have consistently seen low or negative growth. However, those have balanced out when the following quarters pick up steam, which is what I foresee for 2019. Overall, it’s important to remember that we are still looking at continued economic growth, and are on pace for the longest economic expansion in our history. That doesn’t fall into the category of “disappointing” for me.\n\nI also do not think the growth forecast should be entirely surprising, since it reflects well-documented structural forces, rather than transitory ones. The impact of demographics, for instance, has been central to discussions of labor force participation in recent years, and that impact, in turn, has played a part in the continued slowing of productivity.\n\nOutlook and Policy Decisions\n\nI still see the outlook as a net positive. That said, there are some risks I’m paying close attention to. First, although household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace, businesses report increasing uncertainty and decreasing confidence, dampening the investment outlook somewhat. Second, global factors continue to hold my attention, including growth forecasts abroad and trade developments.\n\nAnd, of course, there is the renewed concern about the yield curve. While it has often been the case that inversions in the yield curve have preceded downturns, a couple of points bear mention, particularly because they offer some assurance.\n\nFirst, as we all learned in econ classes, correlation does not equal causation, and while there appears to be a relationship between yield curve inversions and recessions, it’s not a foolproof indicator. Second, the playing field is different this time around. The Fed’s balance sheet is still historically large — something I’ll touch on in a moment — which may be influencing long-term yields.\n\nUltimately, my views are shaped by multiple indicators, and there are certainly aspects of the economy — the strength of the labor market, for instance — that point to a fundamentally sound U.S. economy.\n\nAccounting for all those factors — a strong labor market, muted inflation, sustained moderate growth, and the penumbra of uncertainty — I continue to be in wait-and-see mode, and my outlook for rates remains, at most, one hike for 2019 and one for 2020.\n\nI will add here that much has been made of the FOMC’s use of “patience” in discussing the future path of monetary policy. I agree that patience is necessary and would, in fact, draw in other of the Seven Virtues: Temperance guiding a moderated and thoughtful response to accumulated data; Diligence in watching and evaluating that data; and, of course, Humility, in knowing that as and when those data indicate, we are ready and willing to change our outlooks in accordance.\n\nI ask for Charity only from audiences who think I’m being long-winded …\n\nBefore I turn to the subject for today, I do want to visit the topic of the balance sheet, as promised. My opening caveat here is that, while the balance sheet is clearly part of the discussion of monetary policy, it is not currently indicative of our monetary policy stance.\n\nAs noted after the March FOMC meeting, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September, resuming the reinvestment of all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, subject to a cap of $20 billion per month, will be reinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold primarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\n\nThis will not quite be the end of normalization. In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be somewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy, and our ultimate goal for reserves is “no more than necessary.”\n\nWe intend to keep the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for some time after the September end to runoffs. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\n\nFor me, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, which means we should approach the “efficient and effective” level with caution.\n\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia Fed staff,1 is not only the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset redemptions, and proceeds in the FOMC’s preferred “gradual and predictable manner.”\n\nSince we started unwinding in October of 2017, we stressed that the process would be entirely mundane — the balance sheet was put essentially on autopilot and moved to the background. Boredom may not be a virtue, though we might invoke Continence in its place. And it was, in fact, entirely unremarkable — and unremarked upon — until earlier this year. While there will likely be continued discussion, particularly about composition, I do believe it will — and should — be entirely excitement-free.\n\nIn the vernacular of the FOMC’s “toolkit” as we often refer to it: Balance sheet policy certainly remains an option should we need it — that is, should we again see a situation in which the federal funds rate alone cannot provide sufficient accommodation. But we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s reach, but out of sight for now.\n\nBusiness Dynamism\n\nThis brings me, somewhat meanderingly, to the subject I want to address.\n\nThe U.S. economy has historically been characterized by an elevated level of dynamism. For the uninitiated, the U.S. is certainly “dynamic” in the colloquial sense of being innovative and imaginative, but in this case, “dynamism” refers to the economic measure that is defined by turnover: New businesses enter the market and others leave, workers move from job to job, and people come in and out of the workforce.\n\nThis perpetual churn makes resources more fluid. Labor and capital are freed to flow from the least to the most productive firms, and productivity, wages, and overall economic growth increase.\n\nOver the past three decades or so, dynamism has been in decline. In particular, the data show lower business start-up activity, slowing labor reallocation, and much less worker mobility. During much of that time — roughly the past 20 years — there’s also been a drop in productivity growth.\n\nWe don’t know the strength of the relationship between these two, or, indeed, if there is one. But these and other economic trends raise interesting possibilities and points for consideration.\n\nDynamism in Decline\n\nTo set the stage, we can see the decline in both dynamism and entrepreneurship since the early 1980s in a variety of measures.\n\nOn the firm side, the new start-up rate has deteriorated by close to 40 percent, while the exit rate has been more or less flat.2 The result is a net start-up rate that has not just slowed, but has moved into negative territory.\n\nI know this runs completely counter to intuition. For most of us, that time is inextricably linked to start-up culture. That’s when companies that would eventually become giants started with a couple of people in a garage. That’s when the landscape of business was changed by the dot-com boom — and saw its subsequent bust — then rebounded to fundamentally alter the way we communicate and generated a world of tech start-ups and angel investors. But activity in start-ups reaches far wider than technology, and entrepreneurship is not confined to Silicon Valley. We’re also talking about mom-and-pop shops and local small businesses.\n\nThe IPO rate — a measure that has been linked to encouraging entrepreneurship and start-up activity — is also falling, while M&A activity has been strong, particularly over the past decade. The end result here is that industries are becoming increasingly concentrated, and the average listed company is bigger, older, and more profitable.3\n\nOn the worker side, people are now more likely to be employed at large, mature firms and are much less mobile than they used to be.\n\nThe share of employment at smaller and medium-sized younger firms has fallen from about 20 percent to 10 percent in the past few decades, while the proportion of workers at larger, older firms has risen from about 40 percent to 50 percent.4\n\nThe rate of job reallocation is falling as well — that is, the number of jobs added to and subtracted from the economy. We think of this churn as a central feature of the U.S. labor market, but the reallocation rate has actually fallen by about 22 percent since the early ’90s.5\n\nWorkers are also much less mobile than they used to be. People aren’t moving for work the way they used to, and when they do, they don’t go as far. The rate of people moving out of state has dropped to less than half the average level we saw in the quarter century that followed the Second World War.6\n\nThe Impact of Dynamism\n\nWhile the data clearly point to a decline in turnover and dynamism, there’s a logical argument that asks, “So what?” Isn’t it possible that this is the natural state of an economy settling into middle age? What’s wrong with older, bigger, more profitable firms hiring people who stay around longer?\n\nThe very short answer is: innovation and jobs — in the case of the latter, both the number and the quality.\n\nTaking those in turn, innovation intensity is more common in younger, smaller firms. Smaller companies spend more on R&D as a proportion of sales, and research shows that the quality of innovation — as measured by patent citations — is inversely proportionate to firm size.7 Older, more staid organizations achieve productivity growth from entering and exiting markets, or from expanding and contracting their physical presence, like offices or factories. A significant portion of industry-level growth in manufacturing, for instance, is achieved this way.\n\nHigh productivity firms also grow faster, contributing to overall productivity growth.\n\nNew firms additionally provide job opportunities. That’s not to say that older firms don’t produce jobs — generally through continued growth, acquisition, and consolidation across industries. But fast-growing businesses, which tend to be young, have historically accounted for a substantial portion of job creation, averaging about 70 percent of gross annual job creation in the decades spanning 1992–2011.8 And overall, more fluid labor markets ease the path up the job ladder, allow workers to find better matches for their skills, and can encourage attachment to the labor force.\n\nThe Culprits\n\nThe fact that dynamism has slowed suggests that there has been some fundamental change in the economy.\n\nOne theory is that regulatory burden is discouraging new start-ups. And while it is true that regulation has generally increased in the U.S., that pace has not been constant or consistent across industries. We can, therefore, compare industry dynamism with industry regulation and get a sense of whether there’s any correlation. The evidence so far indicates that the case is fairly weak, and where it does exist, it actually goes in the opposite direction.9 The same holds true for start-up rates.\n\nAnother possibility is that it’s simply too expensive to start a new business. However, if the fixed cost of starting a new business had risen, we would expect to see that new firms are larger, on average, than in the past — but the data don’t bear that out either.10 The inference, then, is that the amount of seed money necessary to get a new firm off the ground has not grown in any meaningful or outsized way.\n\nIt may be that regulation is affecting the business climate, just not in the way we usually think about it. It may be — to steal a phrase from another economist — more of a “death by a thousand cuts” than a single blow of the regulatory axe, with small changes and impediments combining to create a larger barrier.11\n\nInhibitors of local growth, such as zoning restrictions, could be impeding the flow of workers and capital to high productivity areas. The cost of relocating and attempting to start a new business in places like San Francisco or New York is all but prohibitive. By one estimate, lowering constraints — for instance, on housing supply — in high productivity cities would significantly expand their workforces and increase overall GDP by almost 10 percent.12\n\nImportantly, the fact that the decline in business dynamism is not confined to the United States, but is occurring across OECD countries, suggests that broader, systemic forces are likely playing a role.13 The knock-on effects of technological advancement and demographics are almost certainly involved, as they play a role in a variety of economic measures.\n\nA recent paper poses some interesting questions for the dynamism discussion.\n\nThe authors start with the groundwork: that economic activity is being concentrated in fewer firms; that entrepreneurship rates have been declining since the 1970s; and that there has been a decline in the share of GDP going to labor since 1975. Then they note that these trends share the underlying factor of firm demographics: Specifically that there is a shift in age distribution toward older firms — and older firms have higher employment concentration.\n\nFundamentally, a decline in labor force growth means lower entry rates for new firms. But since the 1970s, labor force growth has declined by 2 percentage points, while the entry rate of new businesses has declined by 6 percentage points — meaning labor force decline alone is not enough to account for the drop in start-ups.\n\nBut what if the decline in labor force growth also leads to changes in firm demographics, specifically in the average size and aggregate exit rate? In that instance, the effect of labor force growth on start-ups could be multiplied.14 This is an active and interesting area of research that I’ll be keeping an eye on.\n\nFinally, there is new research by staff at the Philadelphia Fed, which looks at the effect of interest rates.\n\nI want to make clear from the outset that I am not talking about the federal funds rate, which the Fed uses to execute monetary policy — and which we often refer to, as I have done today, simply by the shorthand of “rates.” They’re looking at natural rates of interest, which is an independent function of economic forces that is beyond the control of us mere mortals on the FOMC. We make our policy in the context set by that natural rate.\n\nLooking from the late 1990s to today, their research suggests that both the decline in the start-up rate and the rise in business concentration may be connected to the global decline in the natural rate over the same period.\n\nLarger firms’ cash flow is less volatile, allowing them to carry more debt against each dollar of asset. That advantage can make them more willing to buy up new ideas entering the market, particularly as borrowing costs decline. More research is needed, and there is no direct evidence that decreased interest rates have induced larger businesses to borrow with the specific intent of accumulating ideas. However, there is certainly a logical connection. If lower borrowing costs are causing more new ideas to be immediately absorbed into larger firms, then a drop in the start-up rate and growing concentration of sales in large firms are natural consequences.15\n\nIn fact, this research was sparked by a discussion we had a few years ago about the sluggishness of businesses’ real fixed investment growth in an era of record-low interest rates. We thought then that the low-rate environment might be making it more profitable for large firms to grow by acquiring other businesses, rather than building new capacity. The same logic is at work here: Bigger firms can borrow more cheaply than start-ups, which makes it more profitable for the bigger businesses to borrow against the cash flow of a new idea and buy it from the creators.\n\nI should also note here that measurement adds a level of complication to the mix. Creative destruction at the firm level isn’t captured by dynamism statistics. Take, for example, IBM’s reinvention in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the mainframe market. While it fundamentally remade itself into a different company, that shift wasn’t captured in the dynamism data on entry and exit. Dynamism doesn’t measure global activity very well either. In this case, Apple is the example. Apple constantly adds and drops suppliers as it continues its evolution in product development; in 2013, for instance, it had about 750 suppliers, but almost 90 percent of them were in Asia. That activity doesn’t show up in the U.S. dynamism statistics.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile we certainly have a measurement problem, it is still clear that dynamism is slowing and has been doing so steadily, not just in the U.S., but across mature economies. It is also the case that a number of factors are conspiring to keep it that way.\n\nI should note here that dynamism, much like food or wine, should be taken in moderation, and an excess could lead to something of an economic hangover. The downside of dynamism, and the risk of overindulging in it, would be a glut of churn and all its attendant costs — frequent bankruptcies and business failures, high rates of firings and layoffs, too much job-hopping by workers. But in an environment with the right amount, it has its intended effect: Resources are channeled to more productive uses, workers are more engaged with the labor market, and innovation is nurtured.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n[1]I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n\n[2]Ryan A.

            "content": "Note: President Harker presented similar remarks on March 25, 2019, at the OMFIF meeting in London.\n\nGuten Tag und danke. It’s a pleasure to be in Frankfurt. Since that greeting all but exhausted my German vocabulary, I’ll turn to something I’m more fluent in: policyspeak. I promise to pepper it with some actual English.\n\nI’ll start with a brief economic outlook, then turn to a topic that has garnered a surprising amount of attention in recent months: the Fed’s balance sheet. It is a subject rife with awkward economic phrasing, but an important one nonetheless, so I hope you’ll bear with me.\n\nBefore we get to that, however, a bit of verbiage required of all Fed policymakers and easily translatable: the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOutlook\n\nWith that out of the way, the promised outlook, which is, overall, pretty good.\n\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent sometime in 2020. That reflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics, muted growth in the labor force, and lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary headwind.\n\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace. Businesses, however, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in confidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not quite as rosy as last year. It’s certainly not dire, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a shadow, and the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\n\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and trade developments.\n\nFor the U.S. overall, I would say that, on balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside, but I emphasize the word “slight.” I still see the outlook as positive, and the economy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic expansion in our history.\n\nWe are also seeing continued strength in the labor market, with employment data continuing to show remarkable health — so much in fact, that it has surprised many of us. While there was widespread despairing over the February jobs report, I’d caution against getting caught up in a single data point. The medium term is what’s important, and over the past six months, we have created an average of 190,000 jobs a month.\n\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target and, importantly, does not appear to be on a strong upward trajectory. If anything, it’s edging slightly downward.\n\nBased on these combined conditions, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. My current view is that, at most, one rate hike this year, and one in 2020, is appropriate, and my stance will be guided by data as they come in and events as they unfold.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet — A Brief History and Where Things Stand Today\n\nBefore I head into the particulars of the balance sheet, I’d like to add some context, with a quick reminder of how we arrived here, and what, exactly, “here” is.\n\nIn response to the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks around the globe took a number of policy initiatives. Unlike many others, the Federal Reserve did not enter into a regime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the federal funds rate to essentially zero, and followed it with several rounds of quantitative easing.\n\nAs its more technical name — large-scale asset purchases — indicates, QE involved buying large amounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the Fed’s balance sheet to approximately $4.5 trillion — about five times its size before the onset of the crisis.\n\nThe last of the purchase programs ended in late 2014. At that point, the outlook for the U.S. economy had improved markedly and the Committee started to think about raising the federal funds rate, which was still essentially at zero. At the same time, they decided to keep the overall size of the balance sheet constant, reinvesting the proceedings as our asset holdings reached maturity.\n\nIn October of 2017, it was time for the balance sheet to start its journey back to normal. We began by reinvesting only some of the principal payments from our Treasury and MBS securities, and the balance sheet decreased by the amounts not reinvested. In other words, we let our assets run off at a gradual and predictable pace. Steady as that pace may be, however, we’ve already reduced our securities holdings by close to half a trillion dollars.\n\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, the aggregate level of reserves currently stands at roughly $1.6 trillion. That’s $1.2 trillion less than the peak of $2.8 trillion, back in 2014, and close to $600 billion less than when we started unwinding. Reserves declined by more than our asset redemptions due to the growth of non-reserve liabilities, mostly currency.\n\nWe noted at the time that the unwinding would be essentially on autopilot and spectacularly boring — though we were clear about our intent to keep an eye on things. Along the way, we have communicated our plans and principles regarding the normalization process. And from the very beginning, we made it clear that we intended to hold “no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”\n\nAs the balance sheet runoff unfolded, we rapidly approached the beginning of the end. Last November, we resumed our discussions of the Committee’s plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run.\n\nStaff from across the Federal Reserve System presented excellent work on an array of options.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we agreed that the current implementation framework has served us very well. Our administered rates have proven effective at controlling short-term interest rates. This allows us to continue using changes in the target range of the fed funds rate as the primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In January, therefore, we communicated our intention to maintain an “ample supply of reserves” that ensures control over the federal funds rate via our administered rates, without necessitating active management of the supply of reserves.\n\nTransition to the Long-Run Framework\n\nToday, we’re in a very good place. We know what we want the long-run framework to look like; we know that we’re getting closer every day; and we know that we’re not far from the efficient level of reserves. In the last meeting, therefore, we decided on one more step in the transition to the long-run framework.\n\nIn short, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September, resuming the reinvestment of all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, capped at $20 billion per month, will be reinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold primarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\n\nBut we are not quite done normalizing yet. We don’t just want an ample supply of reserves, we want “no more than necessary.” In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be somewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.\n\nA key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and we certainly don’t have the luxury of a tensile test — breaking points in engineering and economics are very different animals. We should therefore approach the “efficient and effective” level of reserves with caution.\n\nWe intend to do that by keeping the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a time. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\n\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia1 staff, is not only the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset redemptions. It is, therefore, firmly in line with the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in a “gradual and predictable manner.”\n\nAs reserves continue to decline, they will eventually reach their efficient and effective level, which prompts the question: Will that be the end point for normalization? Not quite. While the balance sheet will indeed hold no more securities than necessary, they will likely not be the securities we want to hold in the long run.\n\nA Matter of Principle(s)\n\nAs laid out in the Normalization Plans and Principles, our aim is for the balance sheet to consist primarily of Treasury securities. That is not its current composition, and won’t be for some time, with MBS still accounting for 40 percent of our total asset holdings. Additionally, the remaining maturity of our Treasury holdings is still relatively long — about two years longer than the average maturity of outstanding Treasury securities.\n\nThat means, of course, that we still have some normalizing to do. The conversation will naturally revolve around the long-run composition the FOMC wants to achieve. However, it’s important to note that “long run” does mean “long run” — this is a marathon, not a sprint. Even if economic and financial conditions evolve as anticipated, the composition of the balance sheet will not see any drastic change in the near future. And, as noted in January, the Committee is prepared to alter the size and composition of the balance sheet if future economic conditions warrant more accommodative policy than can be achieved by reductions in the federal funds rate alone.\n\nIt is my own view, therefore, that the discussion should give primacy to principles over goals, both in guiding the long-run composition of the portfolio and its management along the transition.\n\nIt’s something of a crutch in speechmaking to rely on quotes from the good and the great who came before us. So I ask your forgiveness as I fall into exactly that trap, and invoke an oft-cited line from FDR, that rules aren’t necessarily sacred, principles are.\n\nAmong those principles that should be granted sanctity in the debate are neutrality and flexibility, which had formed the basis of balance sheet management prior to the crisis.\n\nNeutrality should function as something of a Hippocratic Oath where market functioning is concerned, vowing to “do no harm.” Our Treasury holdings should, in principle, avoid cornering the market on any particular security. One option might be to simply match the maturity distribution of outstanding Treasuries, which would evenly distribute our footprint across maturities. We should also be mindful that recently issued Treasuries, deemed “on the run,” are vital for a well-functioning market. We should consider, therefore, how evenly acquisitions are spread at the Treasury primary auction.\n\nTurning to the principle of flexibility, in my view the asset portfolio should ideally allow us to quickly and safely deploy an array of balance sheet policies if necessary — again, this would only transpire if economic conditions warranted more accommodation than the federal funds rate alone can provide. This is where an asset portfolio with a somewhat shorter duration offers an advantage: The shorter the duration of the portfolio, the larger the flow of maturing proceeds at any given time. That flow can be redirected, allowing for a swift change in the composition without expanding the balance sheet or having to sell assets outright. A simple way to ensure that the balance sheet delivers a steady flow of maturing proceeds is to increase Treasury holdings, which have a maturity of a year or less.\n\nThis approach — that is, extending the duration of our Treasury securities without expanding the balance sheet — was the basis of the Maturity Extension Program, or Operation Twist, as it was sometimes known, in 2011.\n\nWhile I believe that neutrality and flexibility should be our core guidelines, I should stress that they are not the only factors to consider, and I look forward to discussions with my FOMC colleagues and staff across the Federal Reserve System.\n\nFinally, I want to note that balance sheet normalization has received a lot of attention both in our meetings and communications, and will continue to do so. While that does reflect its importance, it does not reflect our current monetary policy stance. We often refer to the FOMC’s “toolkit” when discussing policy options. Balance sheet policy certainly remains an option, but we’ve put it back in the toolbox, and stored it in the basement — within arm’s reach, but out of sight for now.\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, I end where I started: Things are looking pretty good. The fundamentals of the U.S. economy are strong, and we’re on the path to normal. There will be many more discussions as things unfold — heavily laden with policyspeak, in all likelihood, but important nonetheless.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n[1]I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s an absolute pleasure to be back in London.\n\nBritain and America are, famously, two countries separated by a common language. I’m afraid I’m going to add a third to the mix today, veering into a bit of policyspeak. I promise to pepper it with some actual English. And some American.\n\nI’ll start with a brief economic outlook, then turn to a topic that has garnered a surprising amount of attention in recent months: the Fed’s balance sheet. It is a subject rife with awkward economic phrasing, but an important one nonetheless, so I hope you’ll bear with me.\n\nBefore we get to that, however, a bit of verbiage required of all Fed policymakers and easily translatable: the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nOutlook\n\nWith that out of the way, the promised outlook, which is, overall, pretty good.\n\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent sometime in 2020. That reflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics, muted growth in the labor force, and lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary headwind.\n\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace. Businesses, however, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in confidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not quite as rosy as last year. It’s certainly not dire, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a shadow, and the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\n\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and trade developments. Of course, I could not be in London without noting that, yes, Brexit is indeed a part of that landscape.\n\nFor the U.S. overall, I would say that, on balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside, but I emphasize the word “slight.” I still see the outlook as positive, and the economy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic expansion in our history.\n\nWe are also seeing continued strength in the labor market, with employment data continuing to show remarkable health — so much in fact, that it has surprised many of us. While there was widespread despairing over the February jobs report, I’d caution against getting caught up in a single data point. The medium term is what’s important, and over the past six months, we have created an average of 190,000 jobs a month.\n\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target and, importantly, does not appear to be on a strong upward trajectory. If anything, it’s edging slightly downward.\n\nBased on these combined conditions, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. My current view is that, at most, one rate hike this year, and one in 2020, is appropriate, and my stance will be guided by data as they come in and events as they unfold.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet — A Brief History and Where Things Stand Today\n\nBefore I head into the particulars of the balance sheet, I’d like to add some context, with a quick reminder of how we arrived here, and what, exactly, “here” is.\n\nIn response to the financial crisis and its aftermath, central banks around the globe took a number of policy initiatives. Unlike many others, the Federal Reserve did not enter into a regime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the federal funds rate to essentially zero, and followed it with several rounds of quantitative easing.\n\nAs its more technical name — large-scale asset purchases — indicates, QE involved buying large amounts of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the Fed’s balance sheet to approximately $4.5 trillion — about five times its size before the onset of the crisis.\n\nThe last of the purchase programs ended in late 2014. At that point, the outlook for the U.S. economy had improved markedly and the Committee started to think about raising the federal funds rate, which was still essentially at zero. At the same time, they decided to keep the overall size of the balance sheet constant, reinvesting the proceedings as our asset holdings reached maturity.\n\nIn October of 2017, it was time for the balance sheet to start its journey back to normal. We began by reinvesting only some of the principal payments from our Treasury and MBS securities, and the balance sheet decreased by the amounts not reinvested. In other words, we let our assets run off at a gradual and predictable pace. Steady as that pace may be, however, we’ve already reduced our securities holdings by close to half a trillion dollars.\n\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, the aggregate level of reserves currently stands at roughly $1.6 trillion. That’s $1.2 trillion less than the peak of $2.8 trillion, back in 2014, and close to $600 billion less than when we started unwinding. Reserves declined by more than our asset redemptions due to the growth of non-reserve liabilities, mostly currency.\n\nWe noted at the time that the unwinding would be essentially on autopilot and spectacularly boring — though we were clear about our intent to keep an eye on things. Along the way, we have communicated our plans and principles regarding the normalization process. And from the very beginning, we made it clear that we intended to hold “no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”\n\nAs the balance sheet runoff unfolded, we rapidly approached the beginning of the end. Last November, we resumed our discussions of the Committee’s plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run.\n\nStaff from across the Federal Reserve System presented excellent work on an array of options.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we agreed that the current implementation framework has served us very well. Our administered rates have proven effective at controlling short-term interest rates. This allows us to continue using changes in the target range of the fed funds rate as the primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In January, therefore, we communicated our intention to maintain an “ample supply of reserves” that ensures control over the federal funds rate via our administered rates, without necessitating active management of the supply of reserves.\n\nTransition to the Long-Run Framework\n\nToday, we’re in a very good place. We know what we want the long-run framework to look like; we know that we’re getting closer every day; and we know that we’re not far from the efficient level of reserves. In the last meeting, therefore, we decided on one more step in the transition to the long-run framework.\n\nIn short, we intend to end the balance sheet runoff in September, resuming the reinvestment of all principal payments. Paydowns from MBS, capped at $20 billion per month, will be reinvested into Treasuries, which is consistent with our long-standing plans to hold primarily Treasuries in our portfolio.\n\nBut we are not quite done normalizing yet. We don’t just want an ample supply of reserves, we want “no more than necessary.” In September, when the runoff ends, reserves will likely still be somewhat above the level needed to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.\n\nA key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and we certainly don’t have the luxury of a tensile test — breaking points in engineering and economics are very different animals. We should therefore approach the “efficient and effective” level of reserves with caution.\n\nWe intend to do that by keeping the size of our aggregate securities holdings constant for a time. During this period, we will see a very — and I do stress “very” — gradual decrease in average reserves, as currency and other non-reserve liabilities grow over time.\n\nThis slow and steady approach, which is based on work by the Philadelphia1 staff, is not only the safer option, it has the additional advantage of reducing uncertainty about the evolution of asset redemptions.

            "content": "Note: President Harker presented similar remarks on February 13, 2019, at the Jewish Business Network Luncheon in Philadelphia.\n\nGood afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here. Before I start today, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the organization that brings us here today: The Philadelphia Inquirer. Right now, journalism as a whole seems to find itself increasingly in peril and subject to disruption — by which I mean the old-school definition of almost daily change and turmoil, rather than the tech-world application of the word. So it’s more important than ever to recognize the truly irreplaceable service it provides, and its essential role in American life and democracy.\n\nWhile I consider the Inquirer to be a national outlet, like its counterparts in L.A. or Chicago, these all provide the truly essential — and ever more endangered — function of local reporting as well.\n\nI’m sure I speak for everyone here, and residents of Philadelphia and beyond, when I say we are deeply grateful for the gift Gerry Lenfest gave the Inquirer family of outlets and the city of Philadelphia in preserving them with his generous donation.\n\nGood journalism is both an art and a public good, so thank you to everyone involved in the Inquirer and its sister publications.\n\nI’m going to start this afternoon with an economic outlook — where we are, where we’re likely headed, and what I’m watching as we make our way there — and then discuss something that’s a focus of ours at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia: the labor market, skills, and the future of work.\n\nBefore I start, let me issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent some time in 2020. While some may view that growth rate as disappointing, it reflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics, muted growth in the labor force, and lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary headwind. So I still see the outlook as positive: The U.S. economy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic expansion in our history.\n\nI should also deliver the caveat that those projections are for the year as a whole. I expect Q1 of this year to come in closer to 1.5 percent; there are multiple contributing factors here, not least being that first quarters have seen low or negative growth for several years running, enough to have essentially become the norm. That should balance out as growth picks up in the following quarters.\n\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace.\n\nBusinesses, on the other hand, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in confidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not quite as rosy as last year. It’s certainly not a dire one, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a shadow, and the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\n\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and trade developments.\n\nOn balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside, but I emphasize the word “slight.” It’s a gradient measured by a protractor rather than one apparent to the naked eye.\n\nOverall, the economy remains in good shape.\n\nEmployment\n\nOne clear example is the continued strength of the labor market. Employment data continue to show remarkable health and, in fact, have surprised many of the experts. Job creation continues at a strong pace, quits are still high, and the slight upticks in the unemployment rate over the past couple of months reflect more people coming off the sidelines to join the labor market.\n\nIn fact, the primary concern we’re hearing anecdotally is not the lack of jobs but the dearth of skilled workers.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target. For several years, it was persistently low, finally moving up to our goal last year. I see inflation running slightly higher than 2 percent for this year and next.\n\nAs Fed watchers well know, when we say our goal is 2 percent inflation, we don’t mean the sweet spot is exactly 2 percent all the time; it’s our medium-term average. While I would be concerned if it rose significantly above that marker, running slightly above, as I predict we will this year and next, is not something that provokes concern, particularly after a sustained period of underperformance.\n\nImportantly, I’m focused on core inflation, which strips out volatile elements like food and energy, giving a better understanding of the fundamentals. Headline inflation is likely to suffer with fluctuations in energy prices, but those are transient and do not have a marked effect on the underlying measure.\n\nWhat I’m watching most closely is inflation’s trajectory: what direction it’s headed and how fast. Right now, we’re not seeing significant upward pressure, and it’s not on an accelerated path; if anything, it’s edging slightly downward. If that scenario changes, the data will guide my views.\n\nRates\n\nWith a temperate climate for inflation; continued strength in the labor market; very slight downside risks; solid, but moderate growth projections for the next couple of years; and, of course, a climate of uncertainty, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. Or, to use the word of the moment, I see patience as a virtue. My own view is that one rate hike for 2019 and one for 2020 are appropriate.\n\nAs ever, that’s my current stance, and my views will be guided by data as they come in and events as they unfold. I know some people wish that Fed officials would retire the metaphorical pencil we use in our forecasts and be more forceful in our estimates. And I’m happy to use a pen … so long as it’s filled with erasable ink. We have to make policy decisions in context, and I’ve shared my outlook given the landscape on February 28, 2019. If we had a perfectly functioning crystal ball, those predictions would be infallible – and I’d be playing the lottery a lot more.\n\nSkills and the Workforce\n\nOf course, while we can’t prognosticate with absolute certainty, we can make educated guesses about a host of issues.\n\nOne that’s of particular interest at the Philadelphia Fed is the future of work, and how cities and regions across the country are preparing for the changes that are already well underway.\n\nThere have been two discussions about the labor market that have taken center stage of late, the first being the skills shortage and the difficulty employers report in finding qualified workers. The other is the effect of artificial intelligence and automation on the current and future employment landscape. The two obviously go hand in hand.\n\nWhile both have received an abundance of attention, the discussions are decidedly nuanced, and it’s important to understand both the risks and the opportunities these issues present.\n\nThe opportunity is that we can see change coming and not only prepare for it, but rise to meet it. This is in the economic interests of both individual businesses and the cities and regions in which they operate. The risk, of course, is in ignoring the change and failing to prepare for it.\n\nAutomation is coming; in fact, it’s already here. But much of the popular conversation veers from practicalities. Rather than look at the jobs that have already been, or are on the precipice of being, automated, speculation runs to the entirety of human capabilities somehow being mechanized.\n\nWhat the current trend in automation has actually done is thrown into stark relief the importance of uniquely human attributes, what we tend to refer to as “soft skills.” These are as in demand among employers as technical skills, if not more so.\n\nThe truth is that the scope of artificial intelligence is limited to our input; that is, machines are only as smart as we make them. The important conversation, in my view, is not whether robots may someday write the great American novel, but what the current capabilities of automation mean for the people in our workforce now and how it will shape the near future.\n\nWe recently published research on the likely effect of automation, both within the Federal Reserve’s Third District and in the U.S. We not only identified jobs that are in danger of automating, we assigned degrees of likelihood to their eventual demise. We also looked at who’s doing those jobs, who would be hardest hit, and whether and where new jobs might be created.\n\nWe concluded that almost one in five jobs in our District have a 95 percent or better chance of becoming automated, and that the people doing them are some of the economy’s most vulnerable workers. While some people will be absorbed into new jobs, others won’t.\n\nInstead of leaving the disruption of various industries to fate, we have an opportunity to think about how to train the workers whose jobs will likely disappear. That’s everything from the jobs that have yet to be created to the ones that are standing empty right now.\n\nAs I mentioned, one of the most frequent complaints we’ve heard from business is the shortage of skilled workers. While there has been some debate about the skills shortage, our research certainly points to a gap and the JOLTS data in particular support it.\n\nWe also have research underway. Our economists took a very large data set — more than 90 percent of all online postings — to analyze what factors impact the length of time a job stays open or, in their parlance, the “time to fill.” They looked over a two-year span, from 2015 to 2017, for the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas to see, among other things, what factors influenced the time-to-fill stretch and whether requirements for certain levels of experience and educational attainment affect that metric.\n\nTheir preliminary findings confirm what we’ve been hearing anecdotally and what we’ve seen in other research — that there is a gap between the skills employers want and need and those in the available workforce.\n\nThey found that the easiest jobs to fill are those that are generally routine, manual positions — the same ones that are at the highest risk of automation.\n\nThe most difficult to fill are those that require specific cognitive, and uniquely human, skills: teachers, for instance, or psychologists.\n\nThe more skill required, the longer a job takes to fill; likewise, the higher the bar for educational attainment and years’ experience, the more time the position will remain open.\n\nWhile the research is as yet unpublished, the early findings pose questions for the labor market.\n\nShould, for instance, employers consider hiring candidates who are good, rather than ideal, and focus on in-house training to make up the difference? Considering the combined losses associated with unfilled positions and the expense of a candidate search, it is likely more cost-effective for many organizations.\n\nThis is something we’ve been discussing with employers across the region. In fact, the Philadelphia Fed has formed a partnership with Philadelphia Works, Social Finance, and a local company to change the way we prepare the local workforce for the future of work. The pilot is a unique public-private partnership, in which the public sector will provide customized training and the employer will repay the cost of that training once the outcomes are realized.\n\nThe reality of the tight labor market means that employers have to start thinking creatively and long term about how they’re going to address the gap between the skills they want and need and those available in the labor pool. What makes this project stand out is just that: The employer isn’t funding it through their foundation; it’s coming right out of the HR budget. It’s a business decision. And not only will they get an agile, trained workforce, but it adds to the city’s labor pool overall.\n\nIt’s my hope that more businesses in the region — and across the country — will begin to take another look at how they’re approaching training and hiring. This will be especially important as the baby boom generation continues its march into retirement and the importance of succession planning takes on new urgency across the professional spectrum.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up: The economy continues to do well. I continue to be happily patient in my outlook on raising rates and will monitor the data as they come in. And importantly, I hope that this point in the labor market’s history will prove to be the catalyst for employers to reconsider their approach to training, and what role they can play in arming people with the skills both employers and employees need.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Welcome and Introductions\n\nGood afternoon and welcome. It’s a pleasure to be moderating this discussion of a subject that’s gathered interest and commentary from a vast array of outlets: the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and what the future holds.\n\nI’m joined today by my colleague Jim Bullard, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; Lisa Emsbo-Mattingly, director of research in the Global Asset Allocation group at Fidelity Investments; and another colleague, Governor Randy Quarles of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Everyone here is familiar with our panelists, and their bios are in front of you, so I’ll skip the customary recitation of their CVs — which are obviously as long as they are impressive, and I think we’d all rather spend that time hearing what they have to say.\n\nBefore I start, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System — something that my colleagues and I may well demonstrate in a few minutes. I will, however, speak on their behalf to say that the disclaimer extends to all of us, to spare them having to repeat it.\n\nThe Fed’s Balance Sheet — A Brief History and Where Things Stand Today\n\nBefore I ask the first question, I’d like to start by putting the subject of the discussion in context, with a quick reminder of the present state of the balance sheet and its recent history.\n\nIn October of 2017, we started the normalization process by decreasing the reinvestment of principal payments from our Treasury and MBS securities. Since then, we’ve reduced our securities holdings by close to half a trillion dollars.\n\nThe aggregate level of reserves currently stands at roughly $1.6 trillion. That’s $600 billion less than when we started unwinding, because reserves decline both with asset redemptions and the growth of other liabilities, such as currency. Overall, the current level of reserves is $1.2 trillion less than the peak of $2.8 trillion, back in 2014.\n\nWe noted at the time that the unwinding would be essentially on autopilot and spectacularly boring — though we were clear about our intent to keep an eye on things.\n\nAs that process has unfolded, and aggregate reserves have declined, we’re coming to a more interesting juncture. And so, in recognition of the beginning of the end, last November we resumed our discussions of the Committee’s plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run.\n\nStaff from across the Federal Reserve System presented excellent work on an array of options.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we agreed that the current implementation framework has served us very well. Our administered rates have proven effective at controlling short-term interest rates. This allows us to continue using changes in the target range of the fed funds rate as the primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. In January, therefore, we communicated our intention to maintain an “ample supply of reserves,” that ensures control over the federal funds rate via our administered rates, without necessitating active management of the supply of reserves.\n\nTransition to the Long-Run Framework\n\nSo we stand today knowing what we want the long-run framework to look like, knowing that we are getting closer every day, and knowing that we are not that far from the efficient level of reserves. We have therefore started discussing our transition plans to the long-run implementation framework, and will continue to do that in future meetings.\n\nIn my view, a key issue is that we only have estimates of the demand for reserves, and we certainly don’t have the luxury of a tensile test — breaking points in engineering and monetary policy are very different animals.\n\nIt is my own view that we should approach the end of normalization with caution. Based on work by my staff, I have proposed that we can substantially slow the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings later this year; reserves would then diminish at a very gradual pace, reflecting the trend growth of other Federal Reserve liabilities.1\n\nA slow and steady approach is not only the safer option, it’s one that will reduce uncertainty about the evolution of the balance sheet. It is also firmly in line with the FOMC’s stated objective to proceed in a “gradual and predictable manner.”\n\nQuestions for the Panel\n\nBack when we started the normalization journey, I promised that it would be the policy equivalent of watching paint dry — and it certainly was, for over a year. Yet despite laying out a gradual, predictable path, and communicating that path with regularity, the recent interest in the subject makes me wonder if I’ve underestimated the allure of dried paint.\n\nSo I would like to start by asking our panelists: Given that the reduction in asset holdings was announced well in advance, and given that it proceeded smoothly in the background as promised, why is it that balance sheet policy has suddenly leapt to the front page?\n\nI’ll parcel that with a related question, because the public discussion will turn next to the composition of the balance sheet: We are on record as preferring that our securities holdings be primarily Treasuries, but what about their maturity composition? More broadly, what should be our most important considerations in discussing the composition of the balance sheet?\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\n[1] I would like to thank Roc Armenter for his research and insight.\n\n",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s an absolute pleasure to be back on the UD campus and an honor to be asked to speak today.\n\nI’ve been asked to talk about leadership, and in thinking about what I wanted to say, I realized that the best lessons I’ve learned, and any wisdom I have to impart, come from other people.\n\nIt’s said that good artists borrow and great artists steal, and it seems I’ve applied that to career philosophies. So I’m very happy to share lessons on leadership today, with the strict proviso that pretty much everything worth sharing I’ve learned from someone else.\n\nIf it’s helpful, you’re welcome; if it’s not, well, I’m telling you exactly whom to blame …\n\nGood Advice Can Come from Anyone\n\nNumber one — and I list this as number one because it’s the one I always tell my kids, it’s the one that’s been the foundation of every good step I’ve taken in life, and because it’s totally unoriginal but nonetheless true — is: Keep learning and be open to advice from a multitude of sources.\n\nYour education doesn’t end when you graduate, it’s just starting. Always take a job that teaches you something, particularly early on in your career, and don’t limit your pool of instruction. The most influential people in your lives, the ones who will teach you the most, aren’t always going to be your bosses or formal mentors. They’re colleagues, people junior to you, support staff, and people whose roles have nothing to do with your own. Be open to learning and be receptive to everyone.\n\nIf you had asked me even a few years ago, I would never have guessed I’d be here today — moving from a career in academia to making monetary policy for the world’s most powerful economy? I probably would have laughed. But I didn’t see myself in academia at first either. That was just as implausible to a kid from a family of pipefitters in a blue-collar New Jersey town. My sister and I were the first in our family to go to college, and even when I got there, as a football player on scholarship, it had never occurred to me that I could wind up in a professor’s chair.\n\nIt was the secretary in the engineering department, Shelley Brown, who saw something in me that I couldn’t see in myself. Well, she saw something in me, and she may have been mildly irritated with me as well … I got injured my junior year, and I was haunting the halls of the department when she decided I needed something to do. She sent me to a professor who needed an assistant and that was it; I found something I loved and I had a new goal.\n\nThe track I was on was headed toward something perfectly good — I’d planned on getting an engineering job when I finished undergrad. But Shelley flipped a switch that diverted the route and sent me to a PhD and academic career. It never would have happened if she hadn’t made that connection, and it never would’ve happened if I hadn’t listened.\n\nBe Scared\n\nSo that’s number one of the Rules Pat Harker Stole from Smarter People. And it’s important to continue learning throughout your career, which takes on increasing consequence as you move up the ladder. So my next bit of advice is: Be scared. In fact, let yourself be absolutely terrified.\n\nI know that “feel the fear and do it anyway” isn’t original advice. But I can offer a formula. Again, it’s one I owe entirely to someone else, and it’s advice that’s been invaluable to me over the years.\n\nIt’s actually from a UD donor who had a fascinating career — not just prestigious positions but incredibly diverse and interesting ones. Obviously, I wanted to know how someone makes such an unexpected journey, and she said she relied on two things: She always wanted to be somewhere that taught her something new, and she knew a job was right if she was 70 percent sure she could absolutely excel in it and 30 percent scared to death that she’d have no idea what she was doing.\n\nIt remains some of the best advice I’ve ever heard.\n\nThat fear creates a challenge. It makes us work harder. It trains our focus. And it makes us comfortable with the discomfort of fear itself. This is not so much advice as a secret from the trenches: Imposter syndrome is real. At some point, you’ll have the feeling that you don’t belong where you are, and you’ll be panicking that you’ll be found out.\n\nDon’t worry, 99.9 percent of the population can relate. It’s normal, it’s healthy, and if you meet fear halfway, you’ll not only start to get used to it, you’ll get better at moving beyond it. Be 30 percent terrified; it’s a good thing.\n\nI should note that there are some limits to this advice: If you’re headed into brain surgery or in charge of a large stockpile of nuclear weapons, then please, be very sure you know what you’re doing.\n\nBe Good\n\nNumber three in Other People’s Wisdom is what I learned from some of the best mentors anyone could ask for. And that is: Be a good person.\n\nBy “good” I don’t mean adhering to the tenets of some arbitrary cultural or social code; I mean: Be reliable, be honest, be helpful.\n\nThe organizational psychologist Adam Grant talks about “givers and takers”: the people who either focus on what people can do for them or what they can do for people. When you operate in “give” mode at work, you’re making things run more smoothly, but you’re also doing yourself a favor.\n\nOperating in “give” mode is how you become the go-to person. It’s how you become the person everybody wants on their team. When you make the choice to be the person who will take five minutes, even if you’re under deadline, to help out a colleague, you become invaluable.\n\nBeing “good” is about integrity. And yes, I’m making a relatively old-fashioned case. But it’s one that’s stood the test of time. It may not fit into the popular narrative of cutthroat maneuvering where nice guys finish last, but the most respected leaders I’ve ever known haven’t been amoral raiders; they’ve been honest, authentic, and trustworthy to their core.\n\nThere will, of course, always be examples of bravado outperforming hard work. And flashes in the pan sometimes last a little longer than they should. But eventually, those people get found out. And in the long run, the most important asset you have — and the one thing in life you can control — is your integrity. We rarely have a say in what life throws at us, but we do decide how we handle it. In the course of my life, I have seen over and over that solidity of character will always triumph, and honesty and integrity have been the marks of every great leader I’ve had the privilege to know.\n\nBuild a Good Team and Know How to Run It\n\nThat grounding is especially important, because a lot of leadership is, frankly, drawing fire. And very little consists of basking in glory.\n\nSo my next bit of advice is to build a good team and know how to run it.\n\nPerhaps the most essential trait of those who do this exceptionally well is knowing what they don’t know.\n\nDavid Pottruck, the former CEO of Charles Schwab, used to talk about “leading from the middle.” What I take from that, in a nutshell, is that you’re not always going to be the smartest person in the room. If you’re lucky, you’ve assembled a good enough team that you’re rarely the smartest person in the room.\n\nGood leaders are able to cede control to someone else. Yes, you’re the ultimate decision maker, but the best leaders know how to defer to the experts and follow their advice. Great leadership isn’t knowing everything; great leadership is knowing who your experts are and letting them guide you. There is no greater mark of intellectual insecurity than pretending you know something you don’t, and the most talented leaders invite input from all sides.\n\nAnother hallmark of a good leader is a team that fills in his or her weaknesses. As a CEO or a part of a team, I’d be wary of any manager who hires in their own image. To paraphrase something an HR partner of ours says, “If I’ve got five people who think exactly the same, I don’t need four of them.”\n\nGreat leaders build great teams, but they also know how to manage them. And, as I said, a lot of that is thankless. The trick is to do it with grace and humility.\n\nThis time, I’m cribbing from the great Colin Powell, whom I first heard speak about leadership early on in my career, when I was part of the White House Fellows program. I’d highly recommend searching out his magnum opus of advice because it’s truly some of the best you’ll find. In this instance, I’m keeping it to the hard, but essential, lessons that accompany the role.\n\nFirst, when you’re the leader of a team, you take responsibility for the group. That means you always give the credit, and you always take the blame.\n\nSecond, take the pain early. That means when an issue arises, deal with it — don’t kick the can down the road. The longer you let it sit, the more it will fester, the bigger it will grow, and the more severe the consequences will be in the end.\n\nBe Adaptable and Let People Talk You into Things\n\nOne of the most important lessons I’ve learned, in particular from the people around me, is to be adaptable. As I said, we have very little control over what life sends our way; we can only control how we deal with it.\n\nIt surprises people to hear, but the truth is that being dean of Wharton wasn’t part of my plan. I had young kids and I knew what the job entailed. People thought I was too young, and I frankly was perfectly happy in an academic role. But the people who knew me — from a long-time mentor to an advisor who’s still telling me what to do — talked me into it.\n\nIt was absolutely the right thing to do, but it took convincing. The moral of the story is that the people around you, the ones who’ve seen you grow and develop in your career, often know you better than you know yourself. So listen to them.\n\nAnd be prepared for what comes next. Being adaptable is a skill, but change doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and the old adage rings true: When you walk through one door, another closes. You’re going to make choices in your careers, big and small, that will have consequences — and as much as what you choose to do will impact your life, so will the things you choose not to do.\n\nSo my tremendously profound advice is: Don’t overthink it.\n\nThe best any of us can do is pick a general direction and be open to changes along the way. I have a friend from my White House days who has had a detailed five-year plan since we met there in 1991. Every five years, he lays out a detailed schematic of where his life is headed. And for almost 30 years, it has not gone according to plan. Not once. Not a single year.\n\nSo be open to change, because, as the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans. Especially if they’re detailed, five-year ones …\n\nJump\n\nThat flexibility will help you do the final thing that other people’s wisdom has taught me, which is that sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. Sometimes you just have to jump.\n\nWhen I first got to UD, I spent the first year working out our strategic plan with my team. It was beautiful; a really exceptional plan … This is what we call foreshadowing, and I’m pretty sure you all know what happened next. Life happened, of course. Or, I should say, the Great Recession happened, and the world turned upside down.\n\nIn the middle of our derailed plans, I got a call from an old colleague of mine who was then at Chrysler, asking if we wanted to buy their plant. Which, to be honest, sounded a little ridiculous. Actually, it sounded a lot ridiculous. But we kept thinking about it — a little at first, and then almost obsessively. Because the more we looked at it, the more it seemed like the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nIt wasn’t easy. First we had to convince ourselves, and then we had to convince everyone else: trustees, faculty, elected officials, the community. It took a lot of collaboration and a lot of discussion and a lot of tenacity. But we did it.\n\nI don’t want to sound wildly self-congratulatory — and I technically can’t because it was entirely a group effort — but I truly believe that buying that plant was the best investment the university has made in 100 years. The resources that investment brought us, and the development underway, are the future both of the university itself and of the economy of the state of Delaware. We’re talking about a major hub of science and technology, a winner of major grants, jobs for the community … It truly is an encapsulation of our collective future, and it’s one of the absolute highlights of my professional life to have been a part of it.\n\nBut it took a lot to get us there. It took being open to insight from unlikely sources. It took swallowing a healthy dose of fear. It took the faith and goodwill we built through honesty and integrity. It took assembling an expert team to tell us what we didn’t know. It took adapting to a new set of circumstances. And it took a leap of faith.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed here are the speaker’s own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, welcome, and shalom. It’s a pleasure to have everyone here. Given the unpredictability of February weather in Philadelphia, it’s an even bigger pleasure to have such a short commute — so we’re particularly happy to be hosting you today.\n\nI’m going to start this afternoon with an economic outlook — where we are, where we’re likely headed, and what I’m watching as we make our way there — and then discuss something that’s a focus of ours here at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia: the labor market, skills, and the future of work.\n\nBefore I start, let me issue the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nStarting with GDP, I see growth a bit above 2 percent for this year, returning to trend of around 2 percent some time in 2020. While some may view that growth rate as disappointing, it reflects structural, slow-moving forces — like demographics, muted growth in the labor force, and lower productivity growth — rather than any temporary headwind. So I still see the outlook as positive: The U.S. economy continues to grow in what is on pace to be the longest economic expansion in our history.\n\nI should also deliver the caveat that those projections are for the year as a whole. I expect Q1 of this year to come in closer to 1.5 percent; there are multiple contributing factors here, not least being that first quarters have seen low or negative growth for several years running, enough to have essentially become the norm. That should balance out as growth picks up in the following quarters.\n\nPCE remains the primary driver of real GDP growth, and household spending continues at a strong, sustained pace.\n\nBusinesses, on the other hand, have reported an increase in uncertainty and a decrease in confidence. Coupled with tighter financial conditions, the investment outlook is not quite as rosy as last year. It’s certainly not a dire one, but the specter of uncertainty does cast a shadow, and the ambiguity of the current climate appears to be having a dampening effect.\n\nI am also monitoring international influences, including the outlook for growth abroad and trade developments.\n\nOn balance, the potential risks tilt very slightly to the downside, but I emphasize the word “slight.” It’s a gradient measured by a protractor rather than one apparent to the naked eye.\n\nOverall, the economy remains in good shape.\n\nEmployment\n\nOne clear example is the continued strength of the labor market. Employment data continue to show remarkable health and, in fact, have surprised many of the experts. Job creation continues at a strong pace, quits are still high, and the slight upticks in the unemployment rate over the past couple of months reflect more people coming off the sidelines to join the labor market.\n\nIn fact, the primary concern we’re hearing anecdotally is not the lack of jobs but the dearth of skilled workers.\n\nInflation\n\nInflation is running around our preferred 2 percent target. For several years, it was persistently low, finally moving up to our goal last year. I see inflation running slightly higher than 2 percent for this year and next.\n\nAs Fed watchers well know, when we say our goal is 2 percent inflation, we don’t mean the sweet spot is exactly 2 percent all the time; it’s our medium-term average. While I would be concerned if it rose significantly above that marker, running slightly above, as I predict we will this year and next, is not something that provokes concern, particularly after a sustained period of underperformance.\n\nImportantly, I’m focused on core inflation, which strips out volatile elements like food and energy, giving a better understanding of the fundamentals. Headline inflation is likely to suffer with fluctuations in energy prices, but those are transient and do not have a marked effect on the underlying measure.\n\nWhat I’m watching most closely is inflation’s trajectory: what direction it’s headed and how fast. Right now, we’re not seeing significant upward pressure, and it’s not on an accelerated path; if anything, it’s edging slightly downward. If that scenario changes, the data will guide my views.\n\nRates\n\nWith a temperate climate for inflation; continued strength in the labor market; very slight downside risks; solid, but moderate growth projections for the next couple of years; and, of course, a climate of uncertainty, I continue to be in wait-and-see mode. Or, to use the word of the moment, I see patience as a virtue. My own view is that one rate hike for 2019 and one for 2020 are appropriate.\n\nAs ever, that’s my current stance, and my views will be guided by data as they come in and events as they unfold. I know some people wish that Fed officials would retire the metaphorical pencil we use in our forecasts and be more forceful in our estimates. And I’m happy to use a pen … so long as it’s filled with erasable ink. We have to make policy decisions in context, and I’ve shared my outlook given the landscape on February 13, 2019. If we had a perfectly functioning crystal ball, those predictions would be infallible – and I’d be playing the lottery a lot more.\n\nSkills and the Workforce\n\nOf course, while we can’t prognosticate with absolute certainty, we can make educated guesses about a host of issues.\n\nOne that’s of particular interest here at the Philadelphia Fed is the future of work, and how cities and regions across the country are preparing for the changes that are already well underway.\n\nThere have been two discussions about the labor market that have taken center stage of late, the first being the skills shortage and the difficulty employers report in finding qualified workers. The other is the effect of artificial intelligence and automation on the current and future employment landscape. The two obviously go hand in hand.\n\nWhile both have received an abundance of attention, the discussions are decidedly nuanced, and it’s important to understand both the risks and the opportunities these issues present.\n\nThe opportunity is that we can see change coming and not only prepare for it, but rise to meet it. This is in the economic interests of both individual businesses and the cities and regions in which they operate. The risk, of course, is in ignoring the change and failing to prepare for it.\n\nAutomation is coming; in fact, it’s already here. But much of the popular conversation veers from practicalities. Rather than look at the jobs that have already been, or are on the precipice of being, automated, speculation runs to the entirety of human capabilities somehow being mechanized.\n\nWhat the current trend in automation has actually done is thrown into stark relief the importance of uniquely human attributes, what we tend to refer to as “soft skills.” These are as in demand among employers as technical skills, if not more so.\n\nThe truth is that the scope of artificial intelligence is limited to our input; that is, machines are only as smart as we make them. The important conversation, in my view, is not whether robots may someday write the great American novel but what the current capabilities of automation mean for the people in our workforce now and how it will shape the near future.\n\nWe recently published research on the likely effect of automation, both within the Federal Reserve’s Third District and in the U.S. We not only identified jobs that are in danger of automating, we assigned degrees of likelihood to their eventual demise. We also looked at who’s doing those jobs, who would be hardest hit, and whether and where new jobs might be created.\n\nWe concluded that almost one in five jobs in our District have a 95 percent or better chance of becoming automated and that the people doing them are some of the economy’s most vulnerable workers. While some people will be absorbed into new jobs, others won’t.\n\nInstead of leaving the disruption of various industries to fate, we have an opportunity to think about how to train the workers whose jobs will likely disappear to do jobs that are more secure from the ones that have yet to be created to the ones that are standing empty right now.\n\nAs I mentioned, one of the most frequent complaints we’ve heard from business is the shortage of skilled workers. While there has been some debate about the skills shortage, our research certainly points to a gap and the JOLTS data in particular support it.\n\nWe also have research underway. Our economists took a very large data set — more than 90 percent of all online postings — to analyze what factors impact the length of time a job stays open or, in their parlance, the “time to fill.” They looked over a two-year span, from 2015 to 2017, for the 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas to see, among other things, what factors influenced the time-to-fill stretch and whether requirements for certain levels of experience and educational attainment affect that metric.\n\nTheir preliminary findings confirm what we’ve been hearing anecdotally and what we’ve seen in other research — that there is a gap between the skills employers want and need and those in the available workforce.\n\nThey found that the easiest jobs to fill are those that are generally routine, manual positions — the same ones that are at the highest risk of automation.\n\nThe most difficult to fill are those that require specific cognitive, and uniquely human, skills: teachers, for instance, or psychologists.\n\nThe more skill required, the longer a job takes to fill; likewise, the higher the bar for educational attainment and years’ experience, the more time the position will remain open.\n\nWhile the research is as yet unpublished, the early findings pose questions for the labor market.\n\nShould, for instance, employers consider hiring candidates who are good, rather than ideal, and focus on in-house training to make up the difference? Considering the combined losses associated with unfilled positions and the expense of a candidate search, it is likely more cost-effective for many organizations.\n\nThis is something we’ve been discussing with employers across the region. In fact, the Philadelphia Fed has formed a partnership with Philadelphia Works, Social Finance, and a local company to change the way we prepare the local workforce for the future of work. The pilot is a unique public-private partnership, in which the public sector will provide customized training and the employer will repay the cost of that training once the outcomes are realized.\n\nThe reality of the tight labor market means that employers have to start thinking creatively and long term about how they’re going to address the gap between the skills they want and need and those available in the labor pool. What makes this project stand out is just that: The employer isn’t funding it through their foundation; it’s coming right out of the HR budget. It’s a business decision. And not only will they get an agile, trained workforce, but it adds to the city’s labor pool overall.\n\nIt’s my hope that more businesses in the region — and across the country — will begin to take another look at how they’re approaching training and hiring. This will be especially important as the baby boom generation continues its march into retirement and the importance of succession planning takes on new urgency across the professional spectrum.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up: The economy continues to do well. I continue to be happily patient in my outlook on raising rates and will monitor the data as they come in. And importantly, I hope that this point in the labor market’s history will prove to be the catalyst for employers to reconsider their approach to training, and what role they can play in arming people with the skills both employers and employees need.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today for a discussion that’s near and dear to my heart: Philadelphia’s path to inclusive and equitable prosperity. It’s an even bigger pleasure to be doing it in the company of Mayor Nutter, and if I can be even a fraction as engaging as he is in front of a crowd, I’ll consider it a job very well done.\n\nOne thing I can offer that Mayor Nutter won’t is the standard Fed disclaimer, delivered so you can be sure to blame absolutely no one but me for anything I say this morning: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThis next panel is on “Business, Equity, and the Future of Philadelphia,” which encompasses something that I think lies at the heart of the economic mobility conversation: The issues we’re discussing today are not issues that matter exclusively to the individuals, families, or neighborhoods they directly affect; they’re issues that matter to all of us, as a city, and they’re issues that affect our collective future.\n\nI was recently in Boston for a conference on economic mobility, and I referred to Philadelphia as “the city of champions,” which was brave, I know. Who says Fed officials don’t live on the edge? It was clearly an act of hubris anyway …\n\nBut what I meant — and clarified pretty quickly — was the reality everyone here is all too familiar with: That once again, we outpace the big city competition in terms of deep economic need.\n\nThat’s not a crown anyone wants to wear, but it’s a fact we have to acknowledge. I don’t, however, think we should let that reality convince us that nothing can be done to change it or that changes haven’t already been made. And while we have to face the economic facts of the matter, I’d argue that the focus of the discussion should be on the ways we can make a difference, and the work that is already being done, including by the people here today.\n\nAnd I do mean “we,” because economic mobility in Philadelphia — or anywhere else, for that matter — is something that affects everyone, whether they know it or not. Money may pay deference to neighborhood borders or city limits, but economics doesn’t. We all have skin in this game.\n\nCities thrive and grow when they attract investment, new businesses, and have a dynamic churn. Influencing factors range from infrastructure like transport, housing, and education to quality-of-life considerations like restaurants and cultural events. A huge influence is the local pool of talent, and when a significant portion of the population has been left behind — when they don’t have access to the training or educational opportunities to participate in that dynamism — it affects us all.\n\nThat’s something that I’m going to keep coming back to: the indispensable element of “we.”\n\nEverything about the road to changing Philadelphia’s future is steeped in a holistic imperative. It will take a multitude of people from a multitude of sectors taking a multitude of approaches to a multitude of issues to really move the needle. I don’t think that’s going to be easy and it definitely won’t fit on a bumper sticker ... but it is the ethos that underpins this conference and the work that our exceptional partners, speakers, and attendees today are already doing.\n\nThe title of that panel in Boston was “What Are the Barriers to Economic Mobility and for Whom?” and for me, the answer was pretty simple: all of it. This is a vast and intricate and messy economy, and there are too many ways for people to fall through its cracks. We can’t pick one factor and expect it to fix the whole; all those cogs have to move in unison. We need systems change.\n\nThat change can be hard, because the more complex the machine, the more facets there are to be tuned. Not to mention that the work is far too often siloed. So we need expertise from across the spectrum and we need the kind of thinking that brought us here today; this is how we figure out how to come together as a city to solve problems that affect us all.\n\nWe at the Philadelphia Fed have been lucky enough to work with partners not just across the city but across our entire District to think about how we best fit into and contribute to that process. It was one of the driving principles that led us to launch our Economic Growth & Mobility Project, or EGMP.\n\nEGMP focuses on the three foundational aspects of mobility: job creation — that is, stable, well-paid jobs that lead to financial security; workforce development — that is, education and training for people to get those jobs; and infrastructure, which includes everything from housing to transportation to broadband.\n\nThe Fed can’t make grants or finance projects; it’s not in our congressional remit. What we can do is bring people together and offer sound research.\n\nSo with the EGMP, we’re forming partnerships around the District, including here in Philadelphia, with communities that are engaged in addressing the systemic issues they face. That community leadership is essential because we can have the best research in the world, but we can’t replicate the knowledge that every community has of its own needs, character, and idiosyncrasies. What we contribute is getting the right people there — we call it “the convening power of the Fed” — and the research we’ve invested in and built over a sustained period of time. We’re calling these Research in Action Labs, and the outcomes aren’t just good for that one community; we can take those results, turn them into a toolkit, and hand it to the next city or town with a similar problem.\n\nIn northeastern Pennsylvania, for instance, we had one of the three foundational aspects: jobs at fulfillment centers. But we lacked another: infrastructure. The centers are located outside of town, and the region was built like most of America in the latter half of the 20th century, constructed to bring commuters from the suburbs and outskirts into the city, not the other way around. So we gathered a group of partners, and they came up with a collective set of solutions that worked for them — launching pilot programs, establishing a council on equitable transit, and making transit a priority in the area. The Fed can offer research, data, and support, but communities are the ones that understand their own unique needs. It was the all-hands-on-deck approach that made it successful; we couldn’t have just come in and dictated solutions, and we couldn’t have done it with limited voices around the table. We needed community leaders, businesses, workers; everyone has a perspective that the rest of us probably didn’t think about.\n\nThe result is that we’ve already had other areas with similar issues ask about how to replicate the program in their area, and now we can hand them a blueprint.\n\nAs another example, right here in Philadelphia, we’ve partnered with Philadelphia Works, Social Finance, and a local company to change the way we prepare the local workforce for the future of work. The pilot is a unique public-private partnership, in which the public sector will provide customized training and the employer will repay the cost of that training once the outcomes are realized.\n\nOne of the recurring themes in these discussions is that the high-level economic data look really good: low unemployment, high job creation. But that’s a national average that paves over the realities that we see every day in this city. Overall, the economy is doing really well, but that’s not a reality a lot of your clients and a lot of the people we meet with would recognize.\n\nThis partnership is really representative of the way those two perspectives on the same set of data can come together for a solution that works for everyone. The reality of the tight labor market means that employers have to start thinking creatively and long term about how they’re going to address the gaps in their workforces. This is what makes this project stand out: The employer isn’t funding it through its foundation; it’s coming right out of the HR budget. It’s a business decision. It’s a clear endorsement of the value of investing in Philadelphia and our people. Skills development is still too often seen as a social service, rather than an investment. And to be clear: It is an investment. Not just for the companies that need an agile, trained workforce, but for the city’s labor pool overall. And when those trainees become new hires, they also become contributors to the Philadelphia economy.\n\nTo sum up: something of an ode to Philadelphia. This is a great city. But we do face multiple issues that need to be addressed, and we can’t do it in isolation. The spirit in which this event was launched — the ethos underpinning much of the work we’re discussing today — is that we need every sector to participate and every problem challenged in unison. It’s a lot of work. But if anyone can do it, Philadelphia can. Even if we couldn’t repeat a Super Bowl win this year. There’s always next year …\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s always a pleasure to be in New York, and I want to thank President Williams and the entire team at the New York Fed for their hospitality.\n\nI also want to thank John for going first and saving me the extra time of delivering the full Fed disclaimer — I’ll just go with, “What he said.”\n\nI want to use my time today to talk a bit about the context of Investing in America’s Workforce, and how that research — and the gist of its findings — resonates across the work we’re doing at the Fed, both at our Bank in Philadelphia and across the System.\n\nJust last month, the Philadelphia Fed hosted our flagship community development conference, Reinventing Our Communities, or ROC, in Baltimore, in partnership with the Richmond Bank. Fed officials like to talk about how data-driven we are, and this applies to our CD work as well. Our focus in Philadelphia has been putting research into action to find sustainable approaches to economic growth, and ROC is about working at the intersection of research and practice.\n\nWe had some truly phenomenal speakers, but Joyce Bacon was a standout. And while almost everything about her is exceptional — her story, her presence, her work and commitment — she is, in one way, all too ordinary. And that is in her experience with some workforce programs.\n\nJoyce essentially went through training for a job that wasn’t there. Anyone involved in workforce development has seen something like what she experienced — or they’ve seen people train for jobs that disappear, jobs with no opportunity for growth, or jobs that don’t pay a living wage. It’s one of the pitfalls of a system that is all too often transactional in nature. It’s often called the “train and pray” model.\n\nThe happy turn to Joyce’s story is that she found her way to the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which does what everyone in this room would say is absolutely crucial to any successful training program: It works with employers, identifies skills that are in demand, and offers relevant training that prepares candidates both for jobs and for growth within their fields. They make that connection between local economic activity and job seekers.\n\nJoyce went straight into an entry-level position at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and within six months, she was promoted. But she was also very moved and motivated by her training experiences — both the good and the bad — and went back to West Philadelphia Skills Initiative as a coach. She comes in to talk to candidates, give them support, and let them know they can do it — a lot of them have gone through the same thing she did. She can tell them from experience that this time really is different; this is a place that doesn’t just train you for a job, it trains you for a career.\n\nAll too often, we’re spending time and energy on training that doesn’t address employers’ needs, leaving qualified talent on the sidelines. That doesn’t just waste money, it depletes people’s reserves of hope. We need more investment in programs like the one in West Philadelphia, that think about the evolution of the employment landscape. That’s even more important as technological advancement affects jobs and industries on a daily basis.\n\nWe recently published research on the likely effect of automation in both our District and in the U.S. We identified the jobs that were in danger, as well as assigning degrees of likelihood to their eventual disappearance. We also looked at the people doing those jobs, who would be hardest hit, and where new jobs would likely be created.\n\nOur conclusion? Almost one in five jobs in our District have a 95 percent or better chance of becoming automated, and the people most likely to be displaced are some of the economy’s most vulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger people, and workers in lower-skilled positions.\n\nSome people will be absorbed into new jobs, but there’s a risk that others will not.\n\nNow is the time to shift our thinking about how we train and prepare our workforce. That’s how we ensure that, instead of getting automated out of work, people have the skills to move into the jobs that arise from the change.\n\nIf you take Joyce’s far-too-common first training experience, add discouragement, and multiply it by a rapidly automating workforce, the results for the vast majority of both workers and employers run to negative territory. But we can change the outcome of the equation if we change how we approach the problem.\n\nInvesting in America’s Workforce\n\nA little over a year ago, many of us were in Austin for the release of the Investing in America’s Workforce (IAW) research. My remarks that day focused on the need to change the thinking about workforce development — and that in changing perspectives, we’d change behavior, and, ultimately, change the outcomes.\n\nOne year on, I’m delighted to say … that speech fixed it! Everyone can go home now!\n\nObviously, I’m kidding. And obviously, there’s still a lot of work to do, even on that first step of perspective change. Miraculously, no matter how many times I say to an audience that business has to start viewing workforce development as an investment, rather than a social service, it hasn’t moved the needle much. Even when every head is nodding in agreement.\n\nIt seems like common sense — in fact, it is common sense — that an investment in skills is an investment in the overall economy. But changing a commonly held assumption is almost as difficult as changing a deeply ingrained belief. And after the speeches and panels and plenary sessions, it is very, very easy to go back to business as usual.\n\nPerhaps if policy wonks were given to more sweeping oratory, we could change minds in a single speech. Unfortunately, my children tell me I’m not persuasive enough to make them change the channel … And this incredibly important, incredibly necessary, incredibly valuable work that you all do takes more than rhetorical flair. But with the continued commitment and effort everyone here puts in, we can chip away at the status quo until we’ve carved out a new, better reality.\n\nBack in Austin, I recapped the IAW findings on where and how various aspects of the system can change perspectives and approaches.\n\nOne of the messages that resonated throughout this work was the idea that everyone involved in workforce development should start thinking like investors looking for long-term rewards, rather than lenders thinking only about short-term risks.\n\nThe research showed that the public sector could be more effective by better aligning overlapping goals, such as workforce and economic development. They could also maximize benefits from investing in intermediaries that see the bigger picture — ones that don’t just train workers, but connect them to jobs, or train them with an eye on what the industry’s future needs will be.\n\nAs Joyce’s experience perfectly demonstrates, that can make a life-changing difference.\n\nFoundations, for their part, can take on the mantle of venture philanthropists, promoting innovation, collaboration, and capacity building.\n\nAnd employers should see their workers as assets to invest in, instead of line-item labor costs that can be limited or decreased. Our experts believe that the shift in outlook may result in a shift in behavior.\n\nThere are any number of ways that change could be beneficial, particularly if it means increased training opportunities for existing employees or professional development opportunities. It means a workforce with better skills, and creates entry-level openings for a new generation of talent, as existing employees move up the professional ladder. It will also likely save capital in the long run: Consider the accumulated cost of employee turnover versus investing a fraction of that in upskilling a current or potential worker.\n\nThat change in outlook could also encourage apprenticeship programs and other work-based training. We know from experience that programs that let people learn and earn are especially successful.\n\nOverall, if private sector organizations can train an investment lens on their approach to talent management, we’re more likely to see an increase in job quality, which is important. And, of course, the organizations themselves will likely see a huge benefit.\n\nOutcomes-Based Investments\n\nThat’s the perspective that informed a funding model we recently launched as part of the Economic Growth & Mobility Project. The model brings partners together to fundamentally rethink the way we fund workforce development — in both the public and private sectors — and how we pay for results.\n\nIt was born of, and is fueled by, two years of research and outreach by my team. It will utilize growing interest in new financial models to tap private sector investment in workforce development and provide 21st century digital skills to workers, ultimately moving its participants into the middle-skill jobs of the future.\n\nEarlier this year, we brought on Social Finance, a national leader in innovative Pay for Success projects, to help us think about how to make the case for employer investment in workforce development. We saw there were dollars on the table that could be better spent, and the missing capital could often be found in the money employers spend on recruitment, hiring, and training new workers.\n\nWe approached our local workforce development board, Philadelphia Works, to propose a new type of public-private partnership: one that would include employer investment but also provide feedback to the current workforce training programs. In this model, Philadelphia Works assumes the role of investor, providing the initial funding to launch the outcomes-based pilot training program.\n\nWith Philadelphia Works on board, we approached a large national technology employer that just happens to be headquartered in our fair city. It saw an opportunity to use this model to expand the local talent pool by building out the necessary technological training in specific fields, particularly for middle-skilled jobs with growing demands for technological proficiency.\n\nOutcomes-based finance, or Pay for Success, is not a new concept, of course. What makes this initiative different is that instead of issuing social impact bonds and having government paying for outcomes, the employer will pay the bill once the training meets its business needs and demonstrates return on investment. Repayments can then be recycled to pilot other projects and meet the needs of even more job seekers and employers in Philadelphia.\n\nIn August, Social Finance announced that it will provide technical assistance on the project’s structure, which will be funded by a grant from the White House Social Innovation Fund. The community development team at the Philadelphia Fed will assist with evaluating the project and analyzing return on investment to the employer. They will also design a toolkit so that other employers and cities can launch similar projects, including the ever-important wisdom of the lessons learned from this maiden voyage.\n\nThe first class of trainees will be announced in late spring of next year.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat makes this work especially resonant is that it’s the embodiment of what we learned last year in Austin. The message of Investing in America’s Workforce is that it’s time to change the way we look at things.\n\nThe new funding model is a way of changing our perspective on workforce development. And with a private sector partner taking the step to be the investor, we’re sending a message that workforce development truly is an investment, one that major employers are willing to make.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you.\n\nWhen I saw the agenda for today, I noticed that it covers a lot of what I wanted to address, which both assures me that I won’t wander too far afield and runs the risk of boring you with repetition. On one thing I’m sure to be original, however, and that is in delivering the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI have the privilege — or perhaps the curse — of a number of perspectives on higher education. I spent a long time in academia, both in teaching and administration; I was a first-generation college graduate; and I am the parent of three millennial children, one of whom recently finished graduate school.\n\nAcknowledging that I likely have some unconscious biases informed by each of these experiences — and some conscious ones that I’ll keep quiet — I’m going to speak today from the monetary policymaker’s perch and focus on the impact of higher education in the larger context of the American economy.\n\nToday I’d like to address the evolving nature of the labor market, the changing realities for higher education and employers, and the implications of the sum of those parts.\n\nBefore that, however, I’d like to set some parameters for my remarks. Specifically, what I see as the fundamental purpose of higher education. I want to dispense with the debate over its aim being either preparation for work or the intellectual pursuit of a more examined life because it creates a false sense of mutual exclusivity. Higher education should, absolutely, help prepare students for a career after graduation, and as technology advances at a more and more rapid pace, rethinking how we do that is essential. But that doesn’t mean abandoning the arts and humanities. In fact, as I’ll expand on later, I think it actually makes the case for their importance.\n\nAnd while the phrase “higher education” tends to elicit images of brick walls and ivy, it also consists of a range of post secondary options, from community colleges to technical schools to training programs, which are critically important and play a central role in an evolving labor market. All of these, whether they lean toward the practical or the philosophical, help students develop life skills, accumulate knowledge, and appreciate learning for its own sake.\n\nThe Changing Landscape of Work — Demographics\n\nThere are two overwhelming factors influencing higher education’s future: demographics and technology.\n\nDemography has exerted force on a number of areas of the economy, including labor force participation. The current participation rate is significantly lower than it was a decade ago, and research by my staff indicates that the trend will likely continue. As the baby boomers head into retirement, they’ll be the largest generation in history to do so. That will mean more people relying on Social Security and Medicare than ever before, and since they’re also living longer, they’ll be doing it for an extended period of time.\n\nThe millennial generation is actually a bit larger than the boomers, but even the oldest millennials are not quite in their prime earning years. So the share of that population paying into those programs is weighted toward the less affluent end of the spectrum.\n\nWe are also not seeing a great boom in population. As we all know, economics is full of equations that utilize the entirety of the Greek alphabet. But one of the most important rules is a simple sum: Growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity equals economic growth. With productivity also running low, the overall growth potential for the country is affected.\n\nI will make a note here that we could be miscalculating productivity. One of our economists, Leonard Nakamura, has done extensive research on how technology has affected our understanding of productivity, which is notoriously difficult to measure in the first place.\n\nWhat is not as difficult to measure, however, is population growth, and without more people, it will be harder for the economy to expand.\n\nTrends in demographics affect the people who have a stake in higher education in different ways.\n\nFrom the business end, we have employers who say they can’t find the right skills, businesses that say a dearth of workers is affecting their ability to grow, and HR departments struggling to fill vacancies for longer and longer periods of time.\n\nFor higher education, there are fewer people in seats due to the drop-off in the birth rate in the mid-1990s. A decrease in foreign students further impacts the bottom line, because they generally pay full tuition. They also make up a substantial portion of STEM and business study, and there are entire programs that don’t have enough domestic candidates to survive. If it becomes harder for foreign students to come, or if increased competition from abroad gives them incentive to stay home or go elsewhere, schools’ bottom lines suffer, and our economy overall misses out on U.S.-educated students in critical fields.\n\nThe Changing Landscape of Work — Technology\n\nThe other outsized force remaking the landscape of work is technology. It’s changing how we work, where we work, and, most importantly, what kind of work we do.\n\nAs I delve into this conversation, I want to put it in context, because the threats and opportunities inherent to this subject are very easily, and very often, mischaracterized.\n\nI’m an engineer by training and that lens doesn’t just give me endless ways to bore people about fluid mechanics; it frames subjects as one function of a whole. In this case, it places today’s technology at one point on a journey that humanity started when we first chiseled stone into tools.\n\nFrom ancient Egypt to the Internet Age, each advancement has laid the groundwork for the next, creating not just more ingenious invention, but faster innovation. This isn’t new; it’s the natural progression of humanity’s search to make life more comfortable and efficient. What is new is its pace.\n\nAlong this journey, jobs and industries have morphed and transformed, and they will continue to do so. Our challenge — and our opportunity — is how to train people to change with them. To do that, we have to understand how and where those changes are taking place.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed just published research that shows the likely effect of automation in our District and in the U.S. In addition to identifying jobs that are in danger of automation, we assigned degrees of likelihood to it happening. We also looked at the people doing those jobs, who would be hardest hit, and where new jobs would likely be created.\n\nWe found that almost one in five jobs in our District had a 95 percent or better chance of becoming automated. We also found that the people most likely to be displaced are some of the economy’s most vulnerable workers — women, people of color, younger people, and workers in lower-skilled positions.\n\nSome people will be absorbed into new jobs, but there’s a risk that others will not. Armed with this knowledge, we can think about how to connect those workers to training and new job opportunities.\n\nThe underpinning of this and other research is that, while we haven’t seen this exact kind of innovation before, we’ve seen the pattern. Throughout history, as jobs change, they’ve produced other jobs. With information on how and where that will happen, we can create systems that help workers, employers, and educators adapt.\n\nThe Intersection of Employers’ and Higher Education’s Needs\n\nThe changing landscape of the labor market offers an opportunity to assess how we’re preparing today’s students for tomorrow’s jobs.\n\nAgain, I am looking through that big-picture lens, because while technological fluency is important, I would caution against an overcorrection that disregards everything but the coding.\n\nAs we think about what skills will be necessary for the future, particularly in the context of technological advancements, we shouldn’t forget the value of the skills honed by the arts and humanities. Communication, critical thinking, interpretation of intent; the wide range of subjects in a classical liberal arts education forces the mind to shift gears, and that adaptability is crucial in a time of constant change.\n\nAs automation continues its march, it also lays bare the human capabilities that cannot be artificially reproduced. Much of what automation has already displaced — and the industries in which its impact will continue to grow — are repetitive actions and rote knowledge that robots do better and more efficiently than us. Artificial intelligence in its current form is not akin to a self-aware Hal in 2001; its output is limited to the things we input. Our comparative human advantages of creativity and individuality cannot be duplicated. At least not yet. If that happens, disregard everything I just said …\n\nI was preceded on the agenda by a panel on what higher education needs and wants from business and government, and I’m followed by its counterpart, what business and government ask of higher ed.\n\nI actually think those wants and needs intersect.\n\nThe inevitability of continued technological evolution will necessitate two things: a core set of skills that can evolve with the market and a shift to constant training and continuing education.\n\nProfessions will need continual upskilling, whether it’s to keep up with industry standards or just learn the office’s new software, while those preparing for the workforce will need both proficiency in current programs and to develop skills that will help them adapt with the technology as it evolves.\n\nFrom the employers’ end, that means investing in the workforce and committing to lifelong learning. Simply replacing outdated skills with new ones just isn’t efficient or cost-effective, and it may not even be enough — they’ll need workers who can adapt to a dynamic and regularly changing environment, and that takes investment in people.\n\nEducators will also need to consider new models, not just because technology is forcing it, but because they’ll be in a position to offer the lifelong learning that workers need.\n\nRethinking Models and Mindsets\n\nIn rethinking models, we should also rethink mindsets because there are some entrenched beliefs that we need to change if we’re going to successfully adapt.\n\nI just made the case for the importance of the humanities, and I believe in their value. But I also think that we place too great an emphasis on traditional, four-year education, particularly when it comes to employment.\n\nThe other components of higher education I mentioned earlier — community colleges, technical schools, training programs — are equally valid sources of skilled workers and, in some instances, better suited to employers’ needs. A bachelor’s is not the only educational path to the skills employers want, though it’s too often a requirement.\n\nWhen my staff was researching “opportunity occupations” — jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require a four-year degree — they found something interesting. Despite not requiring a degree, employers started asking for one during the slow recovery, when higher unemployment created more competition. We’ve seen that in a lot of sectors, and, while it’s retreated to a large extent, the degree inflation still exists in some places. I’ve been shown website galleries of some of the more egregious job ads: degree required, master’s preferred, previous experience … $7.50 an hour, no benefits.\n\nThat misalignment of requirements and the actual needs of the job perpetuates the veneration of pedigrees over skills, which is a mindset I think we need to change. But it also risks employers missing out on the right candidate.\n\nThis reconsideration of skills and degrees is more important than ever. We have a labor market with very little slack left, and the most common refrain I hear from employers is that they can’t fill the jobs they have. Those demographic and technological pressures are unlikely to recede.\n\nI was recently in Lancaster, PA, where a business owner told me they can’t get enough workers for assembly line work. It’s a straightforward job, just taking pretzels off the belt and putting them in boxes. They’re paying $17 an hour. And those are the jobs that don’t require training.\n\nFor higher education, there is an opportunity to rethink new partnerships and models that could also bring in more revenue while, at the same time, better responding to the needs of business and industry.\n\nThis is important for many institutions as demographic forces are likely to shift an increasing share of local, state, and federal budgets toward retirement benefits, pensions, and health care. States’ proposed budgets are generally calling for increased spending in fiscal 2019 and there is attention to higher education. However, the overall growth is smaller than historical averages, and there are many competing interests.1\n\nAs higher education institutions of all types look at their balance sheets and as consolidations and mergers increase across the sector, there are both opportunities and risks.\n\nI know from experience that change can be a daunting proposal, especially at institutions that are historically or culturally resistant to it. And the suspicion is understandable, particularly if there’s a fear that quality of education is being sacrificed for revenue streams, and when too much of the debate frames education’s focus as an either-or proposition.\n\nThere are, however, new and creative ways to adapt to the needs of a changing landscape without surrendering the essential characteristics that make all of our postsecondary paths of study exceptional.\n\nThere are great models that both employers and educators can consider. Some of the most innovative have come out of community colleges. They range from working with individual businesses to give credit for on-site work to competency-based bachelor’s degrees for experienced professionals.\n\nOur research on apprenticeships has also highlighted some exceptional models; we visited the Philly Shipyard last year, and the participants we met ranged from a woman with an M.F.A. who’s become their star welder to a man in his 40s whose Facebook page is overwhelmed by friends angling for the next opening. But just as importantly, we’ve seen apprenticeships emerge in finance, IT, and health care, areas we don’t traditionally associate with a model that dates back to the Code of Hammurabi.\n\nPeter Cappelli, who heads up the Center for Human Resources at Wharton, has done research on the most important lines on a recent graduate’s résumé; number one is internships. Employers are looking for experience. There are any number of partnerships that could occur both across and within sectors that could benefit everyone involved. This is especially important when a good portion of internships are still unpaid, which puts lower-income students at a disadvantage. While the share of paid internships has been rising steadily over the past several years, in 2017, the unpaid ones still accounted for more than 43 percent.2\n\nEducation’s Impact on the Economy\n\nThe pull of demographic forces doesn’t just affect labor force participation; it plays a role in dynamism as well. The U.S. economy has historically been dynamic. By that I mean the standard economics definition of turnover in businesses, jobs, and worker mobility, rather than innovative and energetic, though that’s certainly apropos. Dynamism has been on the decline for the past 30 years or so. If we want to keep the economy from stagnating, we need as many participants in the workforce as possible.3 We also need a workforce that is trained and adaptive to change.\n\nThere are real consequences to the skills and labor shortage. We often talk about it in broad terms — the economic reality that businesses can’t expand and overall dynamism falls. That, in itself, is obviously a pressing issue, but zeroing in on specific sectors highlights the potential for ripple effects.\n\nTake health care as an example. I was recently in Wellsboro, in the far northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, meeting with business and community leaders to discuss their approaches to economic growth. One of them runs a hospital, and despite offering higher salaries than Philadelphia does for doctors and health-care workers, they’re struggling to recruit.\n\nMultiply that by cities and towns across the country facing similar skills shortages and add to that the retirement of the boomers that I mentioned earlier. Roughly 10,000 people turn 65 each day in the U.S., a trend that started in 2011 and is likely to continue for another decade.4 Consider additionally that health care currently accounts for almost 18 percent of the economy and is on track to make up 20 percent by 2025.5 It puts the need for skilled workers in perspective.\n\nThe Opportunity (of a Lifetime)\n\nI actually think we have an incredible opportunity, one that doesn’t come around often. We have a labor force with very little slack left, and there is a confluence of discussions about the future of higher education, the importance of skills, and the impact of technology on our lives. It’s the perfect time to see these all in the frame of the bigger picture and consider what it means for the next five, 10, 20 years.

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for your warm welcome.\n\nI hope you will all agree that we’ve had three exceptional, thought-provoking days in Baltimore. Our time together has been packed with compelling speakers, new ideas, and challenging questions.\n\nAnd now it seems that it is my job to summarize what we have experienced but not tamp down the energy and excitement that has been generated during our time here.\n\nBut first, let me acknowledge the incredible work that Noelle St.Clair and the entire Federal Reserve staff did in creating this event. We all know that conferences like this take a lot of effort, creativity, and attention to detail, not to mention flexibility and good humor. Please join me in thanking everyone involved in making this week a reality: our speakers, tour guides, and partners. You all have sacrificed sleep and time with your loved ones to ensure this event came off without a hitch. Thank you.\n\nAnd a special thanks to our host city of Baltimore and President Tom Barkin and his team at the Richmond Fed as well as President Ron Daniels of Johns Hopkins University and the 21st Century Cities Initiative.\n\nWhat you heard inside this hotel and what you saw outside these walls have hopefully armed you with new insights and ideas to carry forward as you return home.\n\nI want to take my time with you this afternoon to deliver some brief remarks that may be slightly different than many of you might have expected from a Federal Reserve Bank president. Rather than focus on data and economic models, I want to talk to you about the need for and the power of systems change.\n\nAnd, while this speech may be a little different, I still have to issue the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I’m expressing here today are my own and do not reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nPerspectives on Opportunity\n\nThe Fed is first and foremost a data-driven institution that relies on objective research to inform policy decisions. That said, our understanding must be informed by the real experiences of those who make up the economy — real people who work, spend, save, and invest in the many ways that drive our local and national economy.\n\nWhile the data and strategies shared over the past three days have provided valuable insight, I, for one, have found inspiration in the stories. From the personal journeys of Due Quach to Zachary Wood, these perspectives on opportunity have illustrated the power of narrative to shed light on issues and bring data to life.\n\nI believe the best policy happens at this intersection of national data and local realities — at the intersection between research and practice.\n\nTo that end, one of the most important parts of my job is traveling around the District and hearing from people. We hear stories of community stakeholders — from bankers to laborers, young students to the retired, from the unemployed to the self-employed. We hear stories from urban to rural communities across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.\n\nThrough our travels, we are reminded that, even as the economy at large prospers, people in many communities face real economic challenges.\n\nWe have heard about increasing rates of poverty in suburban communities, the continuing movement of educated workers out of rural areas, rental housing challenges in cities, and the economic impacts of the opioid epidemic in all of these places.\n\nI’ve learned so much from these interactions, and I value the insights people share about how the economy is working — or in some cases, not working — for them.\n\nWe’ve spent the past three days looking at incredibly innovative approaches to fixing entrenched problems. We have seen examples of investing not only financial capital but also our collective human, social, and physical capital in order to truly maximize opportunities for more Americans and foster greater economic mobility. We have heard the call to action for strategies that move us beyond transactional to transformational change.\n\nWhat is clear from these stories, and the data that support them, is that in order for this to happen, there is a need for real systems change. These stories are, in fact, where systems change can begin.\n\nReinventing Our Systems\n\nNow, systems change can sound like a heady, overwhelming task — it’s too big, it’s somebody else’s problem, it’s beyond my control. But I would argue that we all have a role to play in systems change.\n\nSystems change is about understanding what is working and what it isn’t, being willing to question what is underneath, and knowing that cosmetic repairs will never be successful if we don’t reexamine the whole structure. This is work we all can do, and I fundamentally believe this is work we’ve started here together over the past three days.\n\nAll systems require continual assessment to ensure that the assumptions we make, and the truths we hold to be absolute, still make sense as the world around us evolves.\n\nAs a few of you may know, I am an engineer by training. One of my first jobs as an engineer was working on the New York City subway system in the 1980s. Many nights were spent walking deep into subway tunnels first opened in 1904 looking for cracks and damage, suggesting repairs for a crumbling system and trying to avoid New York rats. I can assure you this work was as glamorous as it sounds. As the city is contemplating new improvements, I am sure it is uncovering some of the same structural issues I witnessed first-hand three decades ago.\n\nLike those outdated and aging subway lines, some of the systems that impact our economy also need reinventing. In many cases, we have been putting bandages on larger structural problems, covering things that are fundamentally flawed.\n\nYet, history has handed us an opportunity to fundamentally alter a system of practices and perspectives that may no longer be serving our best interests and needs.\n\nWe have a labor market with very little slack left. We have employers who say they can’t find the right skills, businesses that say a dearth of workers is affecting their ability to grow, and HR departments that are struggling to fill vacancies.\n\nAt the same time, my office sits in a city with a 5.9 percent unemployment rate and an astounding 25.7 percent poverty rate, and we gather today in a metropolis with similar disparities, at 6.5 percent unemployment and a 22.2 percent poverty rate.\n\nThis is why the location of this conference is so important — in Baltimore as in Philadelphia — we have a unique moment in time when we can harness the economic changes happening and ask the challenging questions: How are we making sure our growth and revitalization benefits everyone?\n\nIf we are to prosper locally and nationally, we need to create systems that promote regional growth and work for more communities.\n\nAs we reflect on the magnitude of the task at hand, it is essential to remember that systems are made by people, and therefore can be changed if it is collectively determined that they are no longer serving us. This requires, however, that we bring a sense of intentionality and urgency to reinventing these systems into something better.\n\nChallenging Our Assumptions — Racial Equity\n\nIn order to change systems, we need to challenge our assumptions. At this moment, this means we need to talk about the real disparities we see in our economy. We are all familiar with the data highlighting differences in poverty rates, median household income, and homeownership by race.\n\nIn many ways, these disparities are exactly why many of us are in this room today: We are trying to provide pathways to opportunity for communities that have been left behind. Let’s consider the racial wealth gap. In 2016, white families had the highest level of median family wealth at $171,000. Yet black families’ median net worth was only $17,600 and Hispanic families’ $20,700.1\n\nIn order to understand what is driving this disparity, we need to look beyond the problems we see today and challenge the systems that brought us here. Research from our colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that racial disparities in economic security persist due to deeply rooted structural and systemic factors.2\n\nIt is our job to question how those systems continue to perpetuate racially disparate outcomes that ultimately limit our economic potential.\n\nSeveral of you attended the Racial Equity Learning Lab we hosted yesterday. Participants walked away with a toolkit to help them analyze the racial impact of their work. They were also challenged to think more deeply: What will you do to ensure your policies and programs are not perpetuating disparate impact? How will your work explicitly address these ongoing challenges?\n\nWhile we strive to invest in opportunity, we also need to challenge our assumptions that systems are providing that opportunity equally to everyone. As community development professionals, you have an important role to play here. This will require a close examination of the systems related to homeownership, access to capital, small business, employment, and education. And it will require building systems that make equity a priority rather than an afterthought.\n\nI hope we can each walk away from this conference challenging some of these assumptions, laying the groundwork to help us reinvent opportunities in a rapidly changing economy.\n\nThe highly transitional nature of the economy makes this work even more important.\n\nReinvent Opportunities — Automation Report\n\nMachines and technology have already disrupted so much of how we work today, and future automation is only going to disrupt labor markets further.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed recently took a close look at the employment landscape of the Fed’s Third District. We assessed the likely effects of automation on jobs across sectors and geographies, including which jobs are at risk of disappearing or changing dramatically. We also analyzed the populations that will be hardest hit by these changes and where jobs will likely be created to absorb displaced workers.\n\nIn this research, which we are excited to release today, we found that close to one-fifth of jobs in the Third District had a 95 percent or higher chance of automating. And we found that those most likely to be impacted are those in the most vulnerable positions in our economy — women, people of color, younger people, and lower-skilled workers.\n\nThe research shows us that automation and technology could increase the inequality we are seeing in our economy, but that doesn’t have to be the case.\n\n“The robots are coming.” In fact, they have been here for a while. However, what happens as a result is not inevitable. Our research shows that we can make decisions to reinvent our workforce and economic development systems to make sure that more people can benefit from these changes.\n\nDisrupt Norms — Outcomes-Based Finance Model\n\nIn order to do that, we need to be bold enough to disrupt norms — particularly around funding.\n\nJust last month, I had the opportunity to tour Tec Centro, a workforce training center that offers bilingual training to prepare local job seekers for the more than 12,000 job vacancies in Lancaster County. I spoke with students in the Certified Nursing Assistant (CAN) program whose wages will more than double in as little as three months when they finish their training.\n\nPrograms like these can transform lives, and they are essential to the growth of our regional economies. Yet, so many of these programs are unable to scale and meet the demands of our current economy.\n\nThat being said, as we heard from our previous panel, it would be impossible to “grant-make” our way out of this. Likewise, we can’t solve the workforce dilemma through public programs alone.\n\nThat is why I’m excited to announce a new pilot that facilitates private sector investment in workforce development. The Philadelphia Fed team in partnership with our city’s workforce investment board and a major Philadelphia-based national tech employer are creating a new outcomes-based funding model for workforce development.\n\nWith the guidance of thought-leaders like Social Finance, this new model will align incentives for every stakeholder.\n\nThe program will identify workers in jobs at risk of automation and train them in digital skills, ones that will be useful immediately after training but will also arm them with skills for the future.\n\nOutcomes-based finance, or Pay for Success, is, of course, not a new concept. What makes this initiative different is that, instead of issuing social impact bonds and having government paying for outcomes, the employer will pay the bill once the training meets its business needs and demonstrates return on investment.\n\nIf it’s successful, this will be the first program of its kind to have the private sector paying for outcomes delivered via public workforce funding. Repayments can then be recycled to pilot other projects and meet the needs of even more jobs seekers and employers in Philadelphia. This will send a strong message to employers that workforce development is an investment, not a social service.\n\nThis is a new kind of partnership, the kind that fundamentally disrupts systems and the ways we have been doing things. And I think it will help hit the reset button on the relationship between the public and private sectors and the ways they work together.\n\nMost importantly, this is an idea that can be adopted across industries. To say that this excites me would be a huge understatement, as you can tell.\n\nWe hope that by challenging assumptions about the impact of automation and by disrupting the norms of how the private sector invests in workforce development, we can reinvent opportunities for those who could most benefit from the growing economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe could not gather with you all here without acknowledging the great Jeremy Nowak, who served as chair of the board of the Philadelphia Fed for a number of years. I know that so many of you here in this room knew Jeremy. I’m told that, at his memorial service in August, a lot of the stories people told publicly and privately that day were about how often Jeremy had yelled at them but how much they loved him for it. He was that kind of guy: impatient and passionate. He spent his career at the intersections of capital and people, of data and anecdote, of reason and emotion. He asked hard questions, he challenged assumptions, he disrupted norms, and he reinvented opportunities. Every day. And he wanted all of us to do the same thing. Every day.\n\nThe good news is that you are already leading this work.\n\nMy challenge to you today — as Jeremy would have challenged us — is to not forget the role that you can all play in fundamentally changing the systems and structures that limit opportunity.\n\nSo, let us return home and continue to do the hard work and ask the hard questions and demand better answers from ourselves and from others.\n\nAnd let us never forget that our work to reinvent our communities matters — for countless individuals and for our larger economy.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Lisa J.

            "content": "While it’s always a pleasure to be in Dallas, it’s particularly enjoyable to be in such exceptional company, so thank you. I’ll keep my opening remarks brief so we can move on to the discussion, but I do want to use a few minutes for some rhetorical housekeeping.\n\nFirst, I’ll set some parameters for how I view today’s topic in a wider context. I’ll discuss what I think are the most important issues arising from changes in the labor market. Finally, I want to consider how we take the next necessary steps and outline what I think it means for all of us — whether academic, policymaker, or both — and what it portends for the wider economy.\n\nSince I’m going first, I’ll give the standard Fed disclaimer in full so Mary and Sam can feel free to shout “disclaimer ditto” in lieu of the full spiel: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe first thing I’d like to do is address the subject of this conference: technology-enabled disruption. Coming from an engineering background and having a hand in both the physical and dismal sciences, AI and machine learning hold particular fascination for me.\n\nI am more than happy to recite chapter and verse on the revolutions emerging from labs across the globe, from universities across the Philadelphia Fed’s District to Mary’s backyard in Silicon Valley to any number of international hubs.\n\nBut I also want to be sure that we place it in context, looking not just at today’s advances but at technology’s impact throughout human history. Because whenever we venture down this particular path of discussion, it becomes apparent that, much like beauty, disruption is often in the eye of the beholder. And at the risk of sounding like an apostate, I think we’re merely at a particularly interesting leg of a very long journey.\n\nI don’t think the robots are coming for us, and I doubt very much that human workers will become obsolete.\n\nLooking at the forest as well as the trees is an essential exercise in any discussion of how we adapt to change. Technological advancement has impacted human existence since our ancestors first hewed tools from stone, then abandoned them for those wrought from iron and then bronze.\n\nAnd each step from the Industrial Revolution to the Internet age has taken us further along the path. This excursion has certainly accelerated in pace, and change now comes at a much faster rate than we’ve previously experienced.\n\nWhat’s vitally important now is how we keep pace. How does our workforce adapt, how do industries keep up, how do we ride the wave instead of letting it crash over us?\n\nWhen I consider the effects on the automotive industry, for instance, I see a much more dramatic impact from the computerization of the dashboard than from driverless cars.\n\nThat fundamental change to the family car means today’s mechanics need a set of computer skills that would’ve been unthinkable a decade or two ago. And even if the entire fleet of our nation’s trucks and taxis are eventually replaced by autonomous vehicles, we’ll still need someone to fix them.\n\nAnd while some of that will be done by robotics, each step in this evolution involves human skill and interaction.\n\nThat evolution is important because, as we move from point A to point B, people are a fundamental part of the equation. I see technology not as ushering in the demolition of entire sectors but as the compelling case for why we need to reassess how we train and educate our workforce.\n\nThere is no question that some of that emphasis will be on computer skills on all points across the employment spectrum. Both fast food workers and home health aides, for instance, are increasingly required to have data-entry capabilities and a fluency in basic systems.\n\nHowever, I also view the growing influence of technological disruptors as laying bare the advantages of our humanity that cannot be reproduced.\n\nMuch of what automation has already displaced, and the industries in which its impact will continue to grow, are repetitive actions and rote knowledge that robots do better and more efficiently than we do.\n\nBut there are things machines can’t do, and those are the things that make us quintessentially human. The inevitability of continued technological evolution should be accompanied by policies and initiatives that train our current and incoming workforce to both master current requirements and instill the agility to adapt to change.\n\nIt should also — at the risk of being heretical — recognize the comparative human advantages of creativity and individuality that even the most advanced AI is far from duplicating.\n\nThis is increasingly important as employers face a dearth of workers with the necessary skills to staff their current ranks, let alone their future ones. While there is some academic debate over the extent of the skills gap, research by my staff shows its clear existence.\n\nAnd with the caveat that “data” is not the plural of anecdote, it’s also the number one issue I hear from our business contacts both in my District and across the country. I hear the same from colleagues.\n\nThat gap will likely become starker as the labor market tightens and the labor force shrinks. With demographic influences poised to push labor force participation rates further downward over the next several years, the chasm could widen.\n\nThat means asking employers, educators, HR professionals, job seekers, and the rest of us to throw out some ingrained habits and assumptions and adopt a new perspective.\n\nTo effectively move toward that future, and in some cases, catch up to the present, it is imperative that we rethink education and training. It’s often the case that when we adapt to meet change, the pendulum swings too far in one direction, abandoning some fundamental strengths.\n\nSo, I want to make clear that I view this as an opportunity to both increase our technological dexterity and double down on the areas that foster creativity, like the arts and humanities.\n\nThe first shift is perhaps the most difficult because it requires a culture change. We have to stop viewing education, particularly postsecondary education, as one-size-fits-all.\n\nNot everyone wants or needs a four-year degree, and it’s not necessary to get one right away. We have to not only increase access and availability to other options, with alternative pathways and training programs, but to view them as smart, laudable choices, equal in merit to their purely academic counterparts.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed has an Economic Growth & Mobility Project (EGMP) that focuses in large part on workforce development, and my team’s work on “learn and earn” pathways has shown their promise. That’s everything from apprenticeships to high school models that prepare students for work directly after graduation without sacrificing the central curriculum.\n\nThey offer the opportunity after graduation to enter a profession while either taking college courses, preparing for future education, or just jumping straight onto a career path.\n\nWhat’s important about these programs, particularly the apprenticeships, is that they’re not confined to the traditional trades.\n\nWe’re seeing them in everything from IT to medicine, strong areas of job growth and career opportunities, especially in my District. My staff has also done some very interesting work with colleagues in the Reserve System on what they call “opportunity occupations” — jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require a traditional four-year degree.\n\nTheir work has identified not just the occupations themselves but their geographical spread, which could be a resource for creating pipelines. Other researchers are additionally looking at job-posting data sets to better determine what skills are most sought after, whether there is any regional variation, how long certain jobs go unfilled, and why.\n\nThe next phase in opportunity occupations research is looking at how skills can transfer between sectors and industries, and here we come back to the quintessentially human aspects of work that are irreplaceable by machine.\n\nThey’re looking at those core capabilities that can move someone from, say, an associate-level job in IT to a manager position in health care.\n\nThis is something that’s profoundly important, and it also reminds us that sometimes, supplanting human expertise with technology — for instance, by using keyword software — could actually be harming employers’ chances of finding qualified candidates.\n\nThis speaks to some extent to the need for employers to rethink their requirements and how they meet them. In the aftermath of the recession, they had their pick of a crowded labor pool. In a tighter market, where the wish-list candidates are fewer and in more demand, they may need to reconsider what is truly important to fill an open position. That could prompt an overall rethink of how we recruit and retain our own workforces, which could be a catalyst for change.\n\nOther research underway in EGMP aims to quantify the return on investment for employer-linked training programs. One of the things they’ve seen over and over again is the predisposition to see workforce development as a social program rather than an investment. Even though, in many cases, the simple math of a single investment in a workplace training program is vastly more cost effective than the combined expense of an extended recruiting period for an open job that represents a productivity loss while it goes unfilled.\n\nThis could be a truly important plank in bridging the skills gap.\n\nI’ll stop there and hand over the reins or, I suppose, the keys to the driverless car, as the case may be.\n\nTo recap, with apologies to Mark Twain, I think reports of the death of human jobs are greatly exaggerated and that technological advancement in fact offers an opportunity to disrupt our own modes of education and training. I’m looking forward to my fellow panelists’ assessments and to the discussion today.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome. It’s a pleasure to be at Saint Joseph’s University.\n\nToday I’d like to discuss every college senior’s favorite subject: student loans. Not just as they pertain to the individual, but the impact they, and other facets of the education landscape, have on the U.S. economy overall, and why the subject is one for every American to consider.\n\nBefore I get to that, I want to take care of two housekeeping issues. The first is an introduction to Fed protocol, and that is the issuance of a standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System. The second is an introduction to the Fed itself.\n\nI promise it will be short, and no, it won’t be on the test.\n\nFed Overview\n\nThe Federal Reserve stands out among the world’s central banks for its decentralized structure. How do you decentralize a central bank? You establish 12 regional Banks across the country that are independent of, but work alongside, the Fed’s Board of Governors, located in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat structure was established 100-plus years ago to ensure that the realities on the ground in a vast and varied economy would be recognized when national policy is made. It was a prescient decision, as the landscape of the country has become ever more diverse and eclectic in the intervening century. The concerns of the residents of the Philadelphia Fed’s District are often different than, for instance, the Dallas Fed’s. So when we all meet to decide policy, which we do every six weeks or so, each of us walks into that discussion with a unique perspective. We’re the voice for our regions.\n\nWhile the Fed was created by and is answerable to Congress, it is an independent entity, which shields it from political pressure. This is a crucial element to safeguarding the country’s economy. You obviously don’t want people making cosmetic decisions in the short term for the sake of political expediency. You want people who look at the medium and long-term implications of their actions and make determinations based on data. You want policy wonks. You might not want to hang out with us at a party, but you’re probably pretty happy with us relentlessly analyzing the data on your behalf.\n\nThe Fed has a host of responsibilities, from providing currency to banks to undertaking research to working with local communities to encourage economic growth, mobility, and stability. But the most well-known and primary function of the Fed is conducting monetary policy in pursuit of our dual mandate, which is price stability and maximum employment. Or, inflation and jobs.\n\nWe want inflation to be slow and steady — our current target rate is 2 percent — to keep pace with growth without devaluing the money in your bank account. By maximum employment, we mean, in an overly simplified nutshell, that if you’re looking for a job you can find one relatively easily. We make no guarantees that it’ll be your dream job, but in a strong labor market, a paycheck shouldn’t be hard to come by.\n\nBecause people move in and out of the workforce all the time, unemployment will never be zero. When you graduate, for instance, and start looking for jobs, you’re considered unemployed from the time you start looking to the time you find one. A certain level of churn is healthy.\n\nAs for what’s ideal, there’s a sort of magic number for unemployment called the “natural rate.” It changes depending on the makeup of the economy, and we never really know what the exact number is until it’s in the rearview mirror, though we do have estimates. The current unemployment rate, 4.1 percent, is at or below the natural rate in my own view.\n\nThere are a host of other factors we look at, including the labor force participation rate, how frequently people quit jobs, how long jobs stay open, and how many net new jobs are created, just to name a few.\n\nThe Changing Labor Force\n\nSo, what does this all have to do with student loans?\n\nA fairly tight labor market means that jobs are relatively abundant, which in turn, means fewer excess workers. That’s great if you’re looking for a job, but less so if you’re a business that wants to expand. Additionally, if most of the potential workforce is already off the sidelines, it means the labor force itself is unlikely to grow significantly. One of the more straightforward rules of the dismal science is that economic growth is basically growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity. Productivity growth is currently quite low, so if the labor market can’t keep pace, economic growth will suffer.\n\nUltimately, the strength of our workforce, and its trajectory, depends on a couple of factors, and one of those is how — and how well — it’s educated.\n\nSo I want to talk today about the ways the education system, particularly post-secondary education, affect the U.S. labor market.\n\nLike all things, the current state of the American workforce has to be taken in context, and there are some important facets to consider in today’s market.\n\nFirst is the effect of technological advancement on the landscape. To be sure, this has been a factor since humanity first set out a rudimentary economy based on barter and trade millennia ago. The transition from Stone Age to Bronze Age to Iron Age reflects an evolution of the technology of those times. Fast forwarding to more recent events, the introduction of the steam engine, the assembly line, and refrigerated transport were all their own game-changing technologies that fundamentally altered the world’s business and economic composition.\n\nBut whereas we once saw those technologies advance at centuries’ or decades’ paces, we are now in the throes of advancement that appears to upend industries on an almost constant basis.\n\nIn that sense, there’s more change within jobs and industries, and more need for continual retraining and upskilling. As the labor market has steadily improved, one of the problems that’s arisen is a mismatch of skills. That creates an issue when employers want to expand their businesses but can’t fill the jobs they already have.\n\nAnd the faster an industry changes, the more that can affect the skills gap. Auto mechanics, for instance, now need a level of computer knowledge that’s a world away from what would’ve been required 20, or even 10 years ago. Think about how much of the dashboard is digitized and compare that with a car that was manufactured in the ’90s. Or have one of your professors describe it. Ask them to tell you about something called a “CD player.”\n\nAs the labor market continues to get tighter and tighter, workers with specific skills will likely be harder and harder to find. And if businesses can’t fill the jobs they have now, they’re not going to be able to expand.\n\nThe second dynamic is demographics, which, again, has been a factor throughout history, but is different now than at any point before. As a parent of three millennial children, I am acutely aware that the younger generation feels unfairly maligned. But for this particular phenomenon — one that will put distinct pressure on the economy and the workforce — you can direct blame firmly at “the olds.”\n\nThe baby boomers will be the largest generation to date to head into retirement. They are also living longer, which, as a boomer myself, I am very much in favor of. But it does mean an unprecedented number of people living out their post-working lives for longer than we’re used to. That means more people benefiting from Medicare, more people drawing Social Security, and more people needing assistance with everything from day-to-day care to transportation. Those programs are funded in large part by the American workforce, and that assistance will require more workers at a time when there are fewer and fewer left to come off the sidelines and in fields that require special education and skills.\n\nFinally, there is the price of education. I’m sure you’ve heard, from time to time, that things are much easier now than they were in our day. We had to pore through textbooks, while you have Wikipedia. We took pictures with film and couldn’t make them look better after. We walked to school in knee-deep snow. Up a hill. Both ways.\n\nBut on this count, the times are decidedly working against your favor.\n\nMillennials are much more likely than older generations to have taken out a student loan.1 And both the sticker price of tuition and the discounted rate have risen faster than incomes over the past 20 years. At the same time, state funding for higher education has been steadily diminishing. That was both a factor in the rise of tuition — though certainly not its entire cause — and will likely continue to get worse as those demographic trends I mentioned continue to play out. Local, state, and federal budgets will be even more pressed as funds increasingly go toward retirement benefits, pensions, and health care.\n\nAs tuitions have risen, and more people have started going to college, both the share of students who take out loans and the average amount of debt borrowed have grown substantially. It is now a larger proportion of consumer debt than auto loans or credit cards; in fact, it’s second only to mortgages.\n\nThe Impact of Student Debt\n\nThat reality doesn’t just affect the people holding the debt — though it’s obviously a significant issue for them — it affects the wider economy in a variety of ways.\n\nFirst, the burden is starting to spread across generations within families. Second, it is affecting people’s life decisions after school. And third, it can exacerbate income disparity. All of these play a role in the country’s economic future.\n\nTaking those in turn: first, the multigenerational effects. Research shows that in the decade leading up to 2015, the number of adults over the age of 60 who took on student debt fully quadrupled. Roughly three-quarters of those people assumed that debt on behalf of children or grandchildren.2 That means a substantial number of people are holding debt who are either living on — or headed toward — fixed incomes in their retirement. Since those golden years are likely to last longer than their parents’ did, they’re also more likely to encounter increased care costs, which creates added pressure. Not only is this a financial issue for families to contend with, it increases the likelihood of default.\n\nSecond, the looming specter of debt appears to be affecting areas of the economy that are fundamental to growth. Research by the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute, as well as others in the Federal Reserve System, shows that student debt is affecting both small business formation and homeownership rates.3,4 There’s a narrative out there that millennials don’t want to buy houses. But what if they don’t feel that buying is an option?\n\nCarrying a student loan burden in itself can both affect early career choices5 and dissuade people from making another investment. But it also affects the ability to do so. Buying a house means having a down payment, and it’s difficult to accumulate a down payment when you’re paying off loans. It also means getting a mortgage, which requires good credit, and that credit is affected by the debt you carry. The ratio of your outstanding loans to your current income is one factor lenders assess, and meeting an acceptable bar can be especially difficult for people in their first few jobs out of college, when salaries aren’t as high as later in your career. It can also prove difficult for people in careers that pay less overall but are incredibly valuable, like teaching or social work.\n\nStudent debt is also a different animal than say, auto loans or mortgages, because it’s non-dischargeable. That is, even if you file bankruptcy, you can’t get rid of it. This is rooted in a concern that people will look to unfairly dismiss their debt, even if they have sufficient incomes. I should note that research by my staff and others does not find evidence to support that theory.6\n\nAll in all, research by the Fed’s Board of Governors finds that in the first five years after school, a person’s chance of owning a home drops by 1 to 2 percentage points for every 10 percent of student debt a person holds.7\n\nUltimately, if the ability of our younger generations to participate in the economy is adversely affected, so, overall, is our economy.\n\nFinally, there’s the issue of parity and access to higher education. This question of access is important because the data show that the investment is absolutely worth it. Research from a number of sources, including our colleagues at the San Francisco and New York Feds, shows that overall, the investment in college still delivers a good return.8 We have a visiting scholar at the Philadelphia Fed whose research delves even deeper, showing life-cycle returns on varying degree majors — business and STEM pay off the most, in terms of financial return, followed by social sciences, then the arts and humanities.9 His name is Doug Webber, he’s a professor at Temple, and he actually has a list of expected lifetime earnings broken down by major if you want to see what’s in store.10\n\nThe one caveat from all the research is that to reap the rewards of college, you have to finish. The returns to attending, but not graduating, are not as significant, and those who don’t finish struggle much more with their debt burden.\n\nI should say here that I have been speaking about post-secondary education in its broadest sense, and the issues associated with loans — particularly that taking on debt and not finishing a course of study can have adverse financial effects — applies to all its forms. I believe firmly that not everyone wants or needs a traditional bachelor’s degree, and the Philadelphia Fed has done extensive work on alternative paths, from apprenticeships to skills training. There are a host of jobs that my staff has deemed “opportunity occupations,” which pay at or above the median income but don’t require a bachelor’s. Practical training and skills development in both conventional and nonconventional sectors fill much needed gaps for employers and offer careers for people who prefer that route. But the constant across all these options is that education and training are necessary. Apprenticeships and other “learn and earn” programs are excellent models that ease financial burdens. But for those who do want a four-year degree, and for anyone who takes out a loan for any type of education, I want their opportunities and access to be the same as their wealthier peers.\n\nI am concerned that the looming shadow of student debt, coupled with increasing uncertainty about loan forgiveness programs and income-driven repayment, may dissuade some potential students — particularly those from low- and middle-income families — from going to college or pursuing jobs in public service. And I’m additionally concerned that schools’ budgetary constraints may contribute to fewer of those students succeeding if they do attend.\n\nThe financial considerations for families are fundamental, but there are other, less tangible factors that either erect barriers to entering college or affect students’ success once they’ve enrolled. There are more elements to the school experience than just tuition and books, and campuses around the country have done great work to address that fact. Whether it’s navigating office hours or finding resources like free tutoring, programs that focus on underserved students have been important factors in their success. There’s a good body of research to back that up, both qualitative and quantitative.11 In fact, one of the Philadelphia Fed’s research teams is currently working with Rutgers University–Camden to assess the outcomes in one of its financial aid programs — in this case, one that offers financial relief to students well into the middle-class cohort. Part of their goal is to clarify those additional support needs.\n\nWhen I was at the University of Delaware, we had a program for students who were the first in their families to attend college. We had them arrive in June so they could spend a few months familiarizing themselves with experiences their families just couldn’t give them firsthand advice on. Some of it was academic, but a lot of it was soft skills, and it worked. Those students had first-year GPAs equivalent to their classmates whose families had a history of college attendance.\n\nIncreased cost pressures on institutions may force them to cut or curtail those programs, which would be a great loss, and disproportionately affect lower- and middle-income students.\n\nWhile on the one hand this is a simple matter of fairness and the crux of the argument that a level playing field will ensure success of the best, not the best funded, it is also a matter of importance to the economy. We’re talking about our future workforce, and to misallocate those resources, or funnel exceptional minds away from areas where they could have the most impact, is shooting ourselves in the foot.\n\nFinancial uncertainty and cuts to programs that support underrepresented students could exacerbate the achievement gap and increase income inequality. This isn’t just a social issue; research shows that inequality exacts a financial cost to the country as a whole.12 We are also missing out on vast opportunities on a national scale if we’re not tapping all our resources. A recent study investigates what the authors call our “lost Einsteins.” The researchers looked into the backgrounds of patent holders in the United States and found some common themes: People who scored well on math tests in elementary school made up the majority, which wasn’t a surprise. But they also came overwhelmingly from privileged backgrounds — low-income students who scored the highest on the tests weren’t any more likely to hold a patent than wealthy kids with below-average math scores. There were similar results for women, minorities, and people who lived in the southeast portion of the country.13 Since women alone make up more than half the population, the simple math tells us we’re missing out on a lot of potential and productivity in a majority of the population.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bottom line is that education is a good investment for the country as a whole. An educated workforce is a driver of growth and is crucial for sustained prosperity, and that’s important for all of us.\n\nIt’s vital that we ensure people can access the education they want and need and that we find ways to ease the financial burden for everyone. It’s a fundamental element of the U.S. economy, and we’ll be better off for it.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]The Pew Charitable Trusts, The Complex Story of American Debt: Liabilities in Family Balance Sheets (2015), pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/07/reach-of-debt-report_artfinal.pdf.\n\n[2]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB Warns Student Loan Servicing Problems Can Jeopardize Long-Term Financial Security for Older Borrowers (2017), https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-warns-student-loan-servicing-problems-can-jeopardize-long-term-financial-security-older-borrowers/.\n\n[3]Brent W.

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nI’m headed into my third year as a Fed president, and of all the lessons that stand out in the job, two are the most acute — Always include an outlook if the FOMC has just raised rates and always issue the standard Fed disclaimer: The views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith the disclaimer taken care of, today I will first address the outlook — this move was, after all, only the sixth one the FOMC has made since 2008. But then I want to discuss one of the myriad factors affecting the U.S. economy and its trajectory. The headline issues — from jobs reports to market movements to policy decisions — are obviously important factors in discussions of the U.S. economy. But there are other factors — deeper, underpinning secular trends — that play important roles and should also be examined. Today, therefore, I’d like to discuss the trends in U.S. dynamism.\n\nFirst, though, the promised outlook.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe labor market continues to strengthen, with strong jobs gains in recent months and continued low unemployment. I expect the unemployment rate to stay low and move down even further, possibly dipping as low as the 3.5 percent range in 2019, before ticking back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nWhile inflation continues to run below the Fed’s preferred 2 percent target this year, I see it as on track to meet or exceed that benchmark by the end of next year.\n\nTaking into account the effects of fiscal stimulus and recent strong economic activity, I continue to see above-trend growth of about 2.6 percent for 2018. That should edge down a bit to 2.4 percent for 2019, then move further south to 2 percent. Overall, that’s a very slight upward revision for my 2018 forecast but a stronger outlook over the medium term.\n\nOn the heels of a strengthening outlook, therefore, I see two additional rate hikes this year as appropriate. That projection continues to be written in pencil, as it is, like all things Fed related, data driven, but overall, things are looking pretty good.\n\nBusiness Dynamism\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the U.S. economy is that it has historically been characterized by an elevated level of dynamism. And while the U.S. economy is classically “dynamic” in its colloquial sense, characterized by the innovation and the imagination that drives it, I am speaking today more specifically about the economic measure of dynamism that is defined by turnover: New businesses enter the market and others leave, workers move from job to job, people come in and out of the workforce, and so on.\n\nThis perpetual churn makes resources more fluid, and they move around with relative ease. As labor and capital are freed to flow from the least to the most productive firms, productivity, wages, and overall economic growth increase.\n\nThat’s the general dynamism recipe that we all know and that has characterized the U.S. economy for most of the historical record.\n\nI suppose this wouldn’t be a policymaker’s speech if there weren’t a “however” coming, and here it is: However, the data indicate that, over the past 30 years or so, dynamism has been on the decline. Specifically, business start-up activity is lower than it used to be, and labor reallocation is also slowing, as is worker mobility. Over the past 20 years or so, we’ve seen a concurrent drop in productivity growth, which naturally poses the question of a causal relationship.\n\nI’ll spare the suspense of that question’s answer and say from the start that we don’t have definitive answers. I believe the old joke is that if you laid all the economists in the world end to end, they would never reach a consensus ...\n\nBut economic trends raise interesting possibilities and points for discussion, as do the factors affecting both their trajectories and our ability to manage them.\n\nSo I’d like to talk now about the trends in dynamism, the culprits in its retreat, and what can be done to reverse it.\n\nDynamism in Decline\n\nThe decline in dynamism and entrepreneurship since the early 1980s is evinced by a variety of measures. On the firm side, the new start-up rate has deteriorated by close to 40 percent.1 At the same time, the exit rate has been more or less flat — not just slowing the net start-up rate, but actually pushing it into negative territory.\n\nThe IPO rate is also falling, a measure that has been linked to encouraging entrepreneurship and start-up activity. It is additionally the case that, over the past decade, M&A activity has been strong. The end result is that industries are becoming more and more concentrated, and the average listed company is bigger, older, and more profitable.2\n\nOn the worker side, people are now more likely to be employed at large, mature firms than was previously the norm. The share of employment at smaller and medium-sized younger firms has fallen from about 20 percent to 10 percent in the past few decades, while the proportion of workers at larger, older firms has risen from about 40 percent to 50 percent.3\n\nWe’re also seeing the rate of job reallocation falling — that is, the number of jobs added to and subtracted from the economy. This is generally a substantial feature of the U.S. labor market — currently, roughly 14 million jobs are reallocated over a typical quarter — but the rate of reallocation has fallen by about 22 percent since the early ’90s.4\n\nAnother factor of today’s labor force is that workers are much less mobile than they used to be. This is something that’s frequently arisen in our examination of U.S. employment as we search out the “new normal” of the labor market in a post-recovery world. People aren’t moving for work the way they used to, and when they do, they don’t go as far. The rate of people moving out of state has dropped to less than half its average level in the quarter century that followed the Second World War.5\n\nThe Impact of Dynamism\n\nSo, the data clearly point to a decline in turnover and dynamism, but there’s a logical argument that older, bigger, more profitable firms hiring people who stay around longer is a perfectly natural state — a sort of settling into middle age for a mature economy. Is that the case? Why do we ascribe such importance to dynamism? Why do we view it as a sign of a healthy economy?\n\nHistory is awash with quotes about history being awash with lessons — and clichés, very often, have worked their way into the lexicon for a reason. So, the simple history of the role dynamism has played in the U.S. economy might be enough. But we are the Fed, and we like research, so I’d prefer to offer an analysis of dynamism’s influence, rather than rest on the laurels of “it’s always been that way.”\n\nThe first measure of importance to this inquiry is innovation intensity. Among those firms that invent, revolutionize, or — in our overused parlance — “disrupt” industries, it is the younger, smaller firms that spend more on R&D as a proportion of sales. Additionally, research shows that the quality of innovation — as measured by patent citations — is inversely proportionate to firm size, indicating that smaller firms have higher quality innovation.6 Older, more staid organizations achieve productivity growth from entry and exits to markets, or expansion and contraction of offices or factories. Manufacturing, for instance, derives a significant portion of its industry-level growth this way.\n\nAs we know from our days in undergraduate economics, high productivity firms grow faster than low productivity ones and contribute to a country’s overall productivity growth.\n\nNew firms also provide job opportunities. That is not to say that older firms — through continued growth, acquisition, and consolidation across industries — wouldn’t continue to produce jobs. But fast-growing businesses, which tend to be young, have historically accounted for a substantial fraction of job creation, averaging about 70 percent of gross annual job creation in the decades spanning 1992–2011.7\n\nMore fluid labor markets ease the path up the job ladder, allow workers to find better matches for their skills, and can encourage attachment to the labor force. As the labor market continues to tighten, and we need every person possible participating in the workforce, that becomes increasingly important. If a marginal worker’s job opportunities aren’t much more beneficial than not working, we’ll still have people on the sidelines. The longer they stay there, the less likely they are to be employed. With a more dynamic labor market, opportunities arise more frequently and are often better, decreasing the likelihood of someone staying out of work for an extended period of time.\n\nBy contrast, a sluggish employment landscape offers infrequent opportunities, which makes people ever more unemployable as they wait for something to come their way and disproportionately affects lower skilled, less educated, and younger workers. As the market stagnates, employers can become more exclusive — and more exclusionary — in whom they will hire, exacerbating the cycle for those who can’t meet the bar. They’ll stay out of work longer, and their prospects will be dimmer when opportunities do arise.\n\nThe Culprits\n\nSo the research tells us that business dynamism in the United States is falling. Can it tell us why it has experienced a downturn?\n\nThere are, of course, many competing hypotheses, and it wouldn’t be the dismal science if there were one definitive victor in the blame game. But the many potential contributing culprits are all worth exploring.\n\nThe fact that dynamism has slowed suggests that there has been some fundamental change in the economy.\n\nIt could be that the business climate is changing in ways that impede the reallocation of labor and capital. If costs in one area increase, that affects other margins, as businesses look to offset costs. That, in turn, can hinder the flow of resources from the least productive to the most productive firms. So, for example, if restrictions make it more difficult for existing firms to grow, new firms are less likely to enter the market because lifetime growth prospects are weaker. And if restrictions hinder job destruction by existing firms, job creation rates will fall as competition wanes.8\n\nWe also hear a lot about regulatory burden — and uncertainty about future regulation — when we talk about barriers to new business start-ups. And it is true that regulation has generally increased in the U.S. But that pace has not been constant or consistent across industries. We can, therefore, compare industry dynamism with industry regulation and get a sense of whether there’s any correlation. The evidence so far indicates that, in fact, the case for correlation is fairly weak, and where it does exist, it goes in the wrong direction.9 The same holds true for start-up rates.\n\nIt is also the case that, if the fixed cost of starting a new business had risen, we would expect to see that new firms are larger, on average, than in the past, but the data don’t bear that out either.10 We can infer, then, that there hasn’t been any outsized growth in the amount of seed money necessary to get a new firm off the ground.\n\nIt may be — to steal a phrase from another economist — that the change in the U.S. business climate is more akin to a “death by a thousand cuts” than a single blow of the regulatory axe, with small changes and encumbrances combining to create a larger barrier.11\n\nZoning restrictions, for instance, and other inhibitors of local growth could be impeding the flow of workers and capital to high productivity uses. The cost of relocating to a place like San Francisco or New York and attempting to start a new business is all but prohibitive, surely affecting the rate of new start-ups. By one estimate, lowering those kinds of constraints — for instance, on housing supply — in such high productivity cities would significantly expand their workforces and increase overall GDP by almost 10 percent.12\n\nThere has also been a marked increase in occupational licensing. The percentage of workers required to hold a government-issued license to do their jobs rose from less than 5 in the 1950s to almost 30 in 2008.13 That’s a six-fold increase and has manifested a creep into areas far outside what most of us would consider standard, like braiding hair or teeth whitening.\n\nBoth of those examples, by the way, come from Planet Money, which has a couple of very entertaining podcasts on occupational licensing that are worth a listen. I use them in part because they’re good examples and in part because it allows me to mention that at the beginning of the year, Philadelphia beat Boston in not one but two extremely important contests. We didn’t just take the Super Bowl; the Philadelphia Fed beat out the Boston Fed for first place in the “Beigie” awards, Planet Money's ode to the Beige Book. I don’t think Bill Belichick is losing much sleep over that one, but we were pretty pleased.\n\nIn any event, the bogeyman of big regulation does not appear to be the villain in this story, though the smaller, seemingly more benign, regulations may be combining to create something more malignant.\n\nThat said, the fact that the decline in business dynamism is not confined to the United States, but is occurring across OECD countries, suggests that broader, systemic forces are likely playing a role in the phenomenon.14 These are the same factors that are currently affecting other aspects of the economy: technological advancement, demographics, and measurement.\n\nTechnology has had a marked effect on the economy, and its various influences and effects are intertwined. In the labor market, it emerges in the automation of jobs and the increasing need for worker retraining to keep pace with change. In growth and productivity, it’s affecting the efficacy of measurement. In the case of business dynamism, technological advancements help larger firms to manage production and distribution across businesses, making them more efficient. More and better data and analysis allow them to adapt to changes in customer demand. This is a positive effect, but it would not show up in measures of dynamism.\n\nDemographic forces have been plaguing us as well. Our aging population is exerting downward pressure on the labor force participation rate, and research by my staff indicates that will continue.15 This also has an effect on dynamism, as older workers are less mobile and more likely to remain in jobs for longer periods of time. Population growth is also slowing, which is associated with a decline in start-up rates.16 Growth in the labor force is decelerating, too, and with fewer people entering the workforce, the churn of reallocation and worker mobility further suffers.\n\nFinally, we have the measurement conundrum. Creative destruction at the firm level isn’t captured by dynamism statistics. Take, for example, IBM’s reinvention in the early 1990s, after the collapse of the mainframe market. While it fundamentally remade itself into a different company, that shift wasn’t captured in the dynamism data on entry and exit. Dynamism doesn’t measure global activity very well either. In this case, Apple is the example. Apple constantly adds and drops suppliers as it continues its evolution in product development; in 2013, for instance, it had about 750 suppliers, but almost 90 percent of them were in Asia. That activity doesn’t show up in the U.S. dynamism statistics.\n\nWhat Can We Do About It?\n\nWhile we certainly have a measurement problem, it is still clear that dynamism is slowing and has been doing so steadily, not just in the U.S., but across mature economies. It is also the case that a number of factors are conspiring to keep it that way. So what, if anything, can be done?\n\nI should note here that dynamism, much like food or wine, should be taken in moderation, and an excess could lead to something of an economic hangover. The downside of dynamism, and the risk of overindulging in it, would be a glut of churn and all its attendant costs — frequent bankruptcies and business failures, high rates of firings and layoffs, too much job-hopping by workers. But in an environment with the right amount, it has its intended effect: Resources are channeled to more productive uses, workers are more engaged with the labor market, and innovation is nurtured.\n\nThe first avenue of recourse is that trustiest of panaceas: education. Our future entrepreneurs and inventors are in school today, and investing in that human capital is essential. There’s a recent paper by Raj Chetty and others that considers what we’re missing out on in terms of what they call “lost Einsteins” — the kids who could and should be patent holders later in life but aren’t getting access to adequate education. As demographic trends continue to exert pressure on our labor force, we’re going to need every contribution to the economy we can get. It’s an exercise in folly to think we can succeed without significant attention to, and investment in, education at all levels.\n\nWe also need to think about the future of that labor market and the role it plays in growth. Growth, as we all know, is fundamentally growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity. Without an increase in one of those variables, it will stagnate, and productivity growth, as I mentioned, has been low as well. It is neither my purview nor my desire to comment on legislation, but the economic fact is that we need more people in the workforce and that means in the country. We simply do not have the population to keep growth at even its current rate over the long term. I would also note that immigrants either founded or cofounded just over half of all U.S. start-ups valued at $1 billion or more, and immigrant founders have created an average of 760 jobs per company.17\n\nSecond, innovation and entrepreneurship need encouragement. That’s everything from funding research to sensible regulation that considers the benefits of innovation and does not offer unearned advantage to incumbents at the expense of new entrants.\n\nFinally, with a reissuance of my previous caveat that I am not in the business of weighing in on anyone else’s area of policymaking, ease of trade is essential. Small and medium-sized firms account for about 97 percent of American businesses that export goods and services and make up around 34 percent of the total value of U.S. exports.18 Access to foreign markets and competition fuels innovation and productivity, and trade relationships offer opportunities to adapt and adjust new technologies developed outside our borders.\n\nConclusion\n\nDynamism is in decline. While the difficulties of measurement may play some part in our overall reading, they don’t account for its entirety and they don’t mitigate the broader secular trends. Dynamism is also essential to U.S. growth and competitive edge, so it’s unwise to leave it unprotected from economic fates and furies. There are things we can do, measures we can take, and decisions we can make that will affect its trajectory. And in the interest of the American economy, we should.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Ryan A.

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nI’m going to start today with the expected: an overview of the economy and where I see monetary policy headed. I’ll then segue into perhaps the less expected — but nonetheless apropos — subject of the cost of college and how that relates to the American economy.\n\nBefore I start, I’ll issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nWith that out of the way, a brief overview of the economy, which is doing pretty well.\n\nOn the growth front, consumer spending remains the driving force as it has been for the past few years. I see that contributing to above-trend real GDP growth in 2018, which I forecast will be about 2.5 percent. After this year, I expect growth to move back down, hovering around the 2 percent mark for 2019, and then edging further south.\n\nOn the employment side of our mandate, things are also strong. The labor market continues to tighten, and I see the unemployment rate continuing to drop, reaching as low as 3.6 percent by mid-2019. After that, I expect it to rise back up a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nIn other signs of labor market conditions, I expect job creation to remain strong in 2018. I should note that, as the market continues to tighten, we will eventually see job creation slow — ultimately, if trends remain as they are, we won’t need much more than about 100,000 a month to keep up with population growth. It’s something to remember on the first Friday of the month when commentators call, say, 160,000 jobs disappointing. It’s all a matter of context.\n\nThe inflation side of the Fed’s mandate is not quite where we want it to be, with inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target. I do, however, forecast that it will reach, or exceed, that benchmark by the end of 2019.\n\nBased on the relatively strong economy, but the continued stubbornness of inflation, I’ve penciled in two hikes for 2018. I use pencil because the data can change, and sometimes they don’t accurately point to future events. Like when they predict a Patriots Super Bowl win. The Fed’s mantra is data dependent, and for now, the data continue to tell me two is the likely appropriate path.\n\nThe other discussion about Fed policy is whether we will rethink our longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, which I am open to. I’m not advocating for a change, and I don’t have any particular favorite in the alternatives. If we do have that conversation, I would expect a full and healthy debate of all the alternatives and their pros and cons.\n\nThe Cost of College\n\nNow to shift gears a bit but only a bit. The headlines about the cost of college show it’s obviously pertinent to the national economy. But it goes deeper than the headlines, and I find that the underlying, secular trends are more impactful. So I’d like to talk about the several ways college, and the cost of college, affect the overall economy.\n\nI want to make it clear from the start that when we talk about the price of college, we are certainly talking about the cost to individuals, but we’re also talking about the financial constraints on the colleges themselves. The instinct is often to blame the universities, but they, too, are facing financial strain that is unlikely to ease.\n\nI should interject here that I can come at this issue from a number of angles, with experience as a professor, as a business school dean, as a university president, and as the parent of three millennial children, including one who’s just finished grad school. Each of those gives me a different perspective. But I’m going to speak today from the viewpoint of a monetary policymaker, with all the detached practicality that entails.\n\nFirst and foremost, it’s important to be clear about the value of education itself. From pre–K to postgrad, the importance of education is almost impossible to overstate.\n\nIt is one of the constants of human history that, throughout cultures and epochs, the foundation of every society has rested on the education of its people. From a policy perspective, education is the heart that pumps the blood into every other organ in the economy. It trains our workforce, it emboldens our innovation, it sharpens our competitive edge.\n\nI am a great proponent of education for education’s sake, but I’m also a pragmatist in that much of the goal of postsecondary education is to prepare students for work. And we have a very different labor landscape today than when I was in college. We live in a world that is rapidly changing on both a demographic and technological level, and the old models aren’t necessarily keeping up with the demand for change.\n\nSecular Trends\n\nFirst, the demographics.\n\nLabor force participation in the United States is significantly lower than a decade ago. This is largely due to demographic factors and, according to research by my staff, is likely to continue to decline. I know that millennials are tired of hearing that everything is their fault, tired of headlines saying they’re buying too much avocado toast and not enough housing. So the younger of you in the audience will be delighted to hear that this one you can blame on the boomers. The boomers represent the largest generation in our history to head into retirement, and they’re living longer as well. And while I’m delighted at the prospect of the extended cut of my own golden years, this will put a strain on the economy.\n\nFor one, it means more people living on fixed retirement incomes, more people depending on Medicare and Social Security, and more people whose medical and general care expenses will be higher than they are now. Much of that burden will fall on the generations behind them.\n\nIt also means experiencing the downside of a simple economic equation: Growth is, fundamentally, growth in the labor force plus growth in productivity. Without an increase in one of those variables, GDP is likely to suffer, and in recent years, productivity growth has proven to be stubbornly low as well. Simply put, we need more people.\n\nAnd while the millennial generation is actually larger than the boomers, millennials are both not yet in their prime earning years and not large enough in number to increase labor-force growth sufficiently. Additionally, the birth drop-off in the mid-’90s means that colleges are likely facing fewer occupants of classroom seats in the foreseeable future. This is an issue because the cost of college is, of course, affected by the numbers of people actually in college.\n\nI want to reiterate the caveat about the views I express as being my own, and I want to make it clear that I’m a monetary policymaker — I don’t add my two cents to fiscal, foreign, domestic, or any other policy. But people coming off the sidelines, as well as into the country, add much needed numbers to our workforce. They’re also a component of financial success for colleges and universities. Students coming from abroad are an important revenue stream for colleges and universities because they pay higher tuition fees and contribute substantially to business and STEM programs. If it becomes harder for them to come, or if increased competition from abroad gives them incentive to stay home or go elsewhere, institutions’ bottom lines suffer and our economy overall misses out on U.S.-educated students in critical fields. This won’t be remedied by simply filling the void with American students; there are entire programs that just don’t have enough domestic candidates to survive.\n\nAnother aspect of the landscape that has changed significantly since my own college days is the way technology has affected all aspects of work. It’s no longer uncommon for people to have several careers in their working lifetime, and constant retraining is essential in virtually every occupation. And I’m not just talking about, say, doctors keeping up with the latest surgical invention; I mean that being an auto mechanic today is as much about the computer as it is about the chassis.\n\nSo, on this vast, macro level, we have the two irresistible forces of demographics and technology affecting the very movable object of the American workforce.\n\nFinancial Pressures and Barriers to Entry\n\nBut we also have myriad financial factors affecting the individuals who make up the nation’s student body and our current and future workers, not to mention the pressures on higher education institutions themselves. Those burdens may affect the decisions people make about whether and how to pursue postsecondary education.\n\nBoth the sticker price of tuition and the discounted rate have risen faster than incomes over the past 20 years.\n\nAt the same time, state funding for higher education institutions has been steadily diminishing. Demographics are bound to impact this issue even further as an increasing share of budgets on the local, state, and federal levels goes toward retirement benefits, pensions, and health care.\n\nThese factors contribute to the growing share of student loans, which now makes up the second-largest slice of the consumer debt pie, surpassed only by mortgages. While the issue of tuition prices and decreased funding have fueled the market for student loans, I worry that mounting numbers, combined with uncertainty about the future of repayment and forgiveness programs, may deter some lower- and moderate-income students from entering higher education.\n\nAnd while the financial determinants have received a lot of attention, there are other, less tangible factors that either erect barriers to entering college or affect students’ success once they’ve enrolled. There are more elements to the school experience than just tuition and books, and campuses around the country have done great work to address that fact. Whether it’s navigating office hours or finding resources like free tutoring, programs that focus on underserved students have been important factors in their success. There’s a good body of research to back that up, both qualitative and quantitative.1 In fact, one of the Philadelphia Fed’s research teams is currently working with Rutgers University–Camden to assess the outcomes in one of its financial aid programs — in this case, one that offers financial relief to students well into the middle-class cohort. Part of their goal is to clarify those additional support needs.\n\nWhen I was at the University of Delaware, we had a program for students who were the first in their families to attend college. We had them arrive in June so they could spend a few months familiarizing themselves with experiences their families just couldn’t give them firsthand advice on. Some of it was academic, but a lot of it was soft skills, and it worked. Those students had first-year GPAs equivalent to their classmates whose families had a history of college attendance.\n\nIncreased cost pressures on institutions may force them to cut or curtail those programs, which would be a great loss, and disproportionately affect lower- and middle-income students.\n\nThe Resonating Impact\n\nThe overall issue of student debt is important because it doesn’t just affect individuals; it resonates across generational lines in families and spreads into the wider economy.\n\nResearch shows that in the decade leading up to 2015, the number of adults over 60 who took on student debt quadrupled, with roughly three-quarters of that being assumed on behalf of children or grandchildren.2 Given the same demographic shifts I mentioned earlier, that means debt is being held by a substantial number of people living on fixed incomes, while the extended duration of their lives leaves them more likely to encounter increased care costs, making default a real threat.\n\nOn the national level, research by the Philadelphia Fed’s Consumer Finance Institute, along with others, shows that student debt is affecting both small business formation and homeownership rates.3,4\n\nThose obviously pose a risk far outside the confines of individual debt.\n\nFinancial uncertainty and cuts to programs that support underrepresented students could also exacerbate the achievement gap and increase income inequality. This isn’t just a social issue; research shows that inequality exacts a financial cost to the country as a whole.5 We are also missing out on vast opportunities on a national scale if we’re not tapping all our resources. It makes logical sense that if sharp minds are denied access to a good education, they won’t reach their full potential. It’s an old argument, but new research backs this theory up, investigating what the authors call our “lost Einsteins.” The researchers looked into the backgrounds of patent holders in the United States and found some common themes: People who scored well on elementary math tests made up the majority, which wasn’t a surprise. But they also came overwhelmingly from privileged backgrounds — low-income students who scored the highest on the tests weren’t any more likely to hold a patent than wealthy kids with below-average math scores. There were similar results for women, minorities, and people who lived in the southeast portion of the country.6 Women alone make up more than half the population; the simple numbers tell us we’re missing out on a lot of potential and productivity in a majority of the population.\n\nRethinking Old Models\n\nAs I said earlier, I come at this issue from a lot of different angles, and the one I’ve chosen — the view of a policy wonk — can get away with bringing the doom and gloom and then leaving the stage. But I’ve seen a lot of inventive thinking on campuses, both as a Fed president and in my former academic life, so I’m going to step into the territory of opining about solutions. Again, remember that disclaimer and send any angry emails directly to me … Changing some of the conventional wisdom in higher education could help. It can’t solve the entire problem but thinking about the way we deliver postsecondary education, and the business models of the institutions, can make a difference.\n\nThe first question for colleges is, are we making the best use of all our resources? There are ways to use assets outside the standard models. Language departments can partner with other schools with bigger budgets to provide career-based instruction, like nursing schools certifying health-care-oriented Spanish or business schools offering business Mandarin. This isn’t a declared minor, it doesn’t require tenured faculty, and much of it can be done with supplementary software and less time in the classroom. That might seem like common sense, especially to the students here, but academia can be almost intractably rooted in orthodoxy, and moving beyond comfort zones — or thinking about education as a revenue stream — can make people uncomfortable. There is often a resistance to change, even when it’s in the best economic interests of the institution. The call from many — and I count myself as one — is for more creative approaches to maximizing an institution’s assets.\n\nSome of the most innovative thinking I’ve seen lately has come out of community colleges. As I said earlier, education for its own sake is important, and so is the range of learning that comes with a four-year degree. But there are also gaps to be filled in a constantly evolving workforce and new careers and areas of research that schools can branch out into.\n\nI was recently touring Atlantic City and the wider Atlantic County, which are part of my District. Like a lot of places, when one industry drives the economy, it can be hard to diversify. Atlantic County is trying to optimize its assets beyond gambling to bring more growth to the area. I always knew they had an airport out there, but I hadn’t realized the size and scope of it, even though I’m a New Jersey native. It’s a hub of FAA research labs, they train U.S. Marshals, and the Coast Guard and Air National Guard have facilities there. It’s got a 10,000-foot-runway that was built so the space shuttle could land in case of emergency. As far as resources go, it’s a pretty great asset. But it wasn’t being used as well as it could have been. So the county talked to the airline industry, found out there’s a massive shortage of mechanics and other aviation specialists, and are working in partnership with Atlantic Cape Community College to create an institute on-site.\n\nOr take Philadelphia, where YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School, which serves students who’ve previously dropped out of high school, has partnered with the local community college on training and apprenticeships.\n\nPrograms like these can help students avoid debt, funnel people into well-paying, understaffed occupations, and develop new revenue streams without disrupting four-year programs.\n\nThe Value of Skills-Based Learning\n\nThey do something else important, which is that they stress the value of skills-based training and unconventional paths to education. Not everyone needs a four-year degree and not everyone needs to go college right away. A singular university experience isn’t right for everyone, and if we can shift the thinking on the different ways people engage in higher education, we can shift the thinking about the ways we provide it.\n\nMy staff has done research on what they call opportunity occupations, jobs that pay at or above the median wage without a traditional four-year degree. They don’t just know what fields they’re in; they know where they are geographically, which could make it easier to create a pipeline. These are good, solid careers that can support a middle-class life.\n\nApprenticeships can also be incredibly valuable, as can any “learn and earn” program. They are a path to a career, and people can save for school later on, go back for more training, or master a profession.\n\nI’m not advocating that traditional four-year institutions change their models to practical training. I am saying that the pragmatic approaches these programs take to meeting the needs of business and industry, while simultaneously being creative in how they educate students, can help us rethink some of the old ways of doing business.\n\nThis is the most inventive, diverse economy on the planet, and our approach to education should be just as innovative. In the face of multiple forces applying financial pressure, it just makes sense to rethink some of the ways institutions operate.\n\nConclusion\n\nEducation, at all levels, is fundamental to the success of the American economy and takes on even greater importance in the face of a declining labor force participation rate. We need every possible person playing an active part, and access to the right education is crucial to their — and our — success. If we can be creative about how we deliver all aspects of postsecondary education, we can increase institutions’ finances and better serve all students by preparing them for work, adapting to their needs, and helping them reduce or avoid debt.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]James J.

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nIn considering my remarks today, I found the narrative going in something of a spiral, because the topic of higher education is inextricably linked to so many others. Going down one route of inquiry leads inevitably to a dozen others, which branch off into a dozen more. Compounding that issue is that, while I view the subject from the perspective of a policymaker concerned with education’s immense influence on the country’s long-term economic strength, I also have the experience of an academic, a business school dean, and a university president. I’ve seen how the administrative sausage is made; so whatever your role in the process, I can commiserate.\n\nOne of the wonderful things about academia is that you can be provocative in your opinions on policy orthodoxy — and I’ve certainly been accused of that once or twice. As a Federal Reserve president, however, I tend to be more circumspect in my public declarations and am bound — just to be on the safe side — to deliver the standard disclaimer that absolves my colleagues from association with anything I might say to offend: The views I share today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, I’d like to talk today about the essential role that higher education plays in the economy, address some of the issues facing the sector on both a macro and micro level, and, at the end, perhaps question some operational orthodoxies. Just as a throwback to my academic days.\n\nEducation’s Fundamental Economic Role\n\nThe issue of education’s importance is easy to address and almost impossible to overstate. It is one of the constants of human history that throughout cultures and epochs, the foundation of every society has rested on the education of its people. From a policy perspective, education is the heart that pumps the blood into every other organ in the economy. It trains our workforce, it emboldens our innovation, it sharpens our competitive edge.\n\nThe institutions that perform this vital function of the American economy, and you, the people who help execute that mission, have a monumental amount of responsibility on your shoulders. And I am fully aware that you are doing it in the face of change and challenges, most of which you have no control over. But no pressure.\n\nSo I’d like to talk a little about the conditions in which you’re operating, and some of the factors affecting your current and future work, that also impact the nation as a whole.\n\nA Changing Landscape\n\nWhile there is a lot of discussion about headline issues right now, I find that the underlying, secular trends that get less attention are significantly more impactful. We live in a world that is rapidly changing on both a demographic and technological level, and the old models aren’t necessarily keeping up with the demand for change.\n\nI am a great proponent of education for education’s sake, but I’m also a pragmatist in that much of the goal of postsecondary education is to prepare students for work.

Both the sticker price of tuition and the discounted rate have risen faster than incomes over the past 20 years, putting pressure on households’ finances.\n\nSecond, as everyone in this room will be acutely aware, there is the issue of dwindling state funding. Demographics are bound to impact this issue even further as an increasing share of budgets on the local, state, and federal levels goes toward retirement benefits, pensions, and health care.\n\nThese factors both contribute to the growing share of student loans, which now makes up the second-largest slice of the consumer debt pie, surpassed only by mortgages.

There were similar results for women, minorities, and people who lived in the southeast portion of the country.6 Women alone make up more than half the population; the simple numbers tell us we’re missing out on a lot of potential and productivity in a majority of the population.\n\nThat, in turn, comes back to an issue for higher education: Some of the best minds out there aren’t being recruited; institutions have to invest in ways to reach new and different communities, both because potential is going unfulfilled and because demographic trends are going to force them to.\n\nRethinking Old Models\n\nHere’s where I make the appeal to question the conventional wisdom. As I said earlier, I come at this issue from a lot of different angles, and I know that, with this audience, I’m preaching to the choir. I’ve seen a lot of inventive thinking on campuses, but I’ve also seen some of those proposals made in vain, purely out of a resistance to change.\n\nAre we making the best use of all our resources? Language departments can partner with other schools with bigger budgets to provide career-based instruction, like nursing schools certifying health-care-oriented Spanish or business schools offering business Mandarin. This isn’t a declared minor, it doesn’t require tenured faculty, and much of it can be done with supplementary software and less time in the classroom. But I’ve heard of department heads retreating from ideas like this, even those fully funded by another school, because they don’t fall within a traditional model. And those are the kinds of programs that can attract outside organizations as well.\n\nSome of the most innovative thinking I’ve seen lately has come out of community colleges. As I said earlier, education for its own sake is important, and so is the range of learning that comes with a four-year degree. But there are also gaps to be filled in a constantly evolving workforce and new careers and areas of research that schools can branch out into.\n\nI was recently touring Atlantic City and the wider Atlantic County, which are part of my District. Like a lot of places, when one industry drives the economy, it can be hard to diversify. Atlantic County is trying to optimize its assets beyond gambling to bring more growth to the area. I always knew they had an airport out there, but I hadn’t realized the size and scope of it, even though I’m a New Jersey native. It’s a hub of FAA research labs, they train U.S. Marshals, and the Coast Guard and Air National Guard have facilities there. It’s got a 10,000-foot-runway that was built so the space shuttle could land in case of emergency. As far as resources go, it’s a pretty great asset. But it wasn’t being used as well as it could have been. So the county talked to the airline industry, found out there’s a massive shortage of mechanics and other aviation specialists, and are working in partnership with Atlantic Cape Community College to create an institute on-site.\n\nOr take Philadelphia, where YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School, which serves students who’ve previously dropped out of high school, has partnered with the local community college on training and apprenticeships.\n\nPrograms like these can help students avoid debt, funnel people into well-paying, understaffed occupations, and develop new revenue streams without disrupting four-year programs.\n\nThe Value of Skills-Based Learning\n\nThey do something else important, which is that they stress the value of skills-based training and unconventional paths to education. Not everyone needs a four-year degree and not everyone needs to go college right away. A singular university experience isn’t right for everyone, and if we can shift the thinking on the different ways people engage in higher education, we can shift the thinking about the ways we provide it.\n\nMy staff has done research on what they call opportunity occupations, jobs that pay at or above the median wage without a traditional four-year degree. They don’t just know what fields they’re in; they know where they are geographically, which could make it easier to create a pipeline. These are good, solid careers that can support a middle-class life.\n\nApprenticeships can also be incredibly valuable, as can any “learn and earn” program. They are a path to a career, and people can save for school later on, go back for more training, or master a profession.\n\nI’m not advocating that traditional four-year institutions change their models to practical training. I am saying that the pragmatic approaches these programs take to meeting the needs of business and industry, while simultaneously being creative in how they educate students, can help us rethink some of the old ways of doing business.\n\nThis is the most inventive, diverse economy on the planet, and our approach to education should be just as innovative. In the face of multiple forces applying financial pressure, it just makes sense to rethink some of the ways institutions operate.\n\nConclusion\n\nBob Zemsky has long argued that higher education has been almost unique in its resistance to taking the steps necessary to improve labor productivity, steps that virtually every other industry has and would take. I don’t know that I want to wade far into that particular quagmire, if only to avoid a flurry of e-mails from my former colleagues and contemporaries. I do know that higher education is operating in changing economic circumstances, with financial pressures coming from multiple directions. I know that these institutions are hubs of intellect and creative thinking, so the tools are all there. I know that sometimes we all need a little push to move outside our comfort zones and try new ways to achieve our goals. And I know that the men and women in the room today can play a critical role in making that happen.\n\nThank you. I’m happy to take any questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]James J. Heckman and Tim D.

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you. I have to say that I’m a native son of the Fed’s Third District, and I’m always pleased to travel around, especially to places like beautiful Bucks County. That said, the winter months make me wonder what it’s like to be president of the Dallas Fed …\n\nWe’ve just exited the season of looking back — of year-end recaps, of “the best and worst of 2017,” and enough top-ten lists to make your head spin. So, in the spirit of the new year, I’d like to take the opportunity to look forward instead.\n\nOf course, in giving my outlook, I’m aware that we’re standing in week two of 2018, and December — when the next round of “the year in review” commences — is very far away. Still, I have my forecast at least penciled in as well as some areas I’ll be watching for development.\n\nNow is the perfect time to note, with the standard Fed disclaimer, that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that caveat firmly in place, I’ll start with the outlook.\n\nThe Outlook\n\nThat outlook is, by most measures, pretty good. We’re headed into the ninth year of the expansion, and we’ve maintained a steady momentum.\n\nRegarding growth, I’ve revised my forecast up slightly for 2018. Factoring in fiscal policy, I see GDP growth averaging just under 2½ percent for the year, and then dropping a little lower, to 2.2 percent, for 2019.\n\nOn the employment side of our mandate, things are looking robust. Unemployment stands at 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years, and a variety of other indicators show a labor market with very little slack left.\n\nThe U6 measure of unemployment, which casts a wider net to include marginally attached workers and people who are working part time for economic reasons, has also moved back down to prerecession lows at 8.1 percent.\n\nQuits and job turnover rates are high, and the most common feedback I’m getting is that businesses are having a difficult time filling positions.\n\nIn fact, of the things to watch in 2018, it’s the shortage of workers, rather than jobs, that I’ll be keeping an eye on.\n\nOf course, that’s the 30,000-foot view. I’m well aware that the numbers we analyze and debate are more nuanced in such a multifaceted country than the macro view would indicate. Though my District is the smallest in the Federal Reserve System — covering about two-thirds of Pennsylvania from Johnstown and east, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware — it encompasses the spectrum of economic fortunes. There are some areas that are still struggling, and some areas that are booming.\n\nOn a local level, this is one of the areas that is doing well. Looking at the Montgomery-Bucks-Chester County Metro Division, overall labor market conditions have been solid for some time, and the unemployment rate is below the state average. Job growth was driven largely by sectors such as Professional and Business Services, Financial Services, and Education and Health.\n\nTurning to inflation, that’s the one area of marginal concern in an otherwise solid economy as it continues to run below target, not just at home, but abroad. I often note that this is something that only central bankers and policymakers seem to have an issue with. If you ask the average person on the street, or the average business owner, he’s likely to think low inflation is great. But for the policy wonks, we do want to see it rise. The Fed has a target of 2 percent average inflation, and it’s been a few years since we’ve hit that mark.\n\nI expect inflation in the U.S. to continue to run just under our mark this year, rise a bit above target in 2019, and then come back down to our 2 percent goal the following year. But projections are only that — projections — and I’m more guarded in my view about the path of inflation than I am about economic activity.\n\nFor that reason — and this is the part people always care about the most — I see two rate increases as the likely appropriate path for 2018. Of course, I’ll continue to monitor the data as they roll in, but that’s the view in the first month of the new year.\n\nAs I noted, the beginning of the new year is a chance to look forward. And the beginning of 2018 marks something of a new point in the journey of modern economic history. We talk frequently about the “new normal” when it comes to the economy and to monetary policy; it’s perhaps the most overused phrase in this context. But just because something has become cliché doesn’t mean it’s not accurate. The truth is, things are unlikely to return to what we considered their relative norms before the recession.\n\nThere are, therefore, a few issues on the horizon that I’m keeping my eye on. None of them are likely to cause disruption — to be frank, most of them would make for boring conversation — but they are facets of what the landscape will likely look like.\n\nUnwinding the Balance Sheet\n\nThe first is that, as you know, we are unwinding the Fed’s balance sheet. You also likely know how it got to its current size but as a quick reminder: In the aftermath of the financial crisis and subsequent recession, the Fed turned to extraordinary monetary policy, the most well-known — and definitely the most discussed — being quantitative easing, or QE. During the three rounds we engaged in, QE involved buying more and different assets than our usual practice of holding mostly short-term Treasuries. We purchased longer-term Treasuries and bought mortgage-backed securities as well. That swelled the balance sheet to approximately $4.5 trillion, significantly larger than the roughly $900 billion before the crisis. Additionally, because of the infusion of mortgage-backed securities, the balance sheet as a whole looks quite different now.\n\nOnce we ended the purchases, in late 2014, we simply reinvested the proceedings as they reached maturity to keep the balance sheet constant.\n\nLast October, we began to taper reinvestments in a step to further normalize monetary policy. We will continue to let assets fall off, until the balance sheet reaches whatever the new normal is.\n\nThe first thing to note is that we are not yet sure what that eventual size will be. We are in a different economy than the one before the crisis, so it won’t look the same as it did in, say, 2006. The economy has grown since then, and the Fed’s balance sheet has always grown with the nominal economy. The second thing to note is that we haven’t faced exactly this type of normalization before; no one has. The third thing to note is that this won’t be anywhere near as dramatic as the first two things might make it sound. This will be a slow, mechanical process, and we are essentially letting the balance sheet unwind in the background. We will, of course, keep an eye on it, and if any shock to the economic system occurs, we’ll revisit our plans. But fundamentally, this is perhaps the most boring function of current monetary policy. Still, it is new and will be an aspect of policy for this and the next few years or so.\n\nThe Yield Curve\n\nThe second issue I’m watching is the yield curve, and I’m sure I’m not alone in this room. My assessment is that the worries so far have been inflated. Again, for the uninitiated, the yield curve traces the difference in the rates of return on shorter- versus longer-term securities. The closer the rates get, the flatter the curve. A flattening yield curve can reflect the market’s assessment of economic conditions, so a flattening is often thought to be a precursor to a downward shift in overall economic conditions. However, that’s not a law of economic nature by any means, and consumer confidence is, in fact, high at the moment.\n\nThe situation we’re in now is not the same as, for instance, the inversion of the yield curve associated with the ’70s and ’80s, although it does bear some resemblance to the flattening in the mid-2000s. One concern may be that financial institutions lengthen terms of loans and investment in a search for yield. But I think the continued removal of accommodation will help somewhat, and, overall, I don’t think it’s in need of more stringent monitoring than other developments.\n\nLow R* and Policy Implications\n\nFinally, what I think is the most important issue right now is that the new economic world we’re entering may force policymakers to reevaluate our targets.\n\nThere has been a lot of research lately, including by my colleagues at the Board of Governors and other Reserve Banks, indicating that natural rates of interest may be lower than what’s been typical in the past.\n\nWhile we talk about the Fed “raising interest rates,” what we actually mean is that the Federal Reserve sets the federal funds rate — or, more specifically, the range of the fed funds rate. That’s the rate that banks lend to each other for short periods, generally overnight. That rate tends to influence overall interest rates, which is why the shorthand is generally acceptable for discussion. Then there is the natural rate of interest, or r* (r-star). This is the short-term rate of interest at which monetary policy neither inhibits nor encourages growth or inflation. R* is a function of economic variables and forces, such as, for instance, productivity, which is out of the Fed’s control.\n\nMarket interest rates have been trending downward for years, starting long before the recession and appearing to have continued through the crisis and the current expansion. If it is the case that we are in a low r* world right now — and are likely to stay there for some time — that puts us in something of a bind because it means we’re closer to what’s known as the zero lower bound. That is, the Fed can’t lower the feds fund rate much further than zero. So, if the natural rate of interest is lower, we have a smaller window in which to deploy rate moves, which is our primary monetary policy tool. That, in turn, means we have less policy ammunition in the event of an unexpected turn of events or, worse, a full-blown crisis. We can only play the hand we’re dealt, and fed funds can only operate within the scope that the natural funds rate allows.\n\nIf it is the case that we’re in a low r* environment, and one that is likely to last for a decent amount of time, it could be difficult to meet our inflation target. If that were to happen, it could impact inflation expectations, further complicating the issue. Inflation can fall victim to a self-fulfilling prophecy: One of economics’ idiosyncrasies is that market expectations of low inflation can actually contribute to making it happen.\n\nIn that case, we at the Fed could be forced to rethink our policies. I am not — for the record and to be very clear — suggesting that we should. I am saying that if the possibilities we are currently debating turn out to be the new reality, then that is one option that is on the table.\n\nIn such a scenario, I have no particular option I’d prefer, but I would expect that the economics profession in general, and the Fed in particular, would debate them fully and equally. Ultimately, it’s a question for the economics profession, and, if nothing else, I hope that the already substantial body of academic work gets even more robust.\n\nThat’s the list of things I’m watching in 2018. It’s a relatively short one, but it contains within it a lot of possible discussions. In having those, I’ll give a final thought on what I see as important for 2018, and that is how and when we have those discussions.\n\nOne of the lessons we’ve learned most acutely over the past decade is the importance of clear, concise communication.\n\nAs an example, the taper tantrum of 2013 showed us very clearly that what we think we’re communicating as policymakers, and what markets hear, are sometimes two different things. By contrast, our communications about unwinding the balance sheet came early, often, and almost via bullhorn. The markets heard us and more or less yawned; they knew what to expect.\n\nSo, to wrap up: There’s a lot on the horizon for monetary policy in 2018. It will be a time of transition and change, but one that I expect, overall, to go smoothly. We’ve learned the lessons of the past and are being thoughtful and watchful as the year unfolds. While it should be a year of developments, it should also be a boring one.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Thank you, it’s a pleasure to be here, particularly in such good company. People start paying a lot less attention to Fed presidents when we roll off our voting positions, so maybe some of the limelight from my esteemed fellow panelists will fall on me.\n\nI’ve been asked today to share my views on the U.S. economic outlook and the appropriate stance for monetary policy over the near term. That part about “my views” is an excellent segue to the standard Fed disclaimer that I’m sure you’ve already heard enough times to know by heart: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith takes the honor of probably the most quoted — and some might say the most accurate — line about economic forecasting, which is that it exists to make astrology look respectable.\n\nJokes aside, we’re in a time and place in the arc of economic history — both domestically and globally — that renders prediction slightly more difficult. I’m a firm believer in the Fed’s mantra of being data driven, and 2018 is, for me, a year to be in monitoring mode.\n\nSo, rather than go into a lengthy disquisition, and, in the spirit of the new year’s call to be more perfect people, I’m going to keep to my time today and just give a brief overview of where I think we’re heading and what I’ll be watching.\n\nI see growth of a little under 2½ percent for the year.\n\nI see a labor market with very little slack left. I expect the unemployment rate to stay low before ticking back up a few tenths of a percentage point sometime after this year.\n\nJob creation will slow and should dip to around 100,000 a month by the end of 2019, but that’s to be expected, and it’s more than enough to keep pace with population growth.\n\nInflation continues to run below target, not just in the U.S. but in countries across the globe. Domestically, I expect inflation will run a bit above target in 2019 and come down to target the following year, but I am more hesitant in this view than I am on economic activity. If soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem, which I’ll get to shortly.\n\nFor that reason, my own view is that two rate increases are likely to be appropriate for 2018.\n\nOf course, I’ll continue to monitor the data as they roll in, but that’s the view as we start out the new year.\n\nAside from inflation having stayed persistently under target for longer than we forecast, there is a lot to watch generally, and much of it, in some form or another, is new territory. The phrase the “new normal” has become so common that it’s almost cliché, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an accurate assessment of the current situation. I don’t see any of it as particularly disruptive, but it’s new nonetheless.\n\nWe are unwinding the largest balance sheet in Fed history, and, largely because of the infusion of MBS during QE, it also looks different than it did before the recession. This normalization has, and will continue to be, one of the most boring functions of monetary policy — and aside from those of us gathered here today, not a lot of people consider monetary policy a barn burner of a subject in the first place. It will unwind mechanically in the background and, because it has been so well communicated, should have minimal effects going forward. Still, it’s new territory.\n\nI’m also keeping an eye on the yield curve. I think worries so far have been a little inflated, and I don’t think the situation we’re in now is analogous to the inversion associated with the stagflation of the ’70s and ’80s. It does bear some resemblance to the flattening in the mid-2000s. Overall, I’m keeping the same watchful eye that I am on a lot of other developments, but I think the removal of accommodation will help somewhat, and I don’t think it warrants shouting “fire” in a crowded theater.\n\nThe most important issue on the table right now is that we need to consider the possibility of a new economic normal that forces us to reevaluate our targets. There has been a lot of research lately, including by my colleagues at the Board of Governors and other Reserve Banks, suggesting that we may just be in a low r* (r-star) environment right now.\n\nMarket interest rates have been trending downward for years, starting long before the recession and appearing to have continued through the crisis and the current expansion. That obviously pulls us closer to the zero lower bound and leaves us with less policy ammunition in an unexpected turn of events or, worse, a full-blown crisis. We can only play the hand we’re dealt, and fed funds can only operate within the scope that the natural funds rate allows.\n\nThe conundrum of central banking, and the Fed in particular, is that while monetary policy is an important tool, it’s a blunt one and is limited by the environment in which it’s conducted. When people talk about the Fed being the most important body in the economy, I have to laugh a little; it’s important, absolutely. But we are a single factor in a massive machine with multiple moving parts.\n\nSo, if it is the case that we’re in a low r* environment and one that is likely to last for a decent amount of time, will we have to start discussing other options? In such an environment, and with a symmetric loss function, it may be difficult to meet our inflation objective. Relatively frequent occurrences of zero lower bound constraints may imply that inflation will, on average, run below 2 percent rather than above it. In that scenario, inflation expectations could trend down, making it even more difficult to meet our target. It may, therefore, be time to reevaluate the way we conduct policy. I should be clear that I’m not pushing for any changes, nor do I have any particular change I would prefer.\n\nBut it is a question for the profession itself, and we do need people thinking about this. I’d add that if and when that discussion arises, we need to be seriously considering the various alternatives — whether it’s inflation targeting, price-level targeting, or asymmetric loss functions — and not fixating on one without serious academic debate about the others.\n\nThe last thing I’d add is that of the various lessons of the past decade, the importance of communication will apply here. One of the key lessons of the taper tantrum, which was confirmed by the announcement that we’d be normalizing the balance sheet, is that the way we signal our intention to the markets and public is essential. I wasn’t a Fed president in 2013, but I was on the board of directors at the Philadelphia Fed, and we were surprised by the market’s reaction. Consequently, we took pains to communicate early and often — we did everything short of putting it in skywriting — that we were planning to start unwinding. When we did, the markets shrugged.\n\nThis is important because, as a colleague of mine points out, something like an asymmetric loss function is easy to explain in an economic research paper; it’s harder to communicate to markets and the public. Whatever steps we may ultimately take in the future, communication has to be part of it.\n\nIn keeping with my promise, I’m going to end it there. I think the areas to watch, discuss, research, and evaluate are a relatively short list in and of themselves. The conversations, however, are myriad.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome. I am pleased to be here at the 12th Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum, my second since joining the Bank as president and CEO in 2015. I am excited to continue the biennial tradition that brings together some of the world’s most renowned economic thought leaders to discuss emerging research and its implications for economic policy.\n\nThis year, we’ve shifted locations. While normally this event is held at the Philadelphia Fed, we have brought it here to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to accommodate an expanded audience for this year’s forum.\n\nWhile you are here, I encourage you to visit the Mütter Museum. The College of Physicians has graciously offered free entrance today to its museum of medical history to all our attendees. If you have not been, it’s really a can’t-miss, quintessential Philadelphia experience. I must say, the Philadelphia Fed’s headquarters has many charms, but we really can’t compete with the Soap Lady or Albert Einstein’s brain.\n\nBefore I begin, let me give the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPromoting Inclusive Economic Growth\n\nThe shift for the Policy Forum is more than just geographic. This year, our theme is People, Place, Prosperity: Revitalizing Our Cities. This may seem off-topic for the Fed, from a focus on monetary policy and interest rates, to a focus on how the economy can develop in a way that reduces poverty and inequality. But it really isn’t. It’s merely a different way of looking at the same issues. And the high turnout for this event really speaks to the level of interest among you, one of our key audiences, to find ways to better understand and address these issues.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. When you think about what that means, our mission is really about creating an environment that promotes economic growth that is sustainable in the long term and that provides economic opportunity for everyone. That second goal — economic opportunity — means we want growth that is inclusive and accessible across all income groups and communities.\n\nThat’s because when we talk about the economy, we are really talking about people. People acquiring the right skills to find stable, family-sustaining jobs. People getting the best education for their children so that they can succeed. And it’s about the neighborhoods where people live and about the best way to ensure that their communities thrive.\n\nThat’s where the Fed’s community development function comes in, something that is near and dear to my heart.\n\nFor the past year, we at the Philadelphia Fed have been working on our Economic Growth & Mobility Project, or EGMP. This new initiative looks for practical applications for research in the area of inclusive economic growth. For instance, the Philadelphia Fed is involved in efforts in northeastern Pennsylvania to create an equitable transit system. We have provided regional-focused research and convened stakeholders to start the process of devising a transit system in the Scranton area that gets people to jobs and the other places they need to go.\n\nEGMP is about looking at the economy as a whole, looking beyond the data. Which isn’t to say numbers and data aren’t important. I am an engineer by training, so believe me when I say I love numbers. But numbers don’t tell the whole story. Overall, the U.S. economy is doing pretty well. Real GDP grew at a strong annual rate of 3 percent or better in the second and third quarters of this year. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is at the lowest since the year 2000. But when we look across the country, there are people and places that don’t share in that good fortune.\n\nRevitalizing Our Cities\n\nIt is fitting that we host you here in the City of Philadelphia. According to a recent study by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city has the highest percentage of residents living in deep poverty.1 The region’s poor are concentrated mainly in the city rather than in the counties that surround it. Philadelphia has only 26 percent of the region’s residents, but it is home to 51 percent of the poor.2 So, this is a good place to be having a discussion about revitalizing cities. Philadelphia may have the dubious distinction as the “poorest,” but it is by no means alone in the problems it faces or in its aspirations for the future.\n\nI travel frequently around the Third Federal Reserve District — which comprises eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware — and my monetary policy work takes me all over the world. These firsthand experiences really frame how I look at today’s agenda. Because everywhere I go, I meet people who are grappling with the same questions at the intersection of people, place, and prosperity. How do we build wealth in our communities without displacing residents? How do we plan for the coming technological innovations and make sure workers have the requisite skills to succeed? How do we promote not just economic growth but equitable growth for all? These are the questions we’ll be exploring here today.\n\nAs always with the Policy Forum, we are fortunate to have a truly all-star lineup to lead our discussion.\n\nResearch Focusing on People, Place, and Prosperity\n\nFor those of you who have been with us before, the structure of this year’s event will be a bit different. We’ll be opening with two academic panels. First, Gilles Duranton of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Edward Glaeser of Harvard University, and Henry Overman of the London School of Economics will kick us off with a presentation of research focusing on place — specifically, on urban growth and revitalization. Gerald Carlino, Philadelphia Fed emeritus economist, will moderate.\n\nSecond, we will focus on people by exploring the link between education and economic mobility. This panel will feature Will Dobbie of Princeton University and a visiting scholar at the Philadelphia Fed and Ingrid Gould Ellen of New York University. Phoebe Haddon, chancellor of Rutgers University–Camden and a member of the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors, will moderate.\n\nLast, but not least, John Fry, president of Drexel University and a member of the Philadelphia Fed’s Economic and Community Advisory Council, will introduce our last session that will focus on the connection between people and place and how we promote prosperity. Michael Nutter, former mayor of Philadelphia and a member of our Economic and Community Advisory Council, will join Dennis Lower of Cortex Innovation Community in St. Louis in a discussion. Amy Liu, director of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, will moderate.\n\nThe speakers are not only some of the most prominent scholars in their fields, but you may have noticed that some of them are among the Philadelphia Fed’s most valued partners. Their participation should tell you how seriously we take these issues.\n\nI also want to note that the shift in the Policy Forum is the result of the leadership of Mike Dotsey, the Philadelphia Fed’s director of research. Mike wanted to use the event as a platform for applying the same high-level, rigorous discussion of research that has always been the hallmark of the Policy Forum to advance the goals of the EGMP. I’d like to applaud Mike and his team for their hard work in organizing this event. And I’d also like to give a special shout out to Theresa Singleton and her staff, who lead the Philadelphia Fed’s community development efforts and the work of the EGMP.\n\nA special thank you as well to the members of our board, advisory councils, and our visiting scholars who are with us today. Will, Phoebe, John, and Mike, thank you for joining us. We are so grateful for your participation as leaders who care deeply about the subjects we’ll examine during this forum.\n\nDuring the day, there will be many opportunities for you, our guests, to ask questions and engage with our speakers and with each other. As you can see, audience participation is written into the agenda. I look forward to the discussions you’ll have here, and I thank you for being a part of this year’s event. If you happen to use Twitter, please join the conversation using the hashtag #PhilFedForum.\n\nA 230-year-old medical college may not seem an apt location for this policy forum. But the mission statement of this august establishment reads “to advance the science of medicine and to thereby lessen human misery.” It is that same sense of purpose and concern for humankind that bring us together today to address some of our society’s biggest challenges.\n\nThank you. And, remember, if you have time, Einstein’s brain.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]The Pew Charitable Trusts, Philadelphia’s Poor: Who they are, where they live, and how that has changed,  The Pew Charitable Trusts (2017).\n\n[2]The Pew Charitable Trusts.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. That video is a powerful reminder that the issue of financial predation doesn’t just have a financial cost; it affects health, family bonds, and overall well-being. I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge Philip Marshall for attending this conference, but more importantly, for his courage, his example, and his continued advocacy. The fact that this case was so high profile helped turn attention to the growing problem of financial exploitation of older Americans, and your sustained work has helped to keep it focused. I hope today that we will add to the conversation.\n\nBefore that conversation begins, however, I should issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile the question of protecting our older citizens is always important, it is increasingly taking on wide-ranging implications, owing to the simple math of demographics. With the boomers, we will see the largest generation in history ushered into retirement and older age. Not to mention that they are living longer than any generation before them. As a boomer myself, I think this is great news. But from both a regulatory and an economic perspective, it’s something that deserves full attention.\n\nThis conference will cover some of the key problems and conundrums of the often murky subject of financial safety for our aging population. I don’t expect that we will manage to solve each of them in the space of two days — though hope springs eternal — but I do think that this is a platform to discuss them frankly and address them head-on.\n\nThe first is to outline the scope of the issue or, in some cases, the lack of scope. While there has been some excellent research, we don’t yet have firm data on exactly how large the issue is. Estimates of the annual cost of exploitation alone range from just under $3 billion to over $36 billion.1 And that’s not necessarily taking into account the wider range of fraud.\n\nThere is also the matter of how and when victimization may be exacerbated. While the extended golden years are in and of themselves a good thing, they are often accompanied by flagging physical and cognitive health, each of which can affect both access and attention to finances, leaving people more vulnerable.\n\nAdd whatever unknown unknowns are out there to the known unknowns, and we’re in brand new territory. Without a greater understanding of its size and scope, we’re limited both in combatting the problem and knowing how effective our efforts are.\n\nLike virtually every issue of import, this is not a problem that stands in isolation. It is woven into other segments of the economy — health care, for instance, or student debt. As an example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has reported that in the decade before 2015, the number of adults over 60 taking on student loans fully quadrupled, with roughly three-quarters assumed on behalf of children and grandchildren.2 Not only does that have the potential to spill over to the real economy, it’s poised to become a multigenerational problem.\n\nI should also note the obvious, that more people living longer means more people entering retirement with plans that may have estimated a shorter life expectancy — on fixed incomes that could be further compromised by the health issues that become more common as we age. That could add to debt, and, in turn, to the possibility of default. Research from the New York Fed shows that debt held by people between 50 and 80 increased some 60 percent from 2003 to 2015.3\n\nWhile each of these factors — student debt, retirement costs, eldercare — might not be crisis inducing in and of itself, the interconnectivity could make the sum more systemically dangerous than its individual parts. It may be that the problem of elder financial exploitation is not fully contained but could spill over into the larger economy. The sheer size and complexity pose a challenge for industry and regulators alike.\n\nI don’t mean to sound alarmist, but this is a set of circumstances ripe to balloon.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it has yet, and the best guard against a future crisis is building a bulwark in the present.\n\nThat brings me to the second issue: financial institutions’ concerns about the conundrums posed by current laws and regulations. While institutions want to help protect their customers, especially vulnerable seniors, they’re worried about the legal consequences of putting holds on suspicious electronic transfers and deposits because they’re legally bound to expedite the process. They’re also reluctant to share information about potentially suspicious account activity with other institutions for fear of violating federal and state privacy laws.\n\nThat’s particularly unfortunate because we have evidence that sharing information could be a huge help. Larry Santucci just published a paper that looks at how data sharing among financial institutions could improve the financial health of older Americans, specifically those with cognitive difficulties. He’ll be discussing it tomorrow, so I urge you to stick around for day two.\n\nThere will be some relief from these regulatory concerns when the FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) rule changes go into effect next February. Brokerages will be allowed to place temporary holds on disbursements of funds or securities when they have reasonable belief that certain customers may be victims of financial exploitation. Additionally, new rules will require those institutions to make an effort to obtain names and information for trusted contacts on such customers’ accounts. But I understand that there is still more that needs to be done.\n\nThat leads me to the third issue that should be addressed today, which is banks’ engagement and responsibility on both an individual and an industry level.\n\nLike much of the other information, we are in Wild West territory regarding exactly who is pursuing solutions. And while I know that “data” isn’t the plural of “anecdote,” I am concerned that some of my research staff estimates a relatively low number of institutions actively looking for and implementing safeguards.\n\nAgain, there has been some regulatory constraint, and I understand the predicament. But I know it can be done because there is already some very good work being done by individual banks, some of which we will hear from during the course of this conference. The more we discuss the issue in venues like this, the more we can learn about best practices. It makes sense to address the problem early on, so industry can inform regulation as it develops. The interest of regulator and institution is the same here: protecting the customer.\n\nFrom our perspective, it’s the sine qua non of regulation. From the industry’s, it’s an essential business component because it’s fundamental to trust. The entire financial system, and each of its constituent parts, is dependent on consumer trust to function correctly. Getting out in front of an issue, particularly one this potentially significant, is good for everyone.\n\nAs a Fed president, I draft neither regulation nor legislation; so you’re probably thinking it’s easy to make the call when you’re not on the field. And I’m not telling anyone how to run their own organization. But I would urge everyone to study the issue and embed solutions. Share your ideas so we can learn from one another. Make working on those ideas a business priority. And finally, work together. Whether it’s a task force or a set of industry standards, finding a way to guide the solution in real time, instead of waiting for reactive regulation, is in the financial services industry’s best interest, as well as the consumer’s. In the words of an old proverb, if we don’t change our direction, we’re likely to end up where we’re headed.\n\nWith that, I’ve done enough pontificating, and I’ll relinquish the floor. Before I go, I want to say that I truly do value the industry insight and the work done by our regulatory colleagues. So thank you all for coming today and for your input. Thank you also to the team here, along with Dr. Jason Karlawish and his team at Penn Medicine, for bringing together such a great group of panelists and to everyone taking the time to present. This discussion is too important to let go quiet.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Recommendations and Report for Financial Institutions on Preventing and Responding to Elder Financial Exploitation,” March 2016, http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201603_cfpb_recommendations-and-report-for-financial-institutions-on-preventing-and-responding-to-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf.\n\n[2]https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-warns-student-loan-servicing-problems-can-jeopardize-long-term-financial-security-older-borrowers/\n\n[3]http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/02/the-graying-of-american-debt.html\n\n",

            "content": "Good morning. It truly is a pleasure to be here, and I’d like to thank our hosts for their exceptional hospitality and such exquisite surroundings. In cases like this, you feel compelled to reciprocate, by way of cultural exchange, with some emblem of your country. But I realize that some of what we hold to be quintessentially American — from blue jeans to baseball — have been so embraced, and dare I say even so improved in some cases, that they’re also quintessentially Japanese. I find, therefore, that the remaining, unique tradition I can share is this: the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, I’ll begin by noting the subject of today’s panel: How to cope with unconventional policy. I suppose this stands out to me because, while unconventional policy certainly needs to be managed and requires an adjustment by both policymakers and markets, it is, overall, a coping mechanism in and of itself. Each of us turned to these tools to address our own situations during and after the financial crisis. Unconventional policy was the salve to the crisis’s wounds.\n\nThe Road to Normal\n\nEach of us on this panel, and indeed in this room, brings a different perspective on how those policies played out. But we’re all more or less on the same path; we’re just at different points on a journey that ultimately leads to normalization. In the U.S., we’re a bit farther along than our counterparts and, as such, can be looked at as something of a test case, though the cynic might compare us instead to the canary in the proverbial coal mine. In either case, our steps so far can prove illuminating, and some of our research and discoveries may prove informative as well.\n\nThe caveat, of course, is that there are a few differences in the case of the U.S. Unlike many in this room, the U.S. did not enter into a regime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the fed funds rate to essentially zero, then engaged in three rounds of quantitative easing when rates failed to adequately spur recovery. We aren’t alone in that experience, although we are farther ahead in terms of normalization. And the last qualification: In the grand tradition of Americans retaining the imperial measurement and Fahrenheit systems, monetary policy implementation in the U.S. is just different enough than others’ to make exact translation difficult.\n\nThat said, I believe our experience can still be informative.\n\nUnconventional Policy and the Fed’s Balance Sheet\n\nAs a quick reminder, I’ll offer a brief history of U.S. monetary policy during and after the crash. When lowering rates to near-zero failed to jump-start the economy, we turned, as most of us here did, to unconventional policies, which were primarily driven by large-scale asset purchases, or LSAPs — a phrase policy wonks concede we have lost the battle on, so I’ll simply refer to the program by its better known moniker of quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nQE involved buying more and different assets than our usual practice of holding mostly short-term Treasuries. We purchased longer-term Treasuries and bought mortgage-backed securities. The balance sheet swelled to approximately $4.5 trillion, a significant increase from the roughly $900 billion balance before the onset of the crisis.\n\nSince late 2014, when we ended the purchases, we’ve been reinvesting the proceedings as they’ve reached maturity, keeping the balance sheet constant, until last month.\n\nA modest rate hike in December of 2015 signaled the first baby steps toward normalization. We’ve since raised them three more times, by 25 basis points each time, and I still have another 25 basis point rate increase penciled in for this year, although perhaps I should say, “lightly penciled in.”\n\nUnwinding\n\nThat, of course, is not the only mechanism by which normalization must occur. In our September FOMC meeting, we voted to start the process of unwinding the balance sheet, commencing last month. The size of the balance sheet is larger than we’ve ever seen, and the MBS in particular renders its makeup different than before the crisis. Current assets are made up primarily of those Treasuries and MBS, while the liability side overwhelmingly consists of paper currency and bank reserves and balances and, to a much lesser extent, the overnight reverse repurchase — or reverse repo — facility.\n\nIt’s true that we haven’t faced exactly this type of normalization before — no one has — but it’s also true that it’s unlikely to be remotely interesting as a policy event, except as a chapter in some future generation’s economics textbook. It will be slow, deliberate, boring, and essentially on autopilot.\n\nTo look at what we’ve done — and are planning to do — and to consider what lessons that could hold for other central banks, we should go back to first principles.\n\n“Why,” for instance, is a legitimate question. It is possible to maintain an exorbitantly large balance sheet and let the growth of the economy eventually render it proportional.\n\nFrom my perspective, removing accommodation is the right next step for a few reasons. Monetary policy in the United States has been very accommodative for close to a decade. The economy now is more or less at full strength: There’s very little slack left in the labor market and growth has kept pace with our projections. Inflation is still below the Fed’s target rate and is the one area that not only continues to elicit caution, it even constitutes a conundrum … I won’t get into too much detail, but some work by my staff suggests that the Phillips curve has not been a good predictor of inflation over the past several decades.1 I do think we have to be cautious, therefore, about how we’re measuring inflation. At the same time, I don’t advocate throwing out all conventional economic positions with the bathwater. With a labor market this tight, inflation is likely to reassert itself at some point. All of which is to say that as we near the point of full health, it makes sense to return policy to a more normal stance.\n\nThis is also about keeping our powder dry. In the event of another shock to the system, I want our tools to be at their most effective and, in my view, that means reducing our balance sheet. Additionally, as productivity has dropped, it’s taken the neutral funds rate with it, making the zero lower bound closer and resulting in less room for maneuver with the funds rate, which will continue to be our primary monetary policy tool.\n\nIn the case of rates returning to zero, then, if something were to happen — if another crisis were to occur — further asset purchases may prove less effective, or perhaps simply more difficult and costly to execute, with a large balance sheet still in place.\n\nThe famous line is that the Fed takes away the punch bowl just as the party is getting good. I don’t think we’re taking away the bowl; I think we’re making sure there’s enough punch for the future.\n\nSlow, Predictable, and Utterly Unexciting\n\nIn making the decision to start bringing the balance sheet back into alignment, three aspects were crucial. How to do it was obviously top of mind but also how to ensure a slow, steady pace that could essentially be left to churn on its own. We also knew, from past experience, that communicating our intentions was going to be a key factor in the efforts.\n\nThe means of unwinding the balance sheet were straightforward: We could either stop reinvesting the securities as they come to maturity or sell them on the open market. We opted for the former, with gradually increasing caps on the amounts that are not reinvested. This ensures the crucial aspects of gradual, predictable, and boring that we’re aiming for.\n\nThis is not to say that we will ignore the process as it unfolds. We’ll keep a watchful eye and revisit it in meetings. If economic or other events necessitate intervention, we’ll make that call. But we fundamentally want this to slowly and mechanically happen in the background.\n\nI’ve said before that this will be the policy equivalent of watching paint dry. But I should specify that the paint is oil based; the process is going to take some time. We have not yet established what the new normal will look like.\n\nThe balance sheet will definitely be bigger than it was before the crisis because the economy is bigger. But its eventual size will depend on how overnight and other short-term rates behave as the unwinding progresses.\n\nAlso vital to our plans is the sense of predictability. I’m not sure there’s a single Fed employee, from president to examiner, who didn’t take the lessons of the 2013 taper tantrum to heart. Regarding unwinding then, we made every effort to communicate early and often, and as clearly as possible — a feat for an organization renowned for its policy speak — to ensure the message was clear. The market response to the announcement was somewhere between a yawn and a shrug, so I really do have to commend the entire Fed System for the clarity and consistency of the message. It’s one of the key successes I’d point to in managing normalization after such an extraordinary time.\n\nKey Lessons\n\nThere are other lessons to be gleaned, not just from the progress on the balance sheet, but from the moment of liftoff.\n\nOne of the most important is that, in the normalization process, it’s possible to manage the balance sheet and rates separately, albeit with limits.\n\nWhen we ended QE in late 2014, serious questions were posed about the feasibility of raising rates, given the size of the balance sheet. Traditionally, the New York Fed’s markets units that implement the policy — which we refer to simply as “the Desk” — implemented rate increases by making reserves scarce in the fed funds market. But more than $2 trillion of reserves rendered them anything but scarce. The only way the Desk could remove $2 trillion of reserves overnight would be by effectively holding the largest fire sale in economic history.\n\nThe current situation necessitated a great deal of effort to gain a deep understanding of uncharted waters. Ultimately, a combination of expertise and analysis engineered a successful liftoff in December 2015. Rates have been under control since and remain well connected to other money markets. As the FOMC decides to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, it increases both the interest banks earn on reserves and the rate an extended list of counterparties can earn via the reverse repo facility.\n\nHere I’ll return to the note I made earlier that the United States differs in a few areas. In the classic model of a corridor system, the interest on reserves provides a floor, for the obvious reason that no bank wants to lend at a lower rate than it would earn by simply keeping its balances. In the U.S., however, not all institutions qualify to earn interest on reserves. With reserve markets satiated, it is therefore the reverse repos — available to a wider range of additional institutions — that provide a firm floor on market rates and the interest on reserves provides a cap.\n\nThese two rates — interest on reserves and reverse repos — currently form the boundaries of the fed funds target. Research by my staff correctly predicted that most fed funds trades would occur at rates safely in the middle of the target range, even if actual use of reverse repos is quite low. By offering an alternative to trades in the market, the reverse repo facility improves the bargaining position of lenders and drives rates, even if lenders rarely have to resort to the facility — a “spooky action at a distance” that also helps to keep the fed funds rate connected to other money market rates.2\n\nAs our balance sheet declines, so does the supply of reserves. Eventually, reserves could become scarce again, which would, theoretically, make it possible to return to a classic corridor system in which interest on reserves operates as a firm floor on market rates. Exactly what level of reserves would enable that is a topic of ongoing research. That level could be substantially larger than the last time we conducted policy in a reserves-scarce environment, owing to how much has changed since 2008. I will therefore continue to monitor this issue as the balance sheet shrinks.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is, by and large, farther down the road to normal than other countries that turned to unconventional policies and, as such, we can pass along the lessons of our experiences thus far. These are clearly not direct correlations, but there are echoes, and we all operate on the fundamental monetary policy oath of “first do no harm.”\n\nThe knowledge that rates and the balance sheet can be decoupled has been invaluable, as has the work to prepare the markets for what’s to come.\n\nThis is a new path for all of us. What we’re trying has never been done before, at least not on this scale, and while it might be, to borrow a phrase, the “final frontier” of monetary policy, I do believe we’ll pull off the ultimate feat and make a couple trillion dollars utterly uninteresting.\n\nWith that, I’m happy to take any questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Michael Dotsey, Shigeru Fujita, and Tom Stark, “Do Phillips Curves Conditionally Help to Forecast Inflation?” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 17-26, August 2017.\n\n[2]Roc Armenter and Ben Lester, “Excess Reserves and Monetary Policy Implementation,” Review of Economic Dynamics, 23, (2017), pp. 212–235.",

            "content": "Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today.\n\nSome speeches start with jokes. Fed speeches start with a disclaimer: The views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to say how great it is to have such a diverse group of stakeholders here. The Fed brings a lot of research and talent to bear in the community development sphere, but we’re only as successful as our partners make us, so thank you.\n\nI think all of us have questions we’re asked regularly about our jobs. When I was in academia, that was mostly, “Can I have an extension?” The ones I hear now, other than “When are you raising rates?” often fall into the category of “Why does the Fed care about equitable transit? Why do you care about affordable housing? What does community development have to do with monetary policy?”\n\nAnd I suppose on its face, it may not be evident. But the American economy is not a monolith; it’s a collection of regions and businesses and households that are themselves a series of microeconomies making up the whole. We are stronger as a country when every link in that chain is economically sound. Ensuring that all our communities are economically stable and sustainable is important to everyone.\n\nAs for the rest of it — things like housing and transportation — they are the factors that help turn economic aspiration into reality.\n\nWhich is why we’re here today. I’m an engineer by training, by the way, so I can talk about transportation for hours. People already think Fed presidents are boring policy wonks. Imagine getting stuck next to me at dinner parties, expounding on the wonders of bus routes … But I have actually managed to get people to listen because transit-related issues can affect so many other economic factors.\n\nEconomic Growth & Mobility Project\n\nAs you all probably know, the Philadelphia Fed has launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project that looks for practical applications for research. In fact, this summit on equitable transit is part of our first Research in Action project. I’d normally save the “thank yous” until the end of my remarks, but we wouldn’t be here today without our partners. So, for making this possible, a quick note of thanks to our partners in forming the Equitable Transit Council, the Scranton Area Community Foundation, and Laura Ducceschi, its president and CEO. Thank you also to Teri Ooms, executive director of The Institute for Public Policy and Economic Development at Wilkes University. And thanks to all the members of the Equitable Transit Council for your commitment to collaboration.\n\nBack to the Economic Growth & Mobility Project. The EGMP focuses on three key areas: job creation, workforce development, and infrastructure.\n\nWe often refer to these as the three legs of the mobility stool, but we could also call them strands of DNA because they’re inextricably laced and are core parts of mobility’s being.\n\nWe can have the best workforce development in the world, and we can create jobs at lightning pace. But if people can’t afford to live near the training, or find a way to get to the jobs, it won’t do much good. We have to look at the whole picture, not just what we need to get the economy moving, but how to make it happen. A central focus is, obviously, jobs, and we’re dealing with a few different issues in the labor market right now.\n\nFirst, not everyone is looking at the same employment realities. On a national level, there’s very little slack left in the labor market. Unemployment is at 4.2 percent, and the other data — for instance, job openings and quits — also point to a pretty tight market. But that’s a national average, and there are areas around the country that don’t share that good fortune.\n\nSecond, in a market that’s tight overall, we wind up with a different problem: Employers can’t find workers with the right skills. If they can’t fill those positions, they can’t expand their businesses, and that affects growth.\n\nThird, we are dealing with a low labor force participation rate. And as the baby boomers continue their march into retirement — and continue to live longer, to which I say “Go, boomers!” — the United States will have more people needing more services for more time. And while the millennial generation is technically a bit bigger, they’re not all fully in the workforce yet, and even the oldest aren’t quite in their prime earning years. Research by my staff shows that the labor force participation rate, which is currently just above 63 percent, will likely drop a couple more tenths of a percentage point over the next few years. Since growth is fundamentally growth in productivity plus growth in the labor force, there’s a real incentive for us to get every last person off the sidelines that we possibly can.\n\nWe need to get workers to jobs. We need to get potential workers to training. We need to reach as many of them as possible. And we need to do it in an equitable way. Which brings us back to the subject of transportation.\n\nEquitable Transportation and Economic Health\n\nWhile transit is a central issue for everyone’s economic health, the issues with transit aren’t the same for everyone. They vary by geography and size, by resources and need.\n\nNortheastern Pennsylvania, like the rest of the country, has a transportation system that grew in the latter half of the 20th century. Those systems reflected the way we lived: We moved to the suburbs and worked in the city and therefore, reasonably, designed systems to bring people into and out of the city center. Now that jobs are booming in distribution centers and office parks on the outskirts of town, we need to rethink how those systems can get people to jobs.\n\nOf course, jobs aren’t the only issue. There are other ways transportation impacts people’s lives and their path to economic growth and mobility. Prosperity is more than a number on a balance sheet. To be fully economically healthy, we need to take into account all aspects of a person or family or community’s assets that aren’t numerically or monetarily defined. Things like access to quality health care and education affect our ability to move up the economic ladder as well. So it’s important to get people to jobs but also to doctors’ appointments and school and the grocery store.\n\nIf you live in a city with a large transportation system and lots of options, it’s easy to forget that in substantial portions of the country, if you don’t have a car, you’re out of luck. But even in larger metro areas, equitable transit is an issue. There was an article in the New York Times a few months ago about the effect of skyrocketing real estate prices pushing people farther and farther from where they work. A woman they profiled in the Bay Area leaves home at 4:00 a.m. to start work at 7:00. Another article this summer, about the New York metro area, was titled, “You Have a Bad Commute? Try Four Hours and Three Trains.”\n\nThe benefit in this region is that we have the ability to be nimble. We don’t have legacy infrastructure to redesign and adapt on the scale a larger area does. I can tell you from experience; I spent a summer in college working in the New York City subway. This was back in 1980, and I lived down in the tunnels from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for the entire summer, running prototypes of upgraded subway cars. Even back then, we had to work to update an old network. Since the existing infrastructure here is not as broad, we have the opportunity to imagine a more perfect system without those constraints. We have the ability to build an equitable system that works for everyone. We may have the challenge that most areas face of balancing budgets while trying to meet user needs, but we also have the space to be creative and agile. And while the budgetary issues are not insignificant, there are great examples of public-private partnerships out there as well as investment opportunities for the private sector.\n\nThere’s also great potential in operating as a region. This is something I think is important, particularly in the context of infrastructure development. We don’t all live and work in the same place; our lives and economic fates cross city and county and state lines all the time. With a region comprising three principal cities — Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton — as well as many boroughs and towns in between, that connection and collaboration is even more critical.\n\nSo, as we look to use our assets to build a better system, what are users’ needs? We’ve been working with a range of partners to figure out how to best serve the people of northeastern Pennsylvania, including running focus groups in partnership with Wilkes University. The feedback was important to understanding what and where the needs are.\n\nWe heard that users’ top destinations are health care and shopping and that the inability to get out to the industrial parks and distribution centers is hurting job prospects. We also heard that schedules are an issue, which makes sense. Not everyone works 9 to 5.\n\nAs we develop new systems in response to those needs, we have an opportunity to be a model for other areas. In such a large and diverse country, we can’t always use the same approaches — Scranton and San Francisco have very different requirements. But Scranton and Stockton might not. There are areas across the map that can learn from our future successes.\n\nResearch in Action\n\nThat’s one reason Research in Action is central to our Economic Growth & Mobility Project. We want to take the data and apply them to problems in our District but also have those areas serve as models for others.\n\nMy team has done a lot of research in conjunction with the Atlanta and Cleveland Feds on what they call “opportunity occupations,” jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require a traditional four-year college degree. They know what industries those jobs are in and where they are geographically. This is going to be central to the work we’re doing here — not just getting people to jobs but getting people to good jobs.\n\nThey’re also working to put numbers behind the question of how public transit impacts job access. They’re mapping the footprint of the existing transit networks and looking at how access to opportunity occupations using those networks varies across neighborhoods with different income and educational attainment levels.\n\nAdditionally, since we know that budget constraints are an issue for a lot of areas, our researchers have assembled examples of investment by financial institutions that meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements, which can help bring funders and partners to the table. One is a Cars for Careers partnership between a bank and a local nonprofit in the D.C. area. The bank provides affordable loans to low- and moderate-income clients to buy used cars that have been donated to the program. Another institution in Oregon is donating tax credits to the local public transit system and free dial-a-ride transportation for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nI said at the beginning of my remarks that the issues at the center of economic growth and mobility are intertwined and inextricable from the overall economic health of a region. They also have effects that span farther than each individual.\n\nTransportation is essential to getting most people to jobs, and a region with low unemployment is stronger economically. A wider revenue base can mean more investment in education and infrastructure, and it can mean more investment in the community — which, in turn, can bring in more businesses and encourage more economic growth.\n\nTransportation can also be central to health care and education. That’s the current and rising American workforce, and keeping people healthy and educated will make that workforce stronger.\n\nTransportation is not, obviously, the only aspect of infrastructure that affects economic health, but it is significant and it touches many others. And the work we’re doing in northeastern Pennsylvania will help us here and serve as a model for others.\n\nWith that, I’m happy to take any questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you.\n\nThat’s honestly one of the most impactful parts of being a Fed president: getting to see the real-life implications of the data I view on a daily basis and how it translates into life in my District and around the country. Talking to employers and job seekers and educators just resonates more than a line on a graph.\n\nI’m going to talk today about several different aspects of workforce development, each of which can truly bring about phenomenal results. And I don’t necessarily have a favorite program or approach, but sometimes the work speaks to you on a personal level.\n\nThe video you just saw was of the Philly Shipyard’s apprenticeship program. You may have heard me say that I grew up in a family of steamfitters and pipefitters. My brother was a welder, my uncles were all pipefitters, as was my dad for a long time.\n\nI saw how those jobs, those careers, gave people solid, middle-class lives, even without a college degree. I’m the result of that. I’m the beneficiary of a time and a place that offered a host of railways to the terminus of financial security. What you saw in that video was a program that can provide exactly that opportunity for this next generation of Americans. You saw people from all walks of life. Samantha, the young woman, has a B.F.A.; she’s a former artist. You saw that they were of all different ages — Shawn started the program in his 40s. And most of all, you saw that each of them feels an incredible world of opportunity is open to them because of this apprenticeship program. It’s not just a job, it’s a career — all of those people see a clear path up the company ladder. At a time when a lot of people have lost hope that fortune can favor anyone without a traditional four-year degree, it’s heartening to see those prospects alive and well.\n\nIt’s not all about the workers, however. On the flip side, companies can increase quality and output by stocking their ranks with incredibly skilled people. As people learn, adapt, and acquire new skills, the program can hone in on ways to make outcomes even better. And overall, organizations can minimize their risk by knowing they’ve got highly trained, expert tradespeople making up their workforce.\n\nIt’s a win-win.\n\nSo apprenticeships aren’t necessarily my favorite of all the workforce development approaches we’ll talk about over the course of this conference, but they do have a special place for me.\n\nIn light of that personal observation, let me assure you, with the familiar Fed disclaimer, that all the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Research\n\nSo, why am I here today? They don’t just trot out the presidents at these events, they make us earn it …\n\nAnd I’m here to talk about a really substantive report we’ve just released as a System, Investing in America’s Workforce: Report on Workforce Development Needs and Opportunities.\n\nThe impetus for this research was the CRA clarification that allows banks to include workforce development as an investment opportunity. And I want to stress that word: investment. Because I’m going to be using it a lot over the next 20 minutes or so.\n\nThis report is essentially about the value of investing in our combined economic future. So whether this work is directly relevant to someone, we all have a lot to gain from its success.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment — ultimately, we’re creating the conditions for economic growth. But those conditions won’t be as fertile if we can’t fill the jobs that are out there now, not to mention the ones coming in the future. The U.S. can only reach its potential when the needs of both business and the labor force are addressed in stronger alignment. So, we took a deep dive into what’s happening now and what we need to plan for the future.\n\nCommunity Development teams from across the Federal Reserve System gathered information in more than 50 listening sessions, across 32 states and Puerto Rico, from almost 1,000 workforce development leaders who work at the intersection of training, recruitment, and finance.\n\nMy team used qualitative research methods to find central themes from industry respondents: They talked about the challenges they’ve observed across the country but also the promising strategies they see as well as opportunities for investment in workforce development.\n\nA lot of the findings reflect what we see in the data and what we’re hearing from our community and business contacts across the country.\n\nBut what makes this report stand out is the approaches they used. It let them take a deep and broad look at the insights shared by using a rigorous, qualitative research method.\n\nFor me, the methodology and the findings confirm the unique role of Community Development in the Fed System.\n\nI often make the observation that while we make monetary policy on a national level, that’s the 30,000-foot vantage point. It’s a combined view of myriad microeconomies made up of regions and businesses and households. That’s why our decentralized system is so important: It allows us to really understand our Districts and their specific needs on an in-depth, local level.\n\nThat same understanding of the unique needs of the communities we serve is what makes the Community Development function so crucial and what adds so much value. They’ve got depth and breadth of understanding and an interconnected system of networks that provides insight on this vast and diverse collection of economies.\n\nChallenges in the Workforce\n\nSo, what are we working with?\n\nA lot of what we heard in the listening sessions reflects what I see in the data. The JOLTS data, for instance, and the Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey (MBOS), both show a skills gap. The MBOS shows that compared with 2014, the respondents identifying a labor shortage this year jumped from about 33 percent to over 60 percent. And the ones who saw a skills mismatch went from about 46 percent to around 68 percent.\n\nOf course, there are other issues. Everyone here is familiar with the factors that impact or limit people’s ability to enter the workforce, to find jobs that can support a family, or even to progress up the career ladder.\n\nThis report highlighted some of the factors we know contribute to these hurdles. They include the skills gap I mentioned, low educational attainment or poor quality of education, and a change in employer needs and demands due to increasing automation and technical advancement.\n\nThe research also highlighted the barriers that aren’t related to skills, like addiction, incarceration, child-care costs.\n\nThere are also logistical impediments; in the case of housing and insufficient transportation — the simple consequence of place.\n\nAnd there is the issue of job quality. While we’re essentially at the point of maximum employment — in its simplest terms, if you want a job, you can get one relatively easily — that doesn’t mean it’s a good job, or that it pays a living wage, or that it comes with the benefits that can be truly family-sustaining.\n\nThis situation doesn’t actually keep people from work, but it does affect their ability to move up the economic ladder.\n\nAnd that’s not just a problem for individuals, families, and communities but for the economy as a whole.\n\nLooking at these barriers, they’re each a brick in the wall, one that stands between people and either sustainable employment or economic mobility.\n\nSo, how do we chip away at the bricks? How do we knock that wall down?\n\nWhat we heard in the listening sessions, and what a lot of experts and practitioners say, is that there needs to be a change in perspective.\n\nThat shift in thinking is going to be a theme because, sometimes, it’s all about how we view things. When we change the way we look at things, those things can start to change. None of us is static, and none of us can view our work or our challenges through a single lens. The research showed that experts truly believe that a change in thinking will lead to a change in behavior, which can lead to a change in outcomes.\n\nThe Shift in Thinking: Public Sector\n\nSo, what for instance, would that mean for the public sector?\n\nWe heard consistently, and it is a central theme in the report, that we have got to stop looking at workforce development as just a social service. I mean everyone. We need to look at it for what it is: an investment in the American economy.\n\nIf we stop looking at workforce development as a cost and start looking at the long-term return on investment, we can change the conversation and the approaches.\n\nFrom a purely economic standpoint, early childhood education isn’t an expenditure; it’s an investment in our future workforce. It’s an investment in the next generation of entrepreneurs and health-care workers and teachers.\n\nLikewise, investing in workforce development doesn’t just benefit individuals; it helps create the workforce our businesses need.\n\nIf we ignore that investment opportunity, we aren’t just losing the economic resources; we’re likely creating a cohort that could actually be a cost.\n\nIn the same vein, we heard that we need to better align overlapping goals, like workforce development and economic development efforts. Or investing in intermediaries that connect people to jobs — not just the ones that train workers but the ones that train with an eye on what the industry’s future needs will be.\n\nAnd one of the key messages we heard was that people involved in this work need to start thinking like investors who look at long-term outcomes, rather than lenders that look at short-term risks.\n\nInvestors succeed when the company they’re backing does well. The U.S. economy succeeds when we back programs that move people out of poverty and into stable, sustainable employment.\n\nAnd when we shift to an investor mindset, it creates opportunities for financial institutions to become strategic partners.\n\nFor example, there’s a new fund in Philadelphia that allows banks to work with a CDFI intermediary to drive capital to early childhood education. This is important because we know it’s a two-generation strategy: helping the working generation find steady employment and knowing their children are getting the skills they need to be successful now and in the future.\n\nThe Shift in Thinking: Private Sector\n\nSo, what shift in thinking would they like to see in the private sector? Employers looking at their workers as assets to be invested in, rather a line-item labor cost to be limited or decreased. If employers do that, our experts believe their behavior might also change.\n\nThey may increase incumbent worker training or professional development opportunities. Those approaches both increase the skills of their current workforce and, as people start to move up within an organization, create entry-level positions to bring in a new generation of talent.\n\nIt could also encourage apprenticeship programs and work-based training. We know from experience that we’re especially successful when people can learn and earn, supporting their families while increasing their skills.\n\nSo, if private sector partners can shift their thinking, we’re more likely to see an increase in job quality, which is important. We’re in a tight labor market right now, but we aren’t creating quality jobs within that market; we won’t see as big of an economic impact.\n\nWhat did our listening session participants want from the financial institution side? They suggested favorable funding so businesses can invest in their workforce, which in turn can contribute to the overall virtuous economic cycle. In California, for example, lenders are providing reduced-cost capital to businesses that are committed to improving job quality over time or offering quality jobs.\n\nThe Shift in Thinking: Philanthropy\n\nAnd what did we hear from the philanthropic side? An invitation to be bold. Because philanthropy has the freedom to use real ingenuity.\n\nFoundations can use their capital to promote innovation, collaboration, and capacity building; they can be venture philanthropists.\n\nWe know that shifting thinking and perspectives isn’t always easy. We also know that it’s often not lack of funding — but lack of risk tolerance — that stops new approaches and innovations. Philanthropy is the group that’s able to take on that risk and prove best practices. They can be the catalysts for innovation and capacity building across the community development field.\n\nIf they can be the ones to bring their risk appetite up a notch, take the lead on facilitating increased collaboration and capacity building, and use those to prove best practices, they may be able to leverage additional investment based on solid track records.\n\nWe heard from a lot of people that there’s a need for this kind of leadership and support to address challenges the best way the respondents see: holistically.\n\nInstead of having very restrictive capital and rigid reporting requirements, organizations can be empowered to think about how they’re investing and building capacity to meet the needs of their clients, the same way venture capitalists would invest in the capacity of businesses they want to succeed.\n\nSo, instead of paying for services or funding services, they’re funding outcomes. And by doing that, we’re giving organizations flexibility and trust and the space to better meet the unique needs of their clients. Those organizations can become more nimble, more sustainable, and able to operate more effectively in the context of the complex challenges they’re facing.\n\nThis is also an opportunity for lenders to provide impact because they, rightfully, have to think about limiting risk. They can’t take on the more adventurous investments that foundations can, but they can support the capacity building that organizations need by offering flexible financial products.\n\nFor example, we heard that in order to effectively train people for the jobs of today and tomorrow, one of the pressing needs is cutting-edge, high-tech equipment. Which is expensive. So banks offering affordable financing can help organizations meet those challenges.\n\nConclusions and Next Steps\n\nThose challenges aren’t small. We wouldn’t all be here if they were. But the changes in perspective we heard overwhelmingly in our research, the different approaches we all talk about wanting, can yield game-changing results.\n\nRemember the barriers? The bricks that fit together to make the wall higher and harder to scale?\n\nIf we change the way we look at it, we see how it might change.\n\nClimbing isn’t necessarily easy. But with the insight we’ve already heard today; with the approaches our research participants highlighted; and with the capacity and talent of stakeholders from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors, we can absolutely turn that wall on its side.\n\nThose steps form the ascendant path of economic mobility, and they’re a climb everyone should have a chance at.\n\nAs many of you know, we’ve recently launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project at the Philadelphia Fed, and this is exactly what we’re focused on.\n\nIn addition to our work on the Investing in America’s Workforce report, we recently released an apprenticeship guide for business. We are also currently exploring ways to put some of the investment opportunities we’ve found through this research into action in the Third District.\n\nI truly believe we’ll have people lining up to partner in this work if we can change people’s perspectives. I met with a group of CEOs last week, and they confirmed that this is work the business community is crying out for.\n\nBefore I turn it over to questions, I obviously can’t end without the requisite, and well-deserved, shout-outs. To our colleagues across the System who hosted listening sessions and collaborated on this research: They’ve all done an incredible job contributing to the report. And to my team, of course; in particular, Theresa Singleton for her leadership and Noelle St.Clair for all her work on this report.\n\nI also want to thank our other colleagues across the Federal Reserve System and at the Board of Governors, our partners in the room today and those that couldn’t make it out to Austin, and those who have given their time and insight throughout the conference by speaking and sharing their work. I’m looking forward to the rest of it.\n\nWith that, I’m more than happy to take some questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Hello and welcome; it’s great to have everyone here.\n\nI’m going to keep my remarks to a minimum today, but I do want to take some time to express what I think is truly one of the most important areas of modern economic research. Which, being just one of the many opinions I’m going to share in the next 10 minutes, is a good place to stop to deliver the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIn 2001, one of my predecessors stood on this very stage at the first Consumer Transactions and Credit conference, making the case for the newly launched Payment Cards Center (PCC). Today, I’ll be making the case for that center’s evolution. In some ways, there may as well be a century and a half, rather than a decade and a half, separating our two discussions. In others, some messages from that conference still resonate today.\n\nReading Anthony Santomero’s remarks with the benefit of 16 years’ perspective is a lesson in the power of research and, given the prescience of his case, something of an exercise in humility.\n\nHis view back then was that individuals’ use of consumer credit and payments had been relatively neglected in the research community. That was starting to change with the emergence of ever more complex financial vehicles, particularly relating to the mortgage market. But, by and large, he said we were still a long way from a sophisticated model of household decisions on spending, saving, borrowing, and allocation of assets. He said that “In short, the detailed payoff patterns associated with the debt instruments issued by the agent were entirely too mundane for the theorists’ consideration.”\n\nWhat a difference a few years would make and how much we all wish those instruments had actually been mundane.\n\nToday, the place of consumer credit and payments, and its attendant research, is markedly different than it was in 2001. But the foundation of the Philadelphia Fed’s continued focus remains the same: The Third District is home to the credit card industry, and we have years of research and expertise dedicated to the study of all things consumer.\n\nSo today, I’m incredibly pleased to say that we’re building on that legacy and the work of the Payment Cards Center by launching the Consumer Finance Institute (CFI).\n\nThis is an evolution rather than a rebranding or a new initiative. The Payment Cards Center will contribute to the CFI, along with researchers in our Supervision, Regulation, and Credit; Community Development Studies & Education; and Research departments. Our goal is to make the Consumer Finance Institute a primary source within the Federal Reserve System for consumer finance data and research.\n\nI hold the relatively straightforward belief that we should play to our strengths, and this expansion is an expression not only of the importance of consumer finance but the skill and expertise of our staff.\n\nWe’ve built on the great work of Bob Hunt, Julia Cheney, and the team in the PCC and created a new consumer finance section in our Economic Research group, led by Satyajit Chatterjee. Chatty will be joined by Wenli Li, and I’d like to take a moment to welcome Igor Livshits and Andrew Hertzberg. Just a plug for our fantastic research team, and a thanks for their work. I’d advise everyone to look out for Andrew’s upcoming article in The Journal of Finance. It’s a great example of how the close study of household behavior — in this case, understanding that households are actually made up of interdependent individuals — gives us valuable, and surprising, insights into consumption behavior. That’s important on a number of levels but particularly from my perspective as a monetary policymaker.\n\nWhich leads me to something I find so surprising about Anthony Santomero’s words not too many years ago. The absence of a fully developed field of robust research on consumer credit fundamentally indicates that we didn’t acknowledge that it touches every aspect of the economy. Consumer issues are intertwined and interwoven, inextricable from virtually every economic issue. From entitlement programs to business formation to health care, as Nathan Blascak is going to present later today, there’s nothing in the economy consumer credit doesn’t touch.\n\nPerhaps it’s simply more stark in the wake of the financial crisis and its aftermath, but it seems to me there’s no way to look at the economy without factoring in the work and research you all are doing.\n\nSo I’m going to let you get on with that discussion, now that I’ve shamelessly plugged all the great work of the staff here at the Philadelphia Fed. I want to thank the conference organizers, who reviewed 140 submissions this year, and Mike Dotsey, our director of Research, for his role in overseeing the CFI and realigning some of his research team to work in such an important area.\n\nWith that, thanks for coming and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning. It’s truly a pleasure to be here, and I want to extend my sincerest thanks to everyone who made today possible. This is an incredibly important topic, and the more people we can bring to the table, the better. There’s been a growing interest in apprenticeships in the area — in everything from IT to health care to financial services — and their success is a testament to the power of public-private partnerships.\n\nI’m going to do something a bit different today. Normally, the policymaker would get up and recite key statistics, which, frankly, is our comfort zone. You notice no one ever calls a monetary policymaker to host the Tonys.\n\nAnd while it’s not quite a Broadway number — the only one I’m qualified for is Hamilton, and believe me, you don’t want to hear me in a rap battle over central banking — I’m going to leave the heavy data to today’s expert presenters. I will, of course, address workforce development from a policy perspective, but I’m also going to add a bit of the personal. Which counts as really shaking things up in Fed world.\n\nThat’s the segue to the reason I’m here: Why, exactly, does the Fed care about workforce development?\n\nI should note that the answer to that question — along with everything else I say today — reflects my thoughts alone and not necessarily anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWith that duly noted, there are actually a few reasons I care about workforce development. For one, it helps the Fed meet one of the goals set for us by Congress: maximum employment. For another, a better educated and more skilled workforce benefits us all, whether it’s more innovation, better goods and services, or additional revenue flowing into the economy. But there’s also my sincere belief that everyone should have a fair shot at success. That means developing skills that can help them get there, and apprenticeships are a critical tool.\n\nI think all areas of training are important, but I’m especially focused on how we address the changing landscape of the American workforce at a pivotal time in history. Now, to be fair, “pivotal time in history” is probably one of the most overused speech lines out there. But I honestly believe we’re experiencing a confluence of events that makes the needs and challenges of the labor market unique to our time. We’ve endured the biggest crisis since the Great Depression, and we’re finally emerging from its shadow. We’re seeing demographic changes — like the first wave of baby boom retirements — that are fundamentally altering the composition of the labor force. We’re in the midst of sustained technological change that has indeed disrupted many industries, with apologies for using a buzzword. And we’re seeing a skills gap that’s affecting employers and job seekers alike.\n\nWhile there’s some debate over the extent of the gap, research by my staff shows it is a real issue, even in a labor market with very little slack left. And while data are not, I admit, the plural of anecdote, I’ve been hearing it from employers across the region as well. They have jobs but can’t find people with the skills to fill them. Meanwhile, there are people who’d love the work but don’t have the training to qualify.\n\nSkills training in general, and apprenticeships in particular, can help to address this gap. We need more investment, and more involvement, to truly make a difference. And we need a cultural shift as well. That won’t necessarily be easy — as someone who spent a lifetime in academia, I can attest to the difficulty of cultural change — but it is definitely necessary.\n\nSomething that’s characterized America since our inception is that we’re incredibly creative. We excel at industries as varied as the physical landscape of the country. We’ve revolutionized so many sectors, and every day we see more examples of how we’re adapting our ways and methods of working to keep up with that change. Yet at the same time, we’ve become more and more rigid about the paths to success. We seem to be locked into the idea that the only way to access and advance in a career is through a four-year degree.\n\nThat has to change.\n\nThere are many ways to acquire skills. We know now more than ever that people learn in different ways. Not everyone is programmed to pick up information in a classroom setting. Not everyone wants or needs or should get a traditional bachelor’s degree. And not everyone who wants one needs to do so immediately.\n\nAnd that’s OK. That’s good. We need to stack our workforce with people who think and solve and learn differently. Apprenticeships aren’t just an alternative; they’re a smart, first-choice path, and we should view them that way. They’ve stood the test of time for a reason.\n\nApprenticeships go back to ancient Egypt and Babylon; they were so important they were enshrined in the Code of Hammurabi back in the 18th century BC.\n\nFrom the late middle ages, apprenticeships guaranteed a path to employment and maintenance or rise in social status. They were a hallmark of the Renaissance and made an important economic contribution during one of the great periods in human history.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was an apprentice; so were George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Paul Revere. There is incredible nobility and history there, and we should celebrate that.\n\nApprenticeships have changed and adapted to the needs of shifting economic landscapes over time. But some things have persisted, and they are important. First, apprenticeships can be a path to economic mobility. The road from apprenticeship to journeyman to artisan is as viable today as it was in da Vinci’s time. Second, the required concentration on skill not only maintains the quality of a trade, it fosters the kind of expertise that can lead to innovation.\n\nThe change in attitudes I’d like to see was evident when I visited Roxborough High School last year. They have an Academies program that allows students to pick a course of concentration while they study the regular curriculum. It’s not an apprenticeship program but shares some of the characteristics, including setting the students up to enter the workforce directly from high school. They can earn a good salary if they want to work for a few years before returning to school, they can work part-time while continuing their education, or they can just start their climb up the professional ladder immediately. Programs like this are a great entryway to what my staff has termed “opportunity occupations”: jobs that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a college degree. They did research with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds to identify not just where this work is in terms of sector but actually where they are geographically.\n\nThe students at Roxborough know that the skills they’re getting give them a leg up in the job market, and I hope that their attitudes toward creative paths to education and training will soon be the prevailing ones. We all have our own ways of getting to the endpoint, and, if we want our labor market running on all cylinders, we need a workforce that is as innovative and creative as the sectors they represent.\n\nOne of the great things about apprenticeships is that they’re useful at any stage in life. I visited Philly Shipyard a few weeks ago, which has one of the most well-established programs in the region, and met apprentices in their 20s and 30s. One of them was Samantha, who went to art school and has a B.F.A. But she decided she wanted to go down a different path and joined the apprenticeship program. She’s now one of the top welders. Her creative and innovative talents as an artist translated into incredible skill at welding. She loves what she does and, almost as importantly, sees real growth potential and opportunity in the company.\n\nShe and the rest of the apprentices aren’t just getting the skills to become masters of their trade; they’re getting the sanctuary of seeing a solid path to not just stability but success.\n\nI grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood in New Jersey, where my sister and I were the first in our family to go to college. I could tell you that back then, you could get a high school diploma, or go to community college, and still live a comfortable, middle-class life — and that was definitely true for some people. But it wasn’t true for everyone; some people never had the access to that security or had to work twice as hard. And it’s frankly less achievable for most people now. But I still think it should be a path available to everyone.\n\nIt’s probably more resonant coming off the July 4 holiday, but the core ethos of the American dream — that if you work hard, you can get ahead — is still something quite profound. We just need better ways for people to get there. Skills training and apprenticeships can help.\n\nHere’s where I go back to being a typical policymaker by plugging my staff’s work: If anyone here wants more information, the Philadelphia Fed has recently published a guide to apprenticeships in our area to provide private sector organizations with information on how you can get involved. Copies are available to everyone, and, since Keith Rolland is responsible, you can corner him and ask him all the questions you want in person. It’s good for the workforce, and it’s good for business.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be in London and a special pleasure to be standing in the truly beautiful Palace of Westminster.\n\nPeople generally invite a Fed president to speak about the U.S. economy, and I certainly plan to oblige. So today, I’d like to start with an outlook and discussion of my view of the path of monetary policy. But I’d also like to address something that binds not just our two countries but nations across the globe: international trade.\n\nI’m standing in a building that is steeped in history and tradition, from Black Rod and the Queen’s Speech to the dragging of the Speaker in the House of Commons. So, I feel a need to honor that tradition by sharing one of our own. And while our history is obviously shorter in term than yours, this is nonetheless a time-honored Fed custom: the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nU.S. Outlook\n\nWith that, I’ll start off with a snapshot of the American economy.\n\nGrowth for 2017 so far is more or less what we expected. The first quarter was relatively weak, which has been the case for first quarters over the past several years. That’s what we’ve come to expect at this point, so it’s not cause for alarm. This year’s 1.2 percent Q1 growth was influenced by factors I believe are transient, like weather, seasonality, and low inventory investment. I expect second quarter growth to rebound and overall GDP growth for 2017 to average about 2.3 percent.\n\nI’m aware of the pitfalls of economic forecasting — I believe the old maxim is that economists are people who will know tomorrow why the things they predicted yesterday didn’t happen today. But I’ll tempt fate by saying that I predict growth of just above 2 percent for 2018 and 2019. That’s assuming that things unfold the way they have been. And if things do continue on their current path, that’s frankly the rate of growth we should consider normal in the U.S.\n\nInflation has been a hot topic of conversation recently. The latest PCE numbers are from April, which show a downtick in both headline and core inflation, to 1.7 and 1.5 percent year-on-year, respectively. That was the second report in a row that had PCE heading in the wrong direction. Coupled with the most recent CPI data for May, which makes for the third of those reports to trend downward, it’s prompted a lot of questions for Fed policymakers. Will soft inflation data derail our normalization plans?\n\nI make this point frequently, but policymakers are wont to be repetitive, so I’ll make it again. It’s a mistake to get caught up in a single decimal point, report, or even a quarter’s worth of data. The importance lies in underlying trends, and, in the case of inflation, I’ve seen the factors exerting downward pressure as temporary. That said, the Fed is data dependent, and, as information comes in, there’s the possibility that those transitory factors may be less transitory than we thought.\n\nFor the meantime, therefore, I’m sticking to my outlook that we’re on the right path, but I’m adjusting my view slightly on meeting our inflation goal from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018. This is the advanced economic practice of “hedging one’s bets.”\n\nAs for the labor market, I see very little slack left. The most recent data show an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, the lowest the U.S. has seen in 16 years. That’s either at or below the natural rate and reflects a steady tightening over the course of the expansion. I see that rate edging down even further over the course of the next couple of years before moving a few tenths of a percentage point back up again.\n\nJob creation remains strong, and you can see clearly in the JOLTS data that openings and quits continue to indicate a fairly tight market. I think we’ll see an average of about 190,000 jobs a month for this year, which should fall to about 100,000 jobs a month by the end of 2019. Many headlines and commentators have responded to any month of job creation below 200,000 with, in my opinion, overreaction; much of the narrative around May’s 138,000 number was anguished. But it was a good number for where we are right now. As we move forward on a downward glide path over the next couple of years, eventually reaching a pace of about 100,000 jobs a month, we should remember: That’s going to be more than adequate to keep pace with population growth.\n\nAn area I have been hoping to see more improvement in is wage growth, and we’re finally starting to see some upward pressure. I see wage growth of about 2.5 to 3 percent this year, which is very welcome.\n\nBased on the strength of the economy, therefore, I still support the continued gradual removal of accommodation.\n\nI still see another rate hike as appropriate for 2017, having already implemented two this year.\n\nAnd we’ve recently announced the plan to unwind our $4.5 trillion balance sheet. We debated a number of options but ultimately decided on a reduction of reinvestment in both Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. It will start off slowly, build gradual momentum, and begin sometime this year — though I don’t want to tie that to a date in the calendar or a rung on the inflation ladder. It will be predictable to the point of boredom; we will communicate our intentions clearly, with a good amount of lead time; and once the process commences, it will be essentially on autopilot.\n\nThe caveat, of course, is that this is dependent on things continuing to unfold as they have been. To adopt an adage from my host country this evening, policymakers agree with Macmillan on what we’re wary of: “Events, dear boy, events.”\n\nThose events can take many forms, and, in the years following the financial crisis and subsequent recession in most of the world, we were reminded that sometimes they come from outside our own borders. I’m aware that the U.S. in some cases is more resilient; we’re the ones who give the world the proverbial cold when we sneeze. But we’re not immune. All our economies have become more and more intertwined, and the discussion of national economics is now also a discussion of global economics.\n\nTrade Gains: The Classics\n\nThe fact is that all advanced economies rely on trade. It makes simple economic sense for nations to use their comparative advantages, focusing on goods that are relatively cheap for them to produce and importing those that are relatively expensive to make at home. International trade allows countries to focus on what they’re good at, rather than spending valuable time and resources attempting to produce every good they need.1 International trade also addresses cyclical ups and downs, letting countries borrow in the lean times and build nest eggs in the boom ones.\n\nMore importantly, many countries would fail to be completely self-sustaining, owing to the simple limitations of natural and other resources. But even a country like the United States, which covers enough diverse territory with multiple resources to source most of what we need, relies on trade, because our economy depends on selling to our partners.\n\nThen there is the overwhelming body of work arguing that trade fosters peace and cooperation. I don’t believe I’m allowed to deliver a speech in the United Kingdom without mentioning the great Adam Smith, so here’s my reference: From Adam Smith’s view of mutually beneficial trade relationships fostering harmony to Bastiat’s positing that trading nations will avoid war with one another, the idea that peace is wrought by intertwined economic fortunes is a well-established principle of economic thought.\n\nThe Production Chain Conundrum\n\nThat, however, is the philosophical, borne out by data as it may be. From the practical side, there is the reality that many supply chains have become as intertwined as global economies. Products whose provenance is a single country no longer make up the entirety of trade. A tractor, for instance, may be made out of raw materials shipped from Asia to South America for processing, then to North America to make the frame, then back to South America for finishing touches, then back to North America for sale, some domestically and some via the export market.\n\nWhile this is an extensive chain of custody for any one product, it’s generally done for efficiency’s sake, utilizing countries’ expertise and saving businesses money while delivering quality.2 It makes sense and benefits all parties involved.\n\nBut this kind of global production is particularly sensitive to trade protection because every time that tractor’s parts cross a border, they face a potential tariff.\n\nHere I will tread with extreme caution — I’m not in the business of dispensing advice to other policymakers, and I’m definitely not weighing in on trade policy for the U.S. or any other nation. From a purely economic perspective, however, our economies have become too integrated with one another to turn back. Trade on this level is unlikely to disappear — on the contrary, it’s likely to increase — and that means even modest tariffs, if they are applied several times over to the same production chain, would be enough to disrupt a host of industries.\n\nTrade’s Influence on Growth and Income\n\nThat would be a disservice to everyone, because trade is a net positive both on a national and individual level. Research shows that a 10 percent increase in trade is associated with a 5 percent increase in income per capita.3 Likewise, doubling a country’s trade share can lead to an increase in GDP of an estimated 25 percent over the span of a decade.\n\nHistory chronicles trade’s effects. Economic development from 1800 to 1980 saw a steady rise in global inequality precisely because only developed economies were open to trade. When previously closed economies subsequently opened up, the trend was reversed.4 China is just one — but perhaps the most discussed — example of how trade can rapidly reverse economic fates. Korea is another example, as are, increasingly, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nUltimately, international trade has helped mitigate global poverty: Although the world’s population grew by 1.6 billion between 1980 and 2000, the number of people living in extreme poverty actually declined by up to 200 million.5 While trade can’t take all the credit for that shift, it certainly played a role.6\n\nHarm over Help?\n\nIf trade’s benefits are so overwhelmingly positive, why has there been such animosity toward it? I think there are two reasons: First, there are common myths attached to trade and its effects. Second, there are, in fact, losers in the trade game, which is something we should take seriously.\n\nOne of the arguments against trade is the belief that low-wage countries unfairly compete against mature economies. Some believe this delivers the double blow of taking jobs away from developed countries while simultaneously allowing advanced economies to exploit their less developed counterparts.\n\nA more accurate depiction is that low wages go hand in hand with lower productivity, meaning less developed economies do not, on the whole, have an edge. Additionally, as trade in these goods shifts, it frees up resources in more developed economies, letting them concentrate on more specialized goods made by skilled workers, who, in turn, earn higher wages.\n\nAs for lower wage countries, the simple math is that, without trade, those wages would be even lower.\n\nThe Costs of Trade\n\nThat said, there are people who feel the downside of global trade more acutely than others.\n\nTrade, on the whole, is a benefit. It makes products cheaper, including necessities like food, and countries tend to reap the rewards on a macro level.\n\nBut the many who benefit don’t do so in a life-altering way; we aren’t moved by a price change of a few dollars or cents in our everyday purchases. In the case of the United States, the relatively abundant supply of skilled workers benefit, while the unskilled portion of the labor force can, in fact, lose out to competition from abroad.\n\nThe rewards are reaped in breadth, spread among the 320-plus million people who live in the U.S. Those who suffer, however, do so on a profound level. Entire industries and the populations that depend on them are affected. Those effects are big and are taken on by a small number of people, increasing their burden.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons jobs in certain sectors have disappeared. Automation, changes in market preferences, and other factors have contributed to industry shifts. So, while trade does have real effects for some workers, much of the debate is muddied by the multiple contributors.\n\nSo, what can we do to help the people who’ve been negatively affected?\n\nAgain, there isn’t much that can be done to stop the trade train. The natural state of the human condition is to search for not just subsistence but for substance, and opening the door to trade generally makes things better, faster, and more affordable.\n\nBut we have to do something to help those who are displaced or disadvantaged. This is something of a conundrum with a labor market with so little slack left. We’ve reached a point where the competition is among employers vying for candidates rather than applicants vying for jobs. While there’s some debate on the subject of the skills mismatch, research by my staff shows this is absolutely an issue. And while I know that the plural of “anecdote” isn’t “data,” it’s definitely something I’m hearing from the business community across my District. A businessman I know has doubled the bays for his trucking repair business to keep up with demand, but half of them are empty because he can’t find qualified mechanics. He’s paying salaries of over $100,000 a year, but he can’t fill the jobs. That’s because trucking repair doesn’t just involve basic maintenance anymore; it requires digital skills. It reflects what we’re consistently seeing: There are jobs but not enough people with the right training.\n\nI’m using examples from my District, but we’re seeing examples across the country. I should note that the Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks in Districts across the country, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. My District is the smallest, comprising about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware. In total, that’s a little less than half of the United Kingdom.7 So, small for the U.S., but not insignificant by any means. And it’s made up of multiple and diverse economies from postindustrial to rural, urban to suburban.\n\nOne solution to the skills gap is obviously training programs and more investment in practical education. My staff recently completed a guide to apprenticeships in our area to provide private sector organizations with information on how they can get involved. This is a good start, and the more research and data the better. But there also needs to be a cultural shift. At some point, vocational education took on a negative connotation, and that’s a problem. Education shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all. Not everyone wants or needs — or frankly should — take the traditional university route.\n\nMore research by my staff identified what they’re calling “opportunity occupations,” jobs that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a traditional four-year degree. If we can be more strategic about the way we train our rising and existing workforce, we can benefit both workers and employers.\n\nWe can’t guarantee that every industry will be immune to whatever creative destruction comes its way. But we can instill a culture that prizes training and is therefore better able to adapt to change.\n\nAgain, I’m not telling anyone how to legislate. My only job is to offer data and economic reality.\n\nThat reality is that trade is not a zero sum game; a win for one country is not a loss for another. Rather, it is a contribution to a global market that ebbs and flows in an overall benefit to everyone.\n\nAnd international trade is an overall positive. There is nothing in this world that is without risks, and no progress comes without paradigm shifts. But we have it in our power to take those shifts and turn them to our advantage by thinking of new — and reprising old — ways of adapting to change.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.

            "content": "Good afternoon and welcome; it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economic outlook, including my views on monetary policy, then talk a bit about a subject that’s crucial to economic success on a local, regional, and national level but that often gets treated as a separate subject: economic growth and mobility.\n\nBefore I do that, let me perform the sacred Fed ritual of delivering the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nI’ll start with the outlook, which, overall, is pretty good.\n\nFirst quarter GDP growth was quite weak. The most recent revision puts that number at 1.2 percent, which is better than the previous 0.7 percent estimate. This actually illustrates a point I want to make because I think it’s a mistake to give either number too much weight.\n\nWe’ve seen weak first quarter growth for several years now to the extent that it’s essentially become the new normal. This year’s culprits were weather, low inventory investment, and our old friend seasonality. These effects are likely transient, and they’ve proved to be so in the past. I project overall GDP growth of 2.3 percent for 2017, which is pretty much what we should consider normal for the medium term.\n\nTurning to inflation, things are still on track, despite a couple of months trending in the wrong direction. Both headline and core PCE ticked down in April, to 1.7 and 1.5 percent year-on-year, respectively, but I still think we’re doing fine. We spent a lot of the past few years waiting for inflation to rise to meet our 2 percent target. Now we’re on track, and two reports showing slight downward trends don’t derail my outlook.\n\nMuch like the disappointment over slow first quarter GDP growth, I think the concern over a couple of months of less-than-perfect inflation data is unwarranted.\n\nWe’re essentially at normal now, and it’s a mistake to get caught up in a single report, or month, or even quarter’s worth of data. It’s much more important to take a step back and look at underlying trends and what they mean for the medium term. In this case, my forecast remains that we should reach our inflation goal around the end of the year.\n\nOn the other side of our mandate, I see very little slack left in the labor market.\n\nIn May, unemployment reached its lowest rate in 16 years, reaching 4.3 percent. I see it moving down even further — dropping as low as 4.2 percent by the end of next year. Upward pressure on wages is finally starting to assert itself, and I estimate wage growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent this year. This is a very good sign; it’s one of the things that’s been missing as the recovery has unfolded.\n\nJob creation is still strong. We had 138,000 jobs in May, which is a good number. I see job creation eventually falling to about 100,000 a month by the end of 2019.\n\nJust as I think we need to put monthly fluctuations in inflation data in perspective, I think we need to put job growth in context. In the very near future, we’re not going to need to create jobs at the intense pace we’ve been experiencing over the past few years.\n\nThe 100,000-jobs-a-month rate is going to be more than sufficient to keep up with population growth. That’s more or less the rate we’ll need in a normal, healthy economy.\n\nBased on the strength of the economy, I still see three rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017.\n\nI also believe that we will begin unwinding the balance sheet sometime this year, although I’m not tying that to a date on the calendar or a data point on an inflation report. It will be slow, steady, incredibly boring, and essentially on autopilot.\n\nAnd, of course, all of this is predicated on the assumption that things continue to unfold as they have been.\n\nThe Costs of Poverty and Inequality\n\nI say “based on the strength of the economy,” and I do believe that we are more or less at full health. The small adjustments that need to be made here and there are not earth-moving numbers, they’re just needed to ensure that the foundation is strong.\n\nBut that, of course, is the macro view. And that doesn’t take into account the places across the country, and within the Third District, that haven’t recovered the way their neighbors have.\n\nYou’ll hear a presentation later today that delves deeper into the state’s economy, and, of course, I’m speaking to the Pennsylvania Economic Association, so I’m sure you’re fully aware that there are pockets of the state that haven’t made their way back yet. You’re aware that Philadelphia is the poorest of the top 10 cities in the U.S. You’re aware that some of the cities and towns right next door are struggling economically.\n\nOne of the things the Fed does that doesn’t get much attention is our Community Development work. It’s almost our best-kept secret, which is too bad, because it’s incredibly important. I’d therefore like to talk a bit today about why that is and what we’re doing at the Philadelphia Fed to work with communities of all economic profiles across the Third District.\n\nFrom my personal perspective, there is an ethical obligation to do what we can to help each other. But Congress didn’t charge us with determining moral imperatives, which, obviously, rely much less on data than a wonky policymaker would be comfortable with.\n\nSo, I’ll stick to the pragmatic argument, which is that inclusive growth is good for the overall economy, and conversely, that both poverty and inequality in income are detrimental to the economic well-being of the country.\n\nThe current poverty line in the United States is an annual income of $24,339 for a family of four. According to the most recently available data, the U.S. has over 43 million people living in poverty. That’s over 13 percent of the population.1 As for inequality, the United States ranks 43rd in the world by the Gini index.2 There is growing debate within the field of economics on the impact of inequality. But while some inequality is inevitable in any free-market society, I’m in the camp that says too much inequality, or too much breadth in inequality, ultimately costs us.\n\nChildhood poverty alone costs the U.S. close to $500 billion annually.3 And research shows the effects of inequality on GDP is significant as well. For instance, when additional income goes to the top quintile of earners, GDP actually falls by 0.08 percent. But when the same happens for the bottom quintile, GDPrisesby almost 0.4 percent.4\n\nThen there is the simple fact that this vast and diverse country is made up of micro- and macroeconomies that are intertwined and overlap and have ripple effects beyond city, county, or state lines. Our economic fortunes are tied to one another.\n\nSo, if the problems facing some of us ultimately translate into the problems that face all of us, what do we do about it?\n\nEGMP: The Economic Growth & Mobility Project\n\nFor our part, the Philadelphia Fed has launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project to look for practical applications for the abundance of research in the field. We have a lot of data and in-depth studies that can inform issues across the District and, hopefully, across the country as well.\n\nI’m a huge fan of research, as I’m sure everyone here is as well. It’s the fuel that keeps academics going. But there’s an added energy when our research has a practical application.\n\nThe work in the field of economic mobility has incredible potential, and we’re lucky enough to be sitting in the middle of a natural laboratory.\n\nI say it pretty frequently, but it bears repeating — while the Third District is the Fed’s smallest, it provides a unique perspective. It covers Pennsylvania from about Johnstown and east; southern New Jersey; and all of Delaware. Although it’s geographically very compact, the District encompasses urban centers, suburban expanse, post-industrial cities and towns, and rural areas.\n\nThat means it’s a microcosm of America. We know that the challenges that Philadelphia faces aren’t the same as the ones we find in Reading. The footprint of the Third District means we have the opportunity to find custom-fit solutions for both of those profiles and others as well.\n\nEGMP: Workforce Development\n\nOne of our primary areas of focus is skills training and workforce development. We’re starting to see a different set of issues emerge than we were contending with at the height of the recession, when unemployment peaked at 10 percent. Now we’ve got jobs going unfilled.\n\nThis isn’t just what I hear from my contacts in the community; it’s in the data. We’ve come to a point in the labor market where the competition is among the employers trying to fill slots rather than the applicants vying for them. But there’s a skills mismatch. There just aren’t enough people with the right training to do the jobs that are out there.\n\nI’ll give you an example: A contact of mine has a trucking repair business in Pennsylvania, and he’s doubled the number of bays because business is so good. But half of them are sitting empty because he can’t find qualified mechanics. He’s paying over $100,000 a year, but he just can’t find workers who are equipped to do the job. It’s no longer just mechanical; now that so much of truck repair is computerized, workers need digital skills as well.\n\nSo, what do we do? There is obviously a need for training programs and more investment in practical education. But there’s also a cultural shift that needs to happen. At some point along the way, we decided to burden vocational education with a negative connotation. We seem to have collectively decided that education should be one-size-fits-all. And I don’t understand that.\n\nNot everyone wants to take the road more traveled, and it’s not in everyone’s best interest to do so. There are good jobs out there that don’t insist on a traditional college plan.\n\nMy staff has done research on these in conjunction with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds. They’re calling them “opportunity occupations”: jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require a four-year degree. A lot of them are in health care, which is an industry with immense growth potential.\n\nIf we can be more strategic about the way we encourage and train our rising workforce, we can benefit both the workers and the employers.\n\nThere is one caveat that I should mention. Because, of course, there’s very little under the sun that is devoid of nuance or, frankly, potholes.\n\nIn follow-up research by my staff, they found that during the recession and slow recovery, the competition for jobs meant some employers began to upskill job requirements, even though it wasn’t strictly necessary. That is, for a job that had previously required an associate’s degree or technical training, they could now ask for a bachelor’s.\n\nThat has remained somewhat sticky as the labor market has tightened. But I believe that as time passes, we’ll start to see things come back into balance again. And I’d like to see that. Because the pathway to an economically secure middle-class life can and should be paved by different forms of education.\n\nAt the end of last year, I visited Roxborough High School in Philadelphia, which has an Academies program that allows students to pick a course of concentration while they study the regular curriculum.\n\nIt’s a pretty brilliant model because it sets them up to enter the workforce directly from high school if they want to, which means they can earn a good salary if they want to take a couple of years on the job before returning to school, work part-time while continuing their education, or just start their climb up the professional ladder immediately.\n\nI should mention that all of the students I talked to thought the practical aspect of their learning was a huge positive.\n\nSome of them get up at 5:00 a.m. and take three buses just to get to school because they see a place in this program as a stepping stone to a bright future. After high school, some of them may go the route of the traditional four-year degree, and some will do something different. One of the young women I spoke with wants to be an anesthesiologist, for instance, while another is thinking about a social media start-up.\n\nBut regardless of which track they choose, there’s no limit to their choices in life; none of them see their vocational training as anything but a competitive edge.\n\nThey’re right; after talking with them, I’m pretty sure at least a couple of them are going to be running the country soon enough.\n\nI really want their attitudes toward creative paths to education and training to be the prevailing ones: We all have our own ways of getting to the endpoint, and for the United States to have a labor market that is truly running on all cylinders, we need a workforce that is as innovative and creative as the sectors they represent.\n\nEGMP: Transportation\n\nOf course, no difficult problem or economic issue has one root cause; if it did, our job in Community Development would be much easier.\n\nIt’s clear that even if we arm people with the skills and training to get good jobs, it might not be enough. Because at the end of the day, not everyone can get to the good jobs.\n\nTransportation isn’t generally seen as an exciting topic, which is fine, because neither is monetary policy. But it’s an important one nonetheless. Some of the most intractable issues we face with social mobility are caught up in these kinds of basic infrastructure matters.\n\nThe ways we’ve migrated in this country, socially and economically, have changed over the decades and centuries. Where we once found the hubs of commerce, we also found residential areas.\n\nThen we began the immense wave of suburbanization that fundamentally changed the way we live and work and travel between the two.\n\nNow, we’re seeing the reversal of the trend that characterized the latter half of the 20th century and find people returning to city centers.\n\nWe have a transportation system, however, that was largely developed during the retreat from urban living and therefore built to bring people from the satellites into the center. But that’s not necessarily the best structure now.\n\nOur Community Development team has been working with the city of Scranton on exactly this issue. The Economic Growth & Mobility Project I mentioned is going to focus on action labs, which we’ll convene to find practical means to solving challenges identified by the communities we partner with. For instance, we’ve been working with stakeholders from across Scranton for the past several months to better understand their challenges in getting low-income residents connected to work and helping them identify solutions.\n\nOne of the biggest growth areas in the region is distribution centers, and there are a lot of jobs attached to them. But our transportation system is set up to bring people to the city center, not out to the areas where those distribution jobs are. The basic arithmetic is that, if you can’t get to a job, it doesn’t matter how many there are. And if you can’t fill the jobs, your business can’t expand.\n\nWe’re working with a local foundation to help bring people together to address Scranton’s specific needs. Then, hopefully, we can export that model and the lessons we learned to similar cities around the country.\n\nEGMP: Future Work\n\nThere’s a lot more in the pipeline and a world of work open to us. We have opportunities to partner with businesses, civic groups, not-for-profits, and philanthropies across the District and the country to find innovative solutions to problems in diverse areas.\n\nThe fact is that economic health is the sum of multiple parts, and investments in one area have huge implications for others. A better educated population, for instance, means a more skilled workforce pumping more money into the economy. More people employed in good jobs means lower crime and safer neighborhoods. Safer neighborhoods mean higher property values.\n\nThe work we do in Community Development to strengthen local economies will have effects that resonate beyond those areas, from Scranton to Reading to Wilmington and beyond.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]See Poverty Thresholds, U.S. Census Bureau, www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html; see Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015, U.S. Census Bureau, www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html.\n\n[2]See the World Factbook, Central Intelligence Agency, North America: United States, www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html.\n\n[3]Harry J.

            "content": "Good evening; it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nTonight, I’d like to give you an overview of my outlook for the economy going forward, including my preferences for the path of monetary policy. Which, I assume, is what you’re expecting from me.\n\nI also assume you expect the standard disclaimer, which I’ll get out of the way immediately: The views I express here this evening are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet’s jump right in.\n\nStarting off, the advance estimate of first quarter GDP was that it grew only 0.7 percent. That’s prompted a lot of concern, which I think is an overreaction. It’s not a good idea to get caught up in a single data point, or report, or even a quarter’s numbers. It’s more important to look at underlying trends and what they say about the economy’s trajectory in the medium term.\n\nA slow first quarter isn’t something to ignore entirely, but weak first quarters have been a feature of the economy for the past several years. It’s essentially the norm now. Seasonality, weather, and low inventory investment were the main culprits this time, and those are likely transitory — they’ve been issues in the past, and they’ve retreated as the year wore on. So, it’s not enough to make me think that we’re headed in the wrong direction. It is enough to make me revise my growth projection down by 0.1 percentage point for the year, but that’s about the extent of it. Overall, that means I see growth of about 2.3 percent for 2017.\n\nTurning to the inflation side of our mandate, we’re still on track. While numbers have retreated slightly, again, I’m looking at the trend. A month or two in the wrong direction isn’t enough to make me lose faith.\n\nOn employment, things are looking very good. The unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest point in a decade, quits are up, and we’re starting to see upward pressure on wages. I estimate 2.5 to 3 percent wage growth this year, which is good. It’s what has been missing from this recovery.\n\nI expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down, dropping as low as 4.2 percent around the end of next year. As for job creation, I estimate a rate of about 200,000 a month on average for 2017, falling to about 100,000 a month by the end of 2019.\n\nHere’s another point I want to make about headlines making more waves than they should. In the relatively near future, we’re not going to need the same pace of job creation as we did over the past several years. We had a lot of ground to make up for then, but we won’t need the same rate going forward. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 a month is what many believe is appropriate to keep up with population growth.1\n\nUltimately, we’re looking at a labor market with very little slack left.\n\nIn the near term, that means we should start to see movement on wage growth. In the medium term, it means we’re going to be seeing a more moderate pace of job creation. In the longer term … it means a serious talk about the labor market.\n\nLabor Force Participation\n\nThe labor force participation rate is still low. In the past couple of years, it’s moved roughly sideways, which was an upward surprise to some, given demographic motivators. And it was a downward surprise to others who speculated that more people would start to come back off the sidelines as the recovery continued.\n\nI’m in the camp that says we’re still projected to stay at a lower rate than previous years and that we won’t see a reversal in that trend going forward. Research by my staff is clear that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.2\n\nThe most influential impact is coming from the first wave of baby boomers starting to retire. There’s also the simple fact that we’re living longer, so there are just more people in the mix. Which I think is something to be celebrated, personally.\n\nThere are other contributing factors: students not working while they’re in school, for instance. A shift in views on work–life balance that has more people making the tradeoff of a single-income household. And then there’s the one that’s received the most attention: the declining participation of the prime age male cohort. There are a lot of theories and research on where they’ve gone. Alan Krueger’s much-talked-about recent paper found that close to half of the prime age men not in the labor force may have a serious health condition that keeps them from working.3\n\nThat said, there is some nuance to the prime age male conundrum. While the overall participation rate is low and there’s no evidence that it will surge upward, there is some room for prime age men’s participation to edge up a bit. The largest contributor to this group’s nonparticipation in recent years has been disability. Which theoretically should be long-lasting or permanent. But my staff’s research shows that at least some of that can be cyclical.\n\nThat, of course, will contribute marginally to the overall rate, although it won’t give us the boost we need to keep up with growth.\n\nIf we look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, we can already see some effects of low participation. After bottoming out in mid-2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the subsequent six years. That’s very slow for a recovery, and it’s even slow by historical averages. Growth averaged 3.5 percent in the second half of the 20th century — 1.7 percent of that came from the expansion of the American workforce. By contrast, the labor force has only grown by 0.5 percent over the recovery, less than half the historical average.\n\nThen there are the demographic shifts: The changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.4 Even though millennials outnumber us, they aren’t all fully in the workforce, and even the oldest ones aren’t quite in their prime earning years.\n\nWith all those people in retirement and with people living longer, there are more economic pressures to contend with. And the consequence of a declining participation rate means that output per capita will grow more slowly.\n\nWe therefore have a workforce that is less productive than it used to be with the pressure of caring for a retiring segment of the population that is bigger than it’s ever been before. There will be a strain on Medicare and Social Security, leaving fewer resources for the country to spend on other areas — for instance, maintaining our competitive global edge.\n\nMy remarks today will be heavy with caveats. The first being that as a Fed president, I’m not in the business of telling other people how to conduct their policy. So, the points I make today are from the perspective of someone who is affected — as a policymaker and a citizen — by the decisions made in legislative halls but not as someone who’s in a position to make those changes himself.\n\nMonetary policy is fairly limited in its scope. The Fed’s job is to create the conditions for a strong and healthy economy. Changing the trajectory of U.S. growth takes legislative action.\n\nThe fact is that this is basically it. This is the labor force we have. And if we expect our economy to expand, we need people to do the jobs we have now and the ones that are coming in the future.\n\nEmployers are struggling to fill the positions they have open. Even with workforce development and training programs, which are necessary, we just don’t have the people. We need to close the gap in the workforce. And given long-term demographic trends, that means we need to turn to outside sources.\n\nAgain, I want to be clear: I’m not suggesting immigration policy or telling anyone how to go about legislating. But from a purely economic standpoint, immigration, particularly high-skilled immigration, is a source of immense potential for economic growth. Fundamentally, we need more people; that’s how we get more growth.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBut let me talk about the policy that is within my purview.\n\nFirst and foremost, based on the strong economic outlook, I continue to see three rate hikes for 2017 as appropriate. That, as ever, is assuming that things unfold in line with my projections.\n\nThen there’s the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Or, should I say, the $4.5 trillion gorilla in the room: the balance sheet.\n\nI know everyone here has the specifics down, but for the benefit of anyone who might not, and for posterity’s sake, a very quick primer on where we are and how we got here.\n\nIn normal times, the Fed holds mostly short-term treasuries. In extraordinary times, like in the recession and its aftermath, we’ve turned to unconventional policies, including QE. Which meant we were buying assets on a much larger scale and venturing into longer-term treasuries along with mortgage-backed securities. That swelled the balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, which is significantly larger than the $2 trillion it was when we started extraordinary monetary policy and the roughly $900 billion it was before the crisis.\n\nSince we stopped the purchases, in late 2014, we’ve simply reinvested the proceedings as they’ve come to maturity to keep the balance sheet constant. The discussion now is how and when to begin unwinding those assets, and, to some extent, why.\n\nThe why part is easy: As the economy continues its march toward normal, we’ll need to start removing accommodation. That’s a point I want to emphasize. Monetary policy has been very accommodative for almost nine years. As we start the process of normalization, it’s important to remember that tightening policy isn’t the same thing as tight policy. We’re talking about easing our foot off the proverbial gas — very slowly, I might add — we’re not talking about applying the brakes.\n\nWe will still be holding a lot of assets, we’ll still have rates that are historically very low, and the overall stance of monetary policy will still be very supportive of growth.\n\nThis is about recognizing that we’re headed toward an economy at full health and that means we start hovering over the punch bowl again, just in case we need to take it away. We don’t have our hands on it yet; we’re just edging toward it in case the economy starts to look like it’s overheating.\n\nAnother factor of the “why” is that we want our unconventional tools to be at their most effective. As productivity has dropped, it’s taken the neutral funds rate with it, which means the zero lower bound is closer and we have less room for maneuver. That constricts the efficacy of using the fed funds rate. And if something were to happen, if another crisis were to occur, further asset purchases may prove less effective, or perhaps even more difficult to execute, with a large balance sheet still in place.\n\nAs for the “when” part, I’m going to disappoint the journalists in the room by saying that the timing isn’t tied to a specific date or number. It’s the same discussion we had about when to start raising rates: We don’t want to get too far behind the curve on inflation and get forced into an abrupt or steep correction course that could cause market disruption. But we also don’t want to commit to a course of action if the data were to start moving in the wrong direction. I do think we’ll start sometime this year, but I’m not tying it to any numerical determinant, whether that’s a decimal point on inflation or a day in the calendar.\n\nThe “how” is predictable, slow, and as boring as possible. There are different options under discussion, but we’re looking for a normalization process that is gradual and essentially on autopilot. If something happens, of course we’ll intervene, but we fundamentally want to push the start button and leave it to churn slowly away. We’ll still discuss the balance sheet in meetings, but if things are good, we’ll leave it to gradually unwind in the background.\n\nAnd we’ll let you know. I can say with absolute certainty that markets will get a heads up with a good amount of time.\n\nI can also definitively say that it will be boring. It will be the policy equivalent of watching paint dry. Fed presidents had a brief encounter with people finding us interesting over the past few years. Now we’re headed back to the natural state of things, where people try to avoid getting stuck next to us at dinner parties.\n\nThe funds rate will be our primary monetary policy tool, and we’ll keep the unconventional ones in the arsenal in case we need to use them again, which I hope we won’t.\n\nSo, that’s it. I know I’ve probably disappointed some of you by not giving dates and times and the secrets of the chamber … although I’m sure you’re going to ask me in Q&A anyway. And with that, I’ll turn it over to you to do exactly that.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, Scott A.

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you. And congratulations! This is a wonderful day. You’ve accomplished so much, and your friends and families are so proud of you … give yourselves a round of applause.\n\nThat’s an old trick to make it look like you were giving me standing ovations from the beginning …\n\nSome of you are probably wondering why a Fed president is giving the commencement address to graduates in the field of health. The answer is that I can’t charge a speaker’s fee, so I’m cheap.\n\nI’m just kidding … or at least I think I am. President Klasko?\n\nBut in all seriousness, there is some method to the madness. For one, I can tell you that you’ve made an economically sound career choice. And you know it’s true because I’ve just established that they can’t pay me to say it. Also, the data back me up — health care is one of the fastest growing sectors out there, and it’s set to keep expanding for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo graduates, you have the security of entering a job market full of opportunities. Which means, parents, you have the security of knowing they won’t be moving back in with you.\n\nThere’s also an inextricable link between physical and economic well-being. In the research canon on creating economically strong communities, health is a critical factor. In fact, there’s a ton of research out there on how important health is to every aspect of life. It affects children’s prospects in education and achievement. It affects people’s ability to work and succeed in their careers. It affects entire neighborhoods’ economic potential. And it affects people’s ability to hope.\n\nYou’re graduating at a time when medicine is more advanced than ever before. But perhaps the most necessary and healing tool you possess predates Hippocrates. It’s the hope you give to people who are suffering. That’s both the power to heal and the ability to act as a touchstone.\n\nThere’s an energy that attaches itself to graduation season. Across the country, you and your peers are headed into a world of endless possibilities.\n\nIt’s an air of hope. Because hope, fundamentally, is the ability to see a bright future.\n\nIt can be easy to forget, on days like today, that there are pockets dotting the American landscape where hope is in short supply. You’re going to see it more than other people because you’re going to see the effects close up.\n\nYou’ll see it in the opioid epidemic. You’ll see it in what recent research calls “deaths of despair.” You’ll see it in communities that have struggled through years of neglect.\n\nThe effects are devastating, and they have a ripple effect across the entire health-care spectrum. Some of you will encounter it directly, some indirectly, but it’s likely it will touch you all professionally in some capacity.\n\nWhat strikes me is that the areas of the country that are struck low by the intersection of poor health and dim economic prospects, the areas that are most affected by these crises, are caught in a spiral of hopelessness. Your connections with people, the part you’ll play in giving them hope, can be life changing. In the words of Desmond Tutu: “Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness.”\n\nThat’s something to remember when you start your careers because the impact of working in health resonates far beyond treating a single malady. And it’s something to remember when you reach the midpoint, when you’re burned out from being down in the trenches, or when you start to question why you went into this field in the first place. Because believe me, there will be that time. Everyone has it.\n\nSo, when it happens, remember that you’re helping to heal people. You’re giving them back their hope, and that’s crucially important. And that goes for everyone here, whether it’s hands-on work with patients, research, or being part of managing the overall system.\n\nFrankly, anyone who helps to tame the bureaucracy of health care deserves a congressional medal of honor …\n\nSo today, in the commencement address tradition of dispensing advice, I’m not going to tell you to live every day like it’s your last. I’m not going to tell you to dream the impossible dream. I’m not going to tell you to change the world via disruption, although certainly feel free to do all those things. Instead, I’ll just tell you about the immense power of human interaction and that you can change the world one quiet, empathetic, kind moment at a time.\n\nKeep that with you. You bring hope. You are hope. Never forget that.\n\nAnd never forget that wherever we wind up, none of us got there alone. Whether it’s friends, families, partners, or even just those who let you borrow their notes when you overslept, someone helped you get here today.\n\nSo, I want to take a moment to applaud them, the people in the audience who helped today’s graduates get here, the people who aren’t here but made all the difference, the people who sat beside you in class, and the ones who stood up in front and taught. The ones who gave you hope! They all have a piece of the success and joy of this day.\n\nLet’s give them a round of applause.\n\nI’m a former university president, so I know the rundown of the commencement address pretty well by now, and I think I’ve more or less reached the end.\n\nRequisite joke about students moving back in with their parents? Check.\n\nAdvice from the old guy who’s been around a lot longer than the fresh young faces in the audience? Check.\n\nSelf-deprecating joke about being old? Check.\n\nThat means I’m up to the part where I leave you with a last thought.\n\nI’ve already done the part where I quote someone famous and far wiser than I am, but I’ll do it again and turn to someone who inspired me both personally and professionally: John Gardner, who was a great scholar and, among other things, initiated the White House fellows program that helped start me on my way. He said, “You find that the world loves talent but pays off on character.”\n\nYou’re about to enter a world that’s hard work but eminently worth it. The impact you’ll have on hundreds, even thousands, of people throughout your careers will be immense. You will touch people’s lives, you’ll make an incredible difference, and you’ll have the power to heal body, mind, and soul. You will change the world, one person at a time.\n\nThank you. And congratulations!\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nWhile I’m tempted to launch into the subject of the day immediately, Fed presidents are all but required to give an economic update when we speak. So, with your indulgence, I’ll start with a brief overview and outlook for the U.S. economy, and then speak a little about the importance of infrastructure to economic health.\n\nAnother requirement of Fed presidents is that we all give the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWith that out of the way, time for the economic rundown.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe advance estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter is 0.7 percent, which pales in comparison to the previous quarter’s 2.1 percent. But weak first quarters have been constant enough in the past several years to make them effectively the norm. This year’s slowdown was due — as in years past — to a combination of residual seasonality, weather effects, and modest inventory investment. These drags are likely temporary, and I expect a rebound in the second quarter.\n\nOverall, I see growth for 2017 at about 2.3 percent. That’s a very slight downward revision of my previous estimate — only 0.1 percentage point, which reflects that slow first quarter growth.\n\nOn the inflation side of our mandate, things are looking good. Inflation has been persistently low over the past several years, but it’s on track to stabilize at our 2 percent goal by the end of this year.\n\nOn the other side, we’re looking at the lowest unemployment rate in a decade. We created 211,000 jobs in April, and unemployment is at or below its natural rate at 4.4 percent. Quits are up, and labor force participation is higher than a year ago, despite demographic trends that are pulling in the other direction. All in all, we’re looking at a labor market more or less at full health, with very little slack.\n\nI see the unemployment rate falling as low as 4.2 percent at the end of next year and average job growth of about 200,000 a month for 2017. That pace should ease down to about 100,000 jobs a month by the end of 2019.\n\nThis isn’t a bad thing. In a well-functioning labor market, we don’t need the kind of job growth we’ve seen over the past couple of years. In fact, to sustain a healthy economy, estimates of the ideal number range from about 70,000 to 100,000 a month to keep up with population growth.1\n\nSo overall, things are looking good. We’re essentially at normal now, and based on the strength of the economy, I continue to see two more rate hikes as appropriate this year.\n\nEconomic Growth and Mobility\n\nOf course, that’s the macro view of the American economy. I’m not blind to the areas that haven’t made the same comebacks as their neighbors. I know there are people across our District who feel left behind. One of the benefits to the regional Fed System is that Fed presidents get an on-the-ground view of their local economies. Another is that we have programs to help those communities. We don’t invest money or give grants because that’s not what we’re tasked to do, but we do have education and outreach programs; we get the right people in a room together; and we conduct research — something we are, in my totally unbiased opinion, exceptionally good at.\n\nResearch matters. I know we sometimes seem like we’re all just fusty old academics, sitting around pondering the minutiae of data and maybe even missing the forest for the trees. But the work we do — everyone here — forms the basis of real, demonstrable change. It has the potential to move people and families and towns and cities along the path from poverty to prosperity, and that’s powerful. It also allows us to sit around being fusty academics, poring over the minutiae of data, but that’s beside the point.\n\nWe recently launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project at the Philadelphia Fed that will take that work to its natural next step. We’re establishing research and action labs that will bring together experts and stakeholders to find ways to attack persistent problems at their roots. We’re looking at everything from workforce development — like apprenticeships and skills training — to work on the subject we’re here for today, urban infrastructure, including affordable housing and equitable transit.\n\nWhich is my awkward way of both plugging the excellent work by my Community Development team and pivoting to a new topic: infrastructure, the ebb and flow of urban patterns, and building inclusive economic growth.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nAs a Fed president, one of my aims is better economic prospects for the people in the Third District and around the country. One of the ways to accomplish that, of course, is urban revitalization — everything we’re talking about today: housing, transportation, competitiveness.\n\nInfrastructure is crucial. Humanity is naturally pulled toward what sustains us, be that practical or amenable. Real infrastructure is essential to modern living, whether that’s transportation or housing. So is soft infrastructure that promotes a better quality of life, from entertainment to quality and choice in education.\n\nAnd all of those are necessary for economic well-being, which I view as the sum of many parts, some of which sound tangential at best to a lot of people. Not anyone here, I’m sure, but to many. Affordable housing, strong education, transportation, and even physical health are all fundamental components of a thriving economy.\n\nIf people can’t afford to live near jobs — or if there’s no transportation to get them there — unemployment becomes a problem. If businesses can’t fill positions, they can’t expand.\n\nLikewise, the quality of life and ease of access in cities makes them competitive. High-value employees who can go anywhere are guided not just by salary but by amenities. That’s part of what compels businesses to establish a presence in one location over another. But if you can’t, for instance, fly internationally with ease, the city starts to look less desirable to a company that does business across the globe.\n\nSo yes, infrastructure of all kinds plays a central role in any city, region, state, or country’s success.\n\nInfrastructure and the Movement of People\n\nInfrastructure, both real and soft, has also played a role in where we live since we first built cities and towns across the colonies. Philadelphia itself is a perfect example.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, when we were a major trading center, not to mention the New World’s financial capital,2 everything was located by the river. On the commercial side, obviously anything related to shipping was drawn to the banks of the Delaware. But so were businesses that relied on trade, from tanneries to carriage shops to breweries.3 With that kind of concentration, it made sense for financial services to set up shop nearby.4\n\nTransportation options were limited, so most people lived within a few blocks of the river. Sure, the wealthy had country estates, but in the city, even they lived in the center of the action. Ultimately, people of all statuses lived in the central port area because of the concentration of industry and the high cost — and limited means — of travel.\n\nIn the 19th century, things started to change. New York usurped our role as the country’s financial capital, and manufacturing became Philadelphia’s economic engine. Factories were built farther west, toward Broad Street and Manayunk. Newer, faster modes of transportation were developed, and people started to live farther away from work, in the more comfortable — and quieter — suburbs.\n\nIn the 20th century, of course, the same kinds of forces affected migration. Transportation evolved even further, became even cheaper, and got people farther in less time. People owned cars, and we invested in the Interstate Highway System; research shows that highways caused a full 25 percent decline in central city living across the U.S. from 1950 to 1990.5 The suburbs offered more space and amenities at the same time that diminishing public financing and city services made urban Philadelphia less inviting.6 Manufacturing jobs also started to move out of the city.\n\nNow, of course, we’re witnessing the reversal of the mid-20th century suburbanization trend. This time, it’s partly motivated by the preference of higher-income households for conveniences like restaurants and theaters.7 Amenities have improved, and crime has gone down. As any Philadelphian can tell you, the city looks a lot different now than even 10 years ago, much less 20 or 30.\n\nSo, what does all this mean?\n\nFor one, it means that infrastructure plays a central role in where and how we choose to live.\n\nMore importantly, it means we have to think not just about how to equip our cities to handle the demands of a changing population but how to essentially reengineer the infrastructure that supported the needs of a different time. How, for instance, do we modernize commuter systems to serve changing commuting patterns?\n\nAnd finally, it means that we have to look more broadly at how regions — not just cities and states — work together to make systems more effective.\n\nBuilding an Inclusive Economy\n\nThe Third District is the smallest in the Fed System. We cover about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, starting around Johnstown and going east; Delaware; and southern New Jersey. But it’s really a microcosm of America: We have urban centers, suburban expanse, postindustrial towns, and rural areas.\n\nWhich means I can see the effect and influence of infrastructure on pretty much every economic profile.\n\nThere are three points I think are important when we talk about economic revitalization. First, that it should be inclusive. Second, that it can’t be one-size-fits-all. Third, that our neighbors’ fates are tied to our own.\n\nTaking those in turn:\n\nFirst, while economic strength and sustainability are important, we need to ensure they’re inclusive. That means balancing the risks of growth, particularly the displacement of a city’s long-term residents when good economic fortune sweeps in.\n\nWe’ve been watching and talking about gentrification for a long time. We know the patterns, and we know a lot about what drives movement into one neighborhood or another. With so many examples of booming cities across the country, cities should be able to plan ahead, whether that’s ensuring mixed-income housing or transit-oriented development.\n\nSecond, we have to acknowledge that the needs of Allentown aren’t the same as the needs of Philadelphia. My Community Development team is working with the city of Scranton on equitable transit, and we’ll have a summit in October to share some of the findings that can be adopted by other small cities around the country. Infrastructure — real and soft — is an issue for big cities, but it’s also important to smaller cities and towns, although they’re obviously addressing different concerns.\n\nFinally, as the president of a District that encompasses parts of three states, we have got to start seeing beyond traditional borders. I-95 doesn’t stop at the Philadelphia city limits. We’re a region as well as individual states and cities; working together on infrastructure projects is in everyone’s interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nI realize that I’ve made these proclamations as though fixes are easily found. As ever, just because we have the data or the experience doesn’t mean we have the solutions. If solving problems of economic expansion and sustainability were easy; if infrastructure came in an IKEA-like flat-pack, ready to be assembled; or if working across bureaucratic lines were simple, we’d have done it already. And a lot of economists would be out of jobs.\n\nIt takes work, I understand that. And much of that work has to be done outside the scope of my own professional reach.\n\nWhat we can do, however, is contribute to the body of research and offer ideas. That’s what we’re hoping to accomplish at the Philadelphia Fed, and that’s what conferences like this, and research like you’re undertaking, can help deliver as well.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, Scott A.

            "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back on Penn’s campus and an even bigger pleasure to return to my postgraduate days at the Engineering School.\n\nSo, why am I here? What’s a Fed president doing talking to a bunch of engineers? I suppose it’s all in the title of this lecture series: Technology, Business, and Government. There is so much overlap in that it makes sense to look at the ways they’re intertwined. It’s like a three-legged stool of modern commerce that you’ll all undoubtedly encounter in whatever profession you pursue. I started out as an engineer, so I suppose I’m living proof of that.\n\nI’ve actually found that some theoretical insights from systems engineering are easily applicable to commerce. So, the principles I learned right here come in handy, from complex adaptive systems to robust control to the Lucas critique. Although while engineers focus on the comfort of 95 percent accuracy, I’ve noticed that economics earns the term “the dismal science.” Central bankers focus on that errant 5 percent and seem to always be looking for black swans.\n\nSince I’ve mentioned my colleagues, now’s a good time to deliver the standard Fed disclaimer that I’m speaking for myself today and my views do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nSo, today I’d like to briefly outline what it is I do, give a quick economic update and outlook, and then talk about an area of increasing discussion these days: fintech. This is something that touches all three legs of the stool — technology, business, and government — and is an area some of you might find yourselves working in or alongside.\n\nFederal Reserve Overview\n\nBefore I start, just a very brief overview of the Federal Reserve System for the uninitiated. The Fed is set up in a uniquely American way: It’s a decentralized central bank. We have 12 regional Banks around the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. We vote on policy roughly every six weeks, which now mostly consists of decisions on whether or not to raise interest rates.\n\nWe make monetary policy, which shouldn’t be confused with fiscal or other policy. We focus on a dual mandate given to us by Congress, which is maximum employment and price stability. We don’t make decisions about things like debts and deficits, spending, and entitlements.\n\nIn general, you don’t hear too much about us unless we’ve done something, so you probably know that we raised rates at this last FOMC meeting. It was only the third time we’ve done that since we lowered them to near zero more than eight years ago, so it attracted some attention.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nFrom my perspective, it made sense given the data we’ve seen.\n\nThe labor market has shown steady improvement, and the 4.7 percent unemployment rate is at, or near, what I consider to be the natural rate of unemployment. We created 235,000 jobs in February, and we’re averaging about 200,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months.\n\nWage growth has ticked up, which is something I’ve been looking for. Average hourly earnings increased 2.8 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nJob openings remain high, layoffs remain at almost historical lows, and more people are quitting their jobs. This is one of those quirky measures we focus on. It’s a good indication of how people view the economy: They’re more likely to quit when they have confidence they can find a new job quickly.\n\nOn the inflation side of things, the momentum continues to be in the right direction. Inflation has been persistently below our target rate of 2 percent, but it’s been moving slowly but surely upward. We’re on the right track to reach our goal by the end of this year or the beginning of next, in my estimation. Recently, GDP (gross domestic product) growth has been driven largely by consumption, and I continue to forecast just above 2 percent growth for the year.\n\nI’m on record as saying that I view three rate hikes as appropriate in 2017, assuming things stay on track, and I still think that’s the right call. I continue to believe they should be gradual, both in pace and increments. I don’t want to get behind the curve, but I don’t think we need to rush, either. I consider every meeting to be live and that gives us plenty of opportunity over the course of the rest of the year.\n\nWe say all the time that our decisions are data dependent. So, I’ll be looking at the information as it comes in, but right now that’s the trajectory I see for policy.\n\nFintech: The Technology Leg\n\nSo, what does all this have to do with fintech? The obvious answer is that we deal with the banking system. The other is that we deal with money. And a big area of interest for a lot of people is digital currency. What impact might digital currency have? And how do I, as a monetary policymaker, view it in the context of my responsibilities? Before I get into that, I want to take a step back and first consider what, exactly, currency is and how — or rather, why — it works.\n\nThe underpinning of currency, like the financial system itself, is trust. A fiat currency like that in the United States, which is issued by a central bank in a secure and stable economy, works because we trust it. A dollar is a dollar. We all agree that it is and there’s not much that can undermine that faith. We experience inflation, sure, but not often in dramatic or abrupt ways.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the things you’ll see with digital currency is how wildly the value swings. The question is will there ever be a digital currency that is stable enough to become as widely used as a government one.\n\nResearch by my staff indicates that privately issued currencies can lead to unstable money supply and depreciation of the currency. Why? Because there’s no fundamental guarantee of its value in the same way that there is with currency issued by the central bank of a credible and stable government.1 So, unless a government issues it, the answer is likely that no, digital currencies won’t drive out our own any time soon. And while some governments are exploring the possibility of producing their own digital currencies, several hurdles remain, as my colleague, Governor Powell, outlined recently. Those include technical challenges, the unprecedented risk of cyberattacks, potential for criminal activity like money laundering, and threats to privacy.2\n\nThen there’s blockchain. Blockchain has tremendous potential and banks can use it to further manage risk. From my perspective, however, its real value is in authentication, not on distributing a virtual currency. And the implications of having a distributed ledger that offers virtually failsafe data storage are huge on the risk management side for any business.\n\nSo, there’s definitely some very interesting and potentially game-changing innovation coming out of fintech. But fintech overall is actually just natural market evolution and the assumptions about disruption — or indeed, creative destruction — are, with apologies to Schumpeter, probably out of proportion.\n\nPart of the reason things can look like a revolution instead of an evolution is that we’re viewing them in isolation. If you look along the broad history of an industry, you put things into context. You see the way banking evolved its products and appendages just like the first single-cell organisms evolved fins and gills and eventually feet and legs. Securitization, credit scoring, prepaid cards — which my team had already done about 20 studies on before anyone was paying much attention to them — don’t look revolutionary on the scale of fintech. But neither does the Commodore 64 when you stand it next to a MacBook Air. Yet we’d never overlook the effect of widely available in-home computers.\n\nSo, while much of this is exciting and the technology is very, very cool, I always warn against overstating its overall effect. This is, by and large, the same kind of evolution the banking system has seen for the past 40 years; it’s just a different delivery system.\n\nMy favorite analogy is peer-to-peer lending. When I was growing up in New Jersey, we had the same thing. Only in our case, Frankie asked Jimmy at the local bar to loan him a 20. The big difference was Jimmy knew where Frankie lived, so there was a lower rate of default. But overall, we’re talking about the same concept; we’ve just applied new technology to it.\n\nIn fact, what underpins the Frankie and Jimmy scenario, and banking and lending in general, is the fundamental principle of trust. In the grand scheme of things, as innovations enter and leave markets, the ones that survive — in any good business, but especially banking — are the ones that engender trust.\n\nWe trust that the cash we take out of an ATM is U.S. currency that has an agreed-upon value. We trust that when we want to access our bank accounts, the funds will be available. We trust that when we access credit that the terms and conditions we agree to will be followed by both parties.\n\nFintech may be a major player, but people have to be able to put their trust in it, and it has to prove its value to markets and the consumer.\n\nWe’re hosting a conference in September that’s going to focus on exactly that subject: What’s the end result in the efficient functioning of markets and in benefits to the consumer? What’s the benefit in consumer surplus that any of these innovations creates?\n\nMore research from my Bank indicates in its initial findings that for the same risk of default, consumers pay smaller spreads on loans from fintech companies than from traditional lenders. That’s something that can add value to a lot of people.3 The question of trust and value, of course, is a basic business principle.\n\nFintech: The Business Leg\n\nWhich leads me to the next leg of the stool: What do these developments mean for business? If fintech is wildly successful, if we all abandon tellers and ATMs, are banks going away?\n\nPolicymakers don’t like to make predictions, because the future has a funny way of defying expectations. But in this instance, I’ll go out on a limb and say no. Banks aren’t going anywhere.\n\nIt’s true that out of every innovation, a little disintermediation must fall. And sure, some roles and functions will be made obsolete. But that happens with all progress. The changes in the banking system over the past 40 years have continually pushed some players out at the same time that it’s steadily brought others in.\n\nWith banks, I think it’s more a case of the real estate agent than the travel agent. Here’s the analogy: With the advent of e-commerce, both the travel and housing markets were affected. But only one of them saw the demise of one set of intermediaries. Travel agents largely disappeared because we all know what we want out of a flight, a hotel, or a vacation. It’s something we do often enough and are familiar enough with to trust our own instincts. The risks are small. Buying a plane ticket isn’t inexpensive, but it’s a low-risk proposition in the grand scheme of things. And the value that travel agents brought can be largely replaced by our own Internet research. In this case, the web did replace the travel agent as our intermediary.\n\nWe still have real estate agents, however, even though I can get a 360-degree view of a house that’s five states away from the comfort of my living room. Why? Because real estate agents still add value. They perform a fundamental service that we can’t provide ourselves and can’t be found online — at least not as well. People don’t buy houses that often. I personally don’t want to take on the risk of doing it all myself. I want a professional who knows what papers to file, what zoning laws have to be followed, what surveys should be done, and what market expectations are. Even though the technology has evolved, we still need those intermediaries.\n\nLikewise, no matter what happens in the world of fintech, you still need a trusted broker of money. The roles may change and adapt, but someone needs to be the source of funds and credit.\n\nThere’s always going to be a place for maturity transformation, for instance. When people make longer-term loans, it creates a maturity mismatch on the balance sheet of the lender. This is because the liability side of the balance sheet can evaporate much more rapidly than the asset side, making the lender either illiquid or insolvent.\n\nOne of the key economic contributions of banks is that they manage that risk. A fintech firm is unlikely to have that scope and long-term trust, at least not for a while. Similarly, you and I wouldn’t make good credit card lenders, even if we had the right coding and software. So, those won’t completely disappear, either.\n\nThere will be some disintermediation, but that’s been the case in banking since deregulation started in the 1980s. At the end of the day, we still rely on those institutions to manage risk and provide a safe haven.\n\nThis is where I return to the core principle: The benefit a business or technology creates for markets and the consumer. Banks know they have to focus on the functions that add value. It’s easy for a well-capitalized bank to fund a start-up, let it take the risks, and then adopt the successful technology. Fintech may fully permeate the banking industry, but it will likely be in a way that sees many of the old players adapting new technologies rather than being put out of business by them.\n\nFintech: The Government Leg\n\nThat relates directly to the government part because a large portion of government’s role in fintech will be regulation. Regulators have to think about how to create oversight that doesn’t stifle innovation while simultaneously protecting markets and consumers. The fintech industry has to think about what regulation means for them.\n\nI want to say here that regulation isn’t a bad thing. It’s necessary for a functioning system, and it’s one of the ways to confer the trust that is so essential. And in the case of fintech, it’s in fintech firms’ best interest to know what’s expected from them from the beginning. Otherwise, they may have to play catch-up or retrofit their business model to comply with oversight that comes later. Not to mention, building the trust in the system that regulation can offer makes their businesses more resilient.\n\nMost fintech firms are relatively new. They haven’t been through the downside of a credit cycle. And the unfortunate reality of modernity is that there will be a down cycle. For those companies that are getting to a scale where negative events could have a major impact on their business, regulation is especially important because it acts as a safety net.\n\nMore important, regulation that comes in after a crisis almost always fights the last war. That kind of oversight is generally more restrictive and would likely put far more burden on fintech firms than starting out sooner.\n\nI want regulation that safeguards the consumer, the market, and the emerging fintech industry itself. I like innovation; I like responsible innovation more.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat’s about the long and the short of it. Fintech touches many sectors and it offers some exciting ways to modernize the banking industry. It’s not a radical departure in the sense that the industry has been evolving over the past several decades, but it’s new and interesting in the sense of the technology it offers. I hope the value is equal to the technology, and I think it will be. Because that’s the story at the end. At the end of the day, it’s about efficient market function and protecting the consumer.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Daniel Sanches, “On the Inherent Instability of Private Money,” Review of Economic Dynamics, 20 (2016), pp. 198–214.\n\n[2]Jerome Powell, “Innovation, Technology, and the Payments System,” speech given at Blockchain: The Future of Finance and Capital Markets?

            "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here, and I want to thank everyone for coming, even those of you who are just trying to get out of class.\n\nToday I’d like to talk about the economy as a whole, which I’m sure you expect of a Fed president. But I’d like to start with a refresher course on the Fed and what it is we do as well as a sort of monetary policy 101. That’s not to assume no one knows what we do, although I’m often surprised at cocktail parties to hear how much power people think I have. I can’t single-handedly move markets, although it’s flattering people think so.\n\nIt’s more to reset the wider conversation about where the U.S. economy is today, what challenges we’re facing, and what can be done to really change its course. And, frankly, since I have a captive audience, I’m not missing an opportunity to talk to the next generation of potential Fed employees.\n\nBefore I begin, the first rule of the Fed club is: Don’t talk about the Fed club until you’ve delivered the standard disclaimer — the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed: Overview\n\nFirst, the very basic overview. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks across the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. I’m president of the Philadelphia Fed, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. Each of the regional Banks is an independent entity, and we represent our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate monetary policy.\n\nWe do that roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meetings. That’s where we vote on monetary policy, which is now mostly about moving interest rates.\n\nThe governors always have a vote as does the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate onto voting positions. I’m voting this year for the first time. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence.\n\nWhen we’re not in a voting position, we’re still part of the conversation. One of the benefits of the System is that we get to be the voices for the people in our regions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate outlined by Congress: price stability and maximum employment. We also regulate banks, process payments, and conduct economic research.\n\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work in our communities to help strengthen local economies. We have an exceptional team in Philadelphia, and I’m not just saying that because they make me look good. We recently had Chair Yellen come with us to visit the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which connects unemployed people in the area with employers. The Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development team works with organizations to promote stronger economies through everything from skills training to research on economic mobility. And they connect people and issues to the resources they need.\n\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a lot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In Philadelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\n\nSo, that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy: The Basics\n\nThat said, monetary policy is still the big one. And that’s where I come — if you’ll indulge me — to my second primer of the day: monetary policy 101.\n\nMonetary policy is not the all-powerful tool it’s often portrayed as. It’s relatively limited in its scope, and it’s a relatively blunt instrument. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\n\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance. But the majority of it is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\n\nFiscal and other policy areas are where you’ll find the decisions that really affect things like growth. The Fed creates the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. We till the land and make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the crops — are decisions beyond our control, which brings me to where we stand now in our role and our decisions.\n\nThe economy, overall, is in pretty good shape. After eight-plus long years of recovery, the economy is more or less back to full health.\n\nWe added 227,000 jobs in January, continuing a steady pace of employment. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, at or below my estimate of the natural rate.\n\nI want to say here that when Fed policymakers talk about employment, we’re doing it at a national level. I’m not blind to the realities on the ground, particularly in my own District. There are pockets here and around the country that have been left out of the rebound. There are demographics that have been persistently cut out of that good labor-market fortune. The unemployment rate for African American men, for example, was 8 percent in January.\n\nWe make policy at a national level, so we look at national averages. But we understand that there are areas that still need particular focus. It’s part of the reason we, as presidents, make sure we feed back the realities on the ground in our Districts. Some of the issues we can help address through our community development work, but most of it is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nAs for inflation, that’s been a little more stubborn, but we’re on track there as well. The myth about inflation is that the Fed is only concerned about it when it gets too high. In truth, we have a goal of 2 percent, and we worry about deviation in either direction. I don’t mean we run around with our hair on fire if it’s a little higher or a little lower once in a while. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nIt surprises some people that the issue with inflation over the past few years is that it’s been too low. That sounds odd to a lot of people, especially those of us who lived through the high inflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The students in the audience definitely won’t remember that, and I think some of the faculty might even be too young.\n\nIn any event, we’re starting to see upward movement on our goal, and I see inflation rising to meet our target sometime late this year or early next, which means that we’re essentially at our goal.\n\nOur job now is to maintain the land and keep conditions right for economic growth.\n\nFor our part, that’s about how we manage interest rates. I see three hikes as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe growth part, however, is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nSo, what really does move the economy?\n\nAnd what problems are we actually facing?\n\nI think it’s safe to say there are a lot of opinions about both of those. And I hear most of them. Whether I like it or not …\n\nSo, I’d like to cut through the noise.\n\nWith employment generally at our goal and inflation on track to meet it, the issue now is growth.\n\nFrom an economic modeling standpoint, growth right now is more or less what we should consider normal. My forecast for 2017 is a touch above 2 percent.\n\nIf we want to move that needle, we need to address the underlying factors that are keeping it at its current rate.\n\nGrowth is fundamentally productivity plus growth of the labor force, and therein lie two of the bigger problems facing the American economy.\n\nProductivity\n\nI’ll start with productivity. Productivity has been falling lately — not just in the U.S., incidentally, but globally. And to some extent, the reasons are a mystery.\n\nThere is one school of thought, popularized by the economist Robert Gordon, that productivity has been spurred throughout history by big, game-changing inventions. Think steam engine, electricity, the Internet. And that the only way we will see productivity on par with past surges is if some revolutionary new invention again changes the way we do business. Well, wait a minute. Doesn’t the vast world of Internet-enabled work count? In this theory, not really. The explanation would be that in the first tech revolution, most of the innovation went to making businesses work more efficiently, letting them produce more with less. In this iteration, the majority of the disruption has been in areas of leisure rather than business. Some might even argue that the availability of such personal distractions has caused us to be less productive because we’re more distracted.\n\nThis might sound terrifying because what else is there to invent? But in this view of the world, all isn’t lost because we never really know when the next big revolution is around the corner.\n\nI’m not personally dedicated to this theory. I think there are ways to increase productivity. But it’s been a potent and interesting point of discussion.\n\nThe other question most often posed is whether we’re measuring productivity correctly. With all the web-based business out there, is it even possible to measure output? Aren’t we assessing productivity on an outdated scale?\n\nThe first thing I’ll say is that productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. And the economy may be changing in ways that make it even harder. We have the best minds available working on this, but they fully admit it’s difficult to keep up. For example, how do we include smartphone apps that are downloadable for free in measures of output? Research at our Bank suggests that, even if we correct for this, it would only make a small difference in the rate of output growth. So, our best guess remains that productivity has slowed, while at the same time, there is widespread agreement that output and productivity are likely somewhat greater than we think. Welcome to the dismal science.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nThe second factor in the growth equation is the labor force.\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk lately about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate. There is some thought that it might be significantly higher than the official numbers say.\n\nTo dig into this, I should outline a few measures of how we gauge the health of the labor market.\n\nSome of it is what you hear frequently: U3 unemployment. You’re all econ and finance majors, so you know that’s the basic measure of the unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. You’re unemployed if you’re looking for a job. If you’ve just graduated and you’re on your first search, you’re part of that number. If you’re looking for work after some time off, you’re part of it, too. If you’ve retired, if you’re not working by choice, if you’re taking a break, you’re not considered unemployed. U3, as I said, is currently 4.8 percent.\n\nYou also know that the U6 measure is more involved. For the uninitiated, that one takes U3 and adds people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time, and people who say they’d like a job but stopped looking. U6 currently stands at 9.4 percent.\n\nWe also look at how many people are quitting their jobs, which reflects how confident they are that they’ll find another. We look at how many net new jobs were created. We look at what we hear from businesses about how hard it is to fill positions, and a host of other information.\n\nThen there is the labor force participation rate. This is where things get sticky.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a measure of what proportion of the working-age population is either employed or looking for a job. It’s easy to look at this and draw some unsettling conclusions, especially when I tell you that the labor force participation rate is currently 62.9 percent.\n\nThis is the number that alarms some people, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.\n\nFirst of all, we define the working-age population as everyone over the age of 16. So, that means your kid brother who’s a junior in high school and my 92-year-old mother are both counted. Second of all, we’re dealing with a different population than we have in the past. The baby boomers represent the biggest generation in history to start moving into retirement, and we’re living longer in general. I’m pretty pleased about the last one, frankly. Ultimately, the pool of people not seeking employment for very good reasons is much larger, skewing the overall number.\n\nSo, in the sense that low labor force participation points to an unemployment rate that is radically higher than official numbers suggest, that’s not really the case.\n\nIt is, however, a problem. Just for different reasons.\n\nThe participation rate has been declining in recent years. There are a few factors that influence that. For one, people are staying in school longer, and many younger people aren’t working while they’re there. For another, some people have decided that they’re happy with a one-income household, often reflecting preferences of work–life balance.\n\nThe third, as I mentioned, is that the baby boomers are heading into retirement. This is the big one.\n\nI say this is the big one because research by my staff shows that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\n\nAnd since the vast majority of the decline comes from the onset of the baby boomers’ retirement, they don’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate will drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.2\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nIt’s a big deal because participation affects growth. As an example, if you look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, you’ll see that after the bottom out in 2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the next six years. That’s not just slow for a recovery; it’s slow by historical averages. In comparison, in the second half of the 20th century, growth averaged 3.5 percent. A full 1.7 percent of that came just from the expansion of the American workforce. Over the course of the recovery, by contrast, the labor force has grown by an average of about 0.5 percent. That’s less than half the historical average.\n\nWe also have to think about the economic pressures that demographics put on us as a country. With an unprecedented wave of Americans heading into retirement and living longer to boot, we’re talking about a lot of resources. Social Security, Medicare, living expenses in general. While the millennial generation is slightly larger than the boomers, they’re not yet fully in the workforce, and even the oldest of them still aren’t in their prime earning years.\n\nThe changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.3\n\nDeclining participation equals shrinking output. That is, with fewer workers, the U.S. will produce less. When we produce less, growth stalls. Ultimately, successful and healthy economies have high participation rates.\n\nPolicy Possibilities\n\nNow that I’ve scared the daylights out of everyone, can anything be done?\n\nAgain, the solutions to these problems lie in areas outside monetary policy. Since I know how it feels to have someone else comment on the job you’re doing, let me be clear that I’m not telling elected officials what to do. I’m just a policy wonk with too much data on my hands, and I follow the numbers.\n\nSo, please take this next part as simply the analysis of an impartial, data-driven party.\n\nAs pertains to productivity and growth overall, investment in human and physical capital are vital; that is, education, science, health, and the infrastructure of our cities and towns. These help create a strong and diversified workforce and will help America keep its edge as a leader in innovation across sectors.\n\nOne of the areas we’ve focused on at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to education and professional readiness.\n\nThe data show that there’s a skills gap. There are jobs out there that can’t be filled because people just don’t have the right training. That’s the big problem in many industries: They can’t fill jobs because not enough people are trained to do them.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make post-secondary education one-size-fits-all when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\n\nOn the participation side of things, we can only grow as fast as our workforce can take on the work. Right now, we just don’t have the people, unless we want my mother and her friends to come out of retirement. But I’m pretty sure we’d have a fight on our hands …\n\nWe need more bodies in the workforce. How and whether we make the decision to do something about it is again out of my hands. And I don’t want to wade into turbulent political waters. But the bottom line is that we don’t have enough people, and pulling talent in from outside the United States is one way to solve the problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is and has been an economic powerhouse for most of the past century. We’re the world’s largest economy, and we have consistently been a source of innovation and invention. If we want to keep our global edge, it’s time to think about broad policies that look to where we’ll be in the future. When I was playing football, we ran where the ball was headed to catch it; that’s how we have to look at policy — monetary, fiscal, and other — not where we are on the field but where we’re headed.\n\nWith that, I’m happy to turn the floor over to some questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Research Rap Special Report, February 2014.\n\n[2]Fujita.\n\n[3]James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, 89:1, February 2007, pp. 100–109.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you. It’s always a pleasure to be back home at Wharton.\n\nToday I’ll give a brief overview of the economy, my outlook for the next year or so — including the path of monetary policy — and then talk a little bit about a subject that’s probably near and dear to a lot of your hearts: student debt.\n\nBefore I begin, I’ll start the way I always do with the standard proviso that my views today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLabor market\n\nWith that out of the way, things are looking pretty good.\n\nWe started off the year with a strong labor market. We added 227,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, which is at or below my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. That’s a slight uptick from December, but it reflects more people coming off the sidelines and back into the labor force. So in this case, it’s a positive outcome.\n\nU6 unemployment is 9.4 percent. While that’s still higher than I’d like, it’s a far cry from the bad old days of the recession and its aftermath when U6 reached a peak of about 17 percent.\n\nQuits are still high, layoffs remain low, and job postings are near historical peaks. My business contacts continue to tell me that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting more and more difficult.\n\nTaking that all into account, the labor market continues to tighten. And I see it as more or less back to full health.\n\nWhenever I talk about the labor market, I’m always careful to point out that just because things are good — or even healthy — doesn’t mean they’re perfect. There continue to be pockets in the country — both geographically and demographically — that aren’t feeling the relief. We have a lot of them in the Fed’s Third District: post-industrial towns, rural areas, and the urban landscape. Philadelphia is the poorest of the 10 biggest cities in America, and Camden has, at various times, been called the poorest city in America period. Among different segments of the population, the unemployment rate for African American men remains at 8.0 percent, significantly higher than the national average.\n\nWe need to pay special attention to the regions and demographic groups that have been left behind. The Fed can help to some extent through our community development work, which focuses on strengthening local economies. But for the most part, monetary policy doesn’t have the scope or tools to address these issues head on. That takes legislative action.\n\nAnd while I’m relatively upbeat about employment, there’s still room for wage growth to move up. While the continued improvement in the labor market has moved the needle on wage growth — as of January, the year-over-year growth was about 2.5 percent — previous expansions have seen sustained growth of above 3 percent. That’s what we expect in a robust economy.\n\nInflation\n\nMoving on to inflation, we’re seeing positive upward movement, although PCE remains below our 2 percent target. Headline and core PCE closed out last year at 1.6 and 1.7 percent, respectively. That’s a world of improvement over the end of 2015, when they were at 0.6 and 1.4 percent.\n\nWe do have January numbers for CPI inflation, with headline CPI rising a remarkable 0.6 percent, driven largely by an increase in gas prices. That brings the year-over-year change to 2.5 percent. Core CPI rose 0.3 percent, bringing that year-over-year change to above 2 percent.\n\nI should note that inflation as measured by CPI is often higher than PCE. That said, it still indicates an overall upward movement, and I see us reaching our 2 percent target on PCE sometime this year or next.\n\nAnother positive indicator is that we’re starting to see inflation expectations rally around the 2 percent goal.\n\nGrowth\n\nTurning to growth, real GDP increased 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. A substantial drag from net exports slowed growth there. While real GDP growth was stronger in the second half of 2016 — after it grew by 3.5 percent in the third quarter — we’re really looking at moderate growth overall, averaging just under 2 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters points to 2.2 percent growth in the current quarter.\n\nRetail sales have been strong, rising 0.4 percent in January. In fact, we’ve seen a rapid acceleration in retail sales since the middle of last year. And consumer confidence has continued the upward trend it started in 2016, carrying into this year.\n\nOverall, I see strong consumer spending driving growth of about 2 percent over the course of the year. And that 2 percent growth is more or less what we should consider normal for the medium term.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nSo, what does all this mean for monetary policy? Given the state of the economy — more or less back to normal — I continue to see three modest rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track.\n\nI’ve said it before and I don’t mind repeating myself: Monetary policy is a fairly limited tool that is fairly limited in its scope. A lot of people would like to see growth above our 2 percent projection, but that’s not really up to Fed officials. That’s the kind of policy that’s outside our purview.\n\nIf we really want to move the needle, we need to invest in physical and human capital.\n\nStudent loans\n\nAnd that’s where I come to the subject of student loans.\n\nI should mention that different Federal Reserve Banks have different areas of research focus. Dallas, as you might imagine, spends a lot of time looking at energy markets. In Philadelphia, we’re the System leaders in research on consumer credit and finance. So, we have a lot of expertise in this area.\n\nThere’s no question that investing in the education of our citizens is essential for growth and is the core of our economic future. We’re talking about the engine of the American economy: The men and women who will be creating the next miracle drug, inventing the next radical technological innovation, writing the next wave of legislation.\n\nBut there’s an all-too-familiar problem that can act as a barrier to people getting the education they need.\n\nTo steal a line from John Oliver, if you went to college in America, chances are you have two things: Bob Marley’s greatest hits and student debt.\n\nThe headlines you’ve heard before, and they’re fairly staggering:\n\nThe number of people with student debt doubled between 2000 and 2014, for a total of about 42 million. Aggregate student loan debt in the U.S. is currently nearly $1.3 trillion.1\n\nThe average student loan borrower has about $31,000 in outstanding balances, whereas the typical American borrower owes over $16,000.2\n\nAnd 11 percent of balances are past due, compared with 8 percent 10 years ago. It should be noted, however, that the delinquencies have been coming down since the peak of 12 percent in 2012.3\n\nThat’s the data we’re used to hearing, and that’s what most of the conversation is about, for good reason.\n\nBut there are more data and some nuances to the numbers that bear investigating. Because if we’re going to reach policy conclusions — and for the record, I’m not going to reach any policy conclusions because that’s not my job — we should dig a little deeper.\n\nFirst and foremost, defaults on smaller loans are actually more common than on big ones.\n\nThere are a number of factors that play into this, but there are some trends that emerge.\n\nLarger loans tend be taken on by people attending four-year institutions, and those students tend to complete school at a higher rate. They may have more debt when they graduate, but graduating makes them more likely to find a job and a better paying one at that. So, those students tend to be in a better position to repay loans.\n\nStudents at for-profit colleges or two-year programs are generally in school for shorter periods of time, which is part of the reason the amounts are smaller. However, a significant portion of these students are unlikely to finish their degree or certificate. And people who don’t complete their programs are more likely to default.\n\nThis is largely because they struggle to find jobs that pay enough to both repay loans and cover the general cost of living. That was made exponentially worse by the recession and the attendant weak labor market.\n\nIn 2013, for instance, the unemployment rate for borrowers who were recent graduates of four-year, public, and nonprofit institutions was 7.7 — only a little higher than the overall average unemployment rate for that year.\n\nBy contrast, recent graduates of two-year colleges had an unemployment rate of 16.9 percent. More alarmingly, those who went to for-profit schools had an unemployment rate of 20.6 percent.4 To put that in perspective, we would literally have to go back to the Great Depression to get a national level of unemployment that high.\n\nThe recession was also marked by a dramatic increase in attendance at two-year and for-profit colleges. These schools accounted for roughly half of the increase in student debt between 2009 and 2011. This increase was part of a longer-term trend that highlights a lot of the data I’ve just talked about. From 2003 to 2013, over 30 percent of the increase in student debt was taken on by students from those institutions.5\n\nWhat does this tell us, and why does this matter?\n\nI’m not ignoring the issues facing students who graduated on time from four-year institutions and found good jobs when they left. Being in a better state than their counterparts doesn’t lessen the blow of a few decades of paying off loans. And it still has implications for the broader economy: Millennials are now technically a larger generation than the baby boomers, and owing money affects the way they live and participate in the economy. There’s a good amount of research that links student debt to younger adults being unable to move out on their own. Some of it finds a big enough effect to impact the housing market.\n\nBut we should also look at the way the segmentation of the student debt market impacts the way we view the issue, and, more broadly, how we approach policy.\n\nFundamentally, this is a question of how we look at skills, the labor force, and the ways in which we prepare people for professional success.\n\nI’m always careful to avoid wading into debates about how elected officials should make policy. There are larger questions about the allocation of funds at the local, state, and federal levels that I’m going to sidestep.\n\nWhat I can address is some of the data and research.\n\nI’m frequently amazed at the simplicity of programs that have demonstrable effects. Case in point, there is evidence to suggest that by simply offering high school students more intensive, personalized information about college options, they make better, more successful choices.6\n\nLikewise, a more flexible approach to repayment can keep people from winding up in a debt cycle that can permanently affect their credit.\n\nAt the moment, student debt holders have the option of programs that protect them from spending more than 10 percent of their income on repayment. But they have to reapply annually, filling out the kind of complex sets of forms that bureaucracy is famous for. And eligibility is based on the previous year’s income, which means if you lose your job, you won’t be off the hook for payments for quite a while. The complexity — and probably the frustration — of the process keeps a lot of people out of the process who could use the help.7\n\nOne possible solution can be found in our counterparts overseas. Repayments are automatically linked to income through the tax systems in countries like Australia, the UK, New Zealand, and others. In addition to the relief it gives people paying off student loans, it reduces the dreaded reams of paperwork.\n\nAnother issue altogether is thinking about how we address tertiary education on a societal level. When my parents were growing up, all you needed for a good job was a high school diploma. That was still true for some of my generation, but that necessity quickly turned to being a college degree. I bet a lot of you and your friends feel that you won’t be competitive in the marketplace without a master’s.\n\nThe thing is we don’t all need or want the same educational track. A traditional four-year degree is great for some people. Ditto a post-graduate degree.\n\nFor others, it’s not necessarily the right path. And we should stop making people feel as though they all need to fit into the same mold.\n\nOne of our research areas at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to education and professional readiness.\n\nThe data show a skills gap. I hear it all the time from my business contacts: They have the jobs — they just don’t have the people to fill them because they don’t have the right training.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce.\n\nI saw this in action when I visited the Academies at Roxborough High School with my Community Development staff. This is a program that trains high school students to be career ready when they graduate, so they can make the move into jobs that will pay them a good wage. Some of them will go on to traditional four-year programs, some will get further technical or vocational training, some will start their career path right out of the gate. But they’ll all have the opportunity to make a living while they’re pursuing either more education or moving along their professional pathway or both.\n\nIf we approach education and the needs of the workforce from a different angle, we can save a lot of the heaviest-hit students a world of debt hurt.\n\nConclusion\n\nI can’t formulate education policy, or allocate funds, or even make my own children study what I want them to — although, of course, I’m immensely proud of them and they’ve made excellent choices without listening to me.\n\nBut I can point to the research and what the data say. Changing our approach to how we invest in education and training won’t take care of the entire student debt issue, but it can help those who are disproportionately affected by it.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]FRBNY Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, November 2016.

            "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here, and I want to thank everyone for coming, even those of you who are just trying to get out of class.\n\nToday I’d like to talk about the economy as a whole, which I’m sure you expect of a Fed president. But I’d like to start out with a refresher course on the Fed and what it is we do as well as a sort of monetary policy 101. That’s not to assume no one knows what we do, although I’m often surprised at cocktail parties to hear how much power people think I have. I can’t single-handedly move markets, although it’s flattering people think so. It’s more to reset the wider conversation about where the U.S. economy is today, what challenges we’re facing, and what can be done to really change its course. And, frankly, with so many La Salle students in the audience, I’m not missing an opportunity to talk to the next generation of potential Fed employees.\n\nBefore I begin, the first rule of the Fed club is: Don’t talk about the Fed club until you’ve delivered the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed: Overview\n\nFirst, the very basic overview. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks across the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. I’m president of the Philadelphia Fed, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. Each of the regional Banks is an independent entity, and we represent our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate monetary policy.\n\nWe do that roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meetings. That’s where we vote on monetary policy, which is now mostly about moving interest rates.\n\nThe governors always have a vote as does the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate on to voting positions. I’m voting this year for the first time. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence.\n\nWhen we’re not in a voting position, we’re still part of the conversation. One of the benefits of the System is that we get to be the voices for the people in our regions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has two responsibilities outlined by Congress, what’s referred to as our dual mandate. Those are price stability and maximum employment. In their very simplest terms — with apologies to any economists in the room who hate it when we put things in their simplest terms — that’s first, low and stable inflation. And second, that — for the most part — if you’re looking for a job, you can find one. That isn’t a guarantee for every single person or that the job you get is the one you want; it’s a cold and analytical assessment of the overall state of the labor market in a massive economy.\n\nThe Fed also regulates banks, processes payments, and conducts economic research.\n\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work in our communities to help strengthen local economies. We have an exceptional team in Philadelphia, and I’m not just saying that because they make me look good. We recently had Chair Yellen come with us to visit the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which connects unemployed people in the area with employers. The Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development team works with organizations to promote stronger economies through everything from skills training to research on economic mobility. And they connect people and issues to the resources they need.\n\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a lot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In Philadelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\n\nSo, that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy: The Basics\n\nThat said, monetary policy is still the big one. And that’s where I come — if you’ll indulge me — to my second primer of the day: monetary policy 101.\n\nMonetary policy is not the all-powerful tool it’s often portrayed as. It’s relatively limited in its scope, and it’s a relatively blunt instrument. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\n\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance, which is just policy speak for telling people what to expect.\n\nHowever, the majority of what we do is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\n\nThe policy decisions that affect things like debts and deficits, taxes and spending, are made by elected officials. Those are fiscal policy.\n\nFiscal and other policy areas are where you find the decisions that really affect things like growth. The Fed creates the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. We till the land and make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the crops — are decisions beyond our control, which brings me to where we stand now in our role and our decisions.\n\nThe economy, overall, is in pretty good shape. After eight-plus long years of recovery, the economy is more or less back to full health.\n\nWe added 227,000 jobs in January, continuing a steady pace of employment. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, at or below what economists term the “natural rate” of unemployment. That’s the rate we can expect in a healthy economy.\n\nI want to say here that when Fed policymakers talk about employment, we’re doing it at a national level. I’m not blind to the realities on the ground, particularly in my own District. There are pockets here and around the country that have been left out of the rebound. There are demographics that have been persistently cut out of that good labor-market fortune: The unemployment rate for African American men, for example, was 8.0 percent in January.\n\nWe make policy at a national level, so we look at national averages. But we understand that there are areas that still need particular focus; it’s part of the reason we, as presidents, make sure we feed back the realities on the ground in our Districts. Some of the issues we can help address through our community development work, but most of it is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nAs for inflation, that’s been a little more stubborn, but we’re on track there as well. The myth about inflation is that the Fed is only concerned about it when it gets too high. In truth, we have a goal of 2 percent, and we worry about deviation in either direction. I don’t mean we run around with our hair on fire if it’s a little higher or a little lower once in a while. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nIt surprises some people that the issue with inflation over the past few years is that it’s been too low. That sounds odd to a lot of people, especially those of us who lived through the high inflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The students in the audience definitely won’t remember that, and I think some of the faculty might even be too young.\n\nIn any event, we’re starting to see upward movement on our goal, and I see inflation rising to meet our target sometime late this year or next, which means that we’re essentially at our goal.\n\nOur job now is to maintain the land and keep conditions right for economic growth.\n\nFor our part, that’s about how we manage interest rates. I see three hikes as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe growth part, however, is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nSo, what really does move the economy?\n\nAnd what problems are we actually facing?\n\nI think it’s safe to say there are a lot of opinions about both of those. And I hear most of them. Whether I like it or not …\n\nSo, I’d like to cut through the noise.\n\nWith employment generally at our goal and inflation on track to meet it, the issue now is growth.\n\nFrom an economic modeling standpoint, growth right now is more or less what we should consider normal. My forecast for 2017 is a touch above 2 percent.\n\nIf we want to move that needle, we need to address the underlying factors that are keeping it at its current rate.\n\nGrowth is fundamentally productivity plus growth of the labor force, and therein lie two of the bigger problems facing the American economy.\n\nProductivity\n\nI’ll start with productivity. Productivity is defined as output per unit of input. Basically, how much cost and effort it takes to produce a single unit of a good.\n\nProductivity has been falling lately — not just in the U.S., incidentally, but globally. And to some extent, the reasons are a mystery.\n\nThere is one school of thought, popularized by the economist Robert Gordon, that productivity has been spurred throughout history by big, game-changing inventions. Think steam engine, electricity, the Internet. And that the only way we will see productivity on par with past surges is if some revolutionary new invention again changes the way we do business. Well, wait a minute. Doesn’t the vast world of Internet-enabled work count? In this theory, not really. The explanation would be that in the first tech revolution, most of the innovation went into making businesses work more efficiently, letting them produce more with less. In this iteration, the majority of the disruption has been in areas of leisure rather than business. Some might even argue that the availability of such personal distractions has caused us to be less productive because we’re more distracted.\n\nThis might sound terrifying because what else is there to invent? But in this view of the world, all isn’t lost because we never really know when the next big revolution is around the corner.\n\nI’m not personally dedicated to this theory. I think there are ways to increase productivity. But it’s been a potent and interesting point of discussion.\n\nThe other question most often posed is whether we’re measuring productivity correctly. With all the web-based business out there, is it even possible to measure output? Aren’t we assessing productivity on an outdated scale?\n\nThe first thing I’ll say is that productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. And the economy may be changing in ways that make it even harder. We have the best minds available working on this, but they fully admit it’s difficult to keep up. For example, how do we include smartphone apps that are downloadable for free in measures of output? Research at our Bank suggests that, even if we correct for this, it would only make a small difference in the rate of output growth. So, our best guess remains that productivity has slowed, while at the same time, there is widespread agreement that output and productivity are likely somewhat greater than we think. Welcome to the dismal science.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nThe second factor in the growth equation is the labor force.\n\nYou’ve probably heard a lot of talk lately about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate. There is some thought that it might be significantly higher than the official numbers say.\n\nTo dig into this, I should outline a few measures of how we gauge the health of the labor market.\n\nSome of it is what you hear frequently: the unemployment rate. That number is actually what we call U3 unemployment. That’s the basic measure of the unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. You’re unemployed if you’re looking for a job; if you’ve just graduated and you’re on your first search, you’re part of that number. If you’re looking for work after some time off, you’re part of it, too. If you’ve retired, if you’re not working by choice, if you’re taking a break, you’re not considered unemployed. U3, as I said, is currently 4.8 percent.\n\nThe U6 measure is more involved. That one takes U3 and adds people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time and people who say they’d like a job but stopped looking. U6 currently stands at 9.4 percent.\n\nWe also look at how many people are quitting their jobs, which reflects how confident they are that they’ll find another. We look at how many net new jobs were created. We look at what we hear from businesses about how hard it is to fill positions, and a host of other information.\n\nThen there is the labor force participation rate. This is where things get sticky.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a measure of what proportion of the working-age population is either employed or looking for a job. It’s easy to look at this and draw some unsettling conclusions, especially when I tell you that the labor force participation rate is currently 62.9 percent.\n\nThis is the number that alarms some people. But there’s more to it than meets the eye.\n\nFirst of all, we define the working-age population as everyone over the age of 16. So, that means your kid brother who’s a junior in high school and my 92-year-old mother are both counted. Second of all, we’re dealing with a different population than we have in the past. The baby boomers represent the biggest generation in history to start moving into retirement, and we’re living longer in general. I’m pretty pleased about the last one, frankly. Ultimately, the pool of people not seeking employment for very good reasons is much larger, skewing the overall number.\n\nSo, in the sense that low labor force participation points to an unemployment rate that is radically higher than official numbers suggest, that’s not really the case.\n\nIt is, however, a problem, just for different reasons.\n\nThe participation rate has been declining in recent years. There are a few factors that influence that. For one, people are staying in school longer and many younger people aren’t working while they’re there. For another, some people have decided that they’re happy with a one-income household, often reflecting preferences of work–life balance.\n\nThe third — and this is the big one — is, as I mentioned, that the baby boomers are heading into retirement.\n\nI say this is the big one because research by my staff shows that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\n\nAnd because the vast majority of the decline comes from the onset of the baby boomers’ retirement, they don’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate will drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.2\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nIt’s a big deal because participation affects growth. As an example: If you look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, you’ll see that after the bottom out in 2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the next six years. That’s not just slow for a recovery; it’s slow by historical averages. In comparison, in the second half of the 20th century, growth averaged 3.5 percent. A full 1.7 percent of that came just from the expansion of the American workforce. Over the course of the recovery, by contrast, the labor force has grown by an average of about 0.5 percent. That’s less than half the historical average.\n\nWe also have to think about the economic pressures that demographics put on us as a country. With an unprecedented wave of Americans heading into retirement and living longer to boot, we’re talking about a lot of resources: Social Security, Medicare, living expenses in general. While the millennial generation is slightly larger than the boomers, they’re not yet fully in the workforce, and even the oldest of them still aren’t in their prime earning years.\n\nThe changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.3\n\nDeclining participation equals shrinking output. That is, with fewer workers, the U.S. will produce less. When we produce less, growth stalls. Ultimately, successful and healthy economies have high participation rates.\n\nPolicy Possibilities\n\nNow that I’ve scared the daylights out of everyone, can anything be done?\n\nAgain, the solutions to these problems lie in areas outside monetary policy. Since I know how it feels to have someone else comment on the job you’re doing, let me be clear that I’m not telling elected officials what to do. I’m just a policy wonk with too much data on my hands, and I follow the numbers.\n\nSo, please take this next part as simply the analysis of an impartial, data-driven party.\n\nAs pertains to productivity and growth overall, investment in human and physical capital are vital; that is, education, science, health, and the infrastructure of our cities and towns. These help create a strong and diversified workforce and will help America keep its edge as a leader in innovation across sectors.\n\nOne of the areas we’ve focused on at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to education and professional readiness.\n\nThe data show that there’s a skills gap. That is, there are jobs out there that can’t be filled because people just don’t have the right training. That’s the big problem in many industries: there are jobs but not enough people who can do them.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make post-secondary education one-size-fits-all when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\n\nOn the participation side of things, we can only grow as fast as our workforce can take on the work. Right now, we just don’t have the people, unless we want my mother and her friends to come out of retirement. But I’m pretty sure we’d have a fight on our hands …\n\nWe need more bodies in the workforce. How and whether we make the decision to do something about it is again out of my hands. And I don’t want to wade into turbulent political waters. But the bottom line is that we don’t have enough people, and pulling talent in from outside the United States is one way to solve the problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is and has been an economic powerhouse for most of the past century. We’re the world’s largest economy, and we have consistently been a source of innovation and invention. If we want to keep our global edge, it’s time to think about broad policies that look to where we’ll be in the future. When I was playing football, we ran where the ball was headed to catch it; that’s how we have to look at policy — monetary, fiscal, and other — not where we are on the field but where we’re headed.\n\nI hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time, and I’m happy to turn the floor over to some questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014).\n\n[2]See Fujita.\n\n[3]James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 89(1), pp. 100–109 (February 2007).",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you. I’d like to start by saying that I’m a proud and loyal son of the Federal Reserve System’s Third District, which encompasses the eastern portion of Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. I’m proud of the people, the places, and our contributions. With that said, thank you for getting me out of that weather and inviting me to San Diego.\n\nWe’re here today to discuss “payment systems in the Internet age,” a subject that could occupy a full month’s conference and that brings up interesting complexities for anyone interested or invested in the subject.\n\nIt is also something of a complex topic for someone involved in regulation, so I should note from the outset that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, I’d like to talk today about how fintech has evolved and the role it plays in the overall financial system. That involves going back to first principles, because whenever we’re dealing with emerging areas of regulation, it’s important to address what that oversight is and isn’t addressing.\n\nThe Evolution of Fintech\n\nThose of us who’ve been watching the evolution of what we now call fintech can probably agree that it existed before the headlines it’s garnered over the past five or six years. That, in fact, they reflect changes that have been in motion since the ’90s and early 2000s.\n\nI don’t want to diminish the inventive spirit evinced by the tech sector. But it’s important to remember that the application of technology to financial institutions and functions has been going on for some time. We sometimes forget, with the incredible innovation coming out of Silicon Valley — and Silicon Alley, and Silicon Beach, and all the other hubs this country has produced — that the tech revolution is advancing into middle age, which is only to say that we’ve been watching the disruption of various sectors — even ones as staid and resistant to change as financial services — for a while now.\n\nWe’ve gone from hardware-oriented to software-oriented innovation, and IT has become much more sensitive and responsive. Internet capabilities have advanced by leaps and bounds just in the past decade, changing the game for front-end functions. This makes it possible for startups to reach consumers in a way that only banks could do 25 years ago. In many instances, this has inverted the relationship between consumers and service providers and banks.\n\nSo, if you ask anyone who’s old enough to have witnessed the industry evolve since that time — a time when many of the people creating today’s software were just being born — you’ll hear that major change has come but also that, in some ways, everything old is new again. We’re just finding new platforms.\n\nTake peer-to-peer lending, an area that’s captured particular attention. Lenders and lendees are connected in ways they haven’t been before, and there’s a spirit of inclusion and a feeling of active participation, which is wonderful. But even that movement is essentially adding a technological edge to something we’ve been doing since humankind embarked on a system of goods and trade in kind. In my day, it happened over beers at the corner bar, when Eddie asked Joey to loan him a 20. Peer-to-peer lending has been going on since time immemorial. What makes fintech different is that the scope of its ability to match people with one another is infinitely broader.\n\nDefining Fintech\n\nWhich brings me to what, exactly, we mean by fintech. While it doesn’t have a fully accepted definition, I think we can all agree that fintech is more or less the application of technology to the financial services sector.\n\nIt may seem odd to define it, but there is honestly some confusion. And with so many firms calling themselves fintech, it’s good to lay down a baseline. So, for the purposes of our discussion today, I’ll be talking about fintech firms as those that apply technological innovation to financial functions and systems.\n\nBanking and Financial Systems: First Principles\n\nAlso for the purposes of our discussion today, I am going to get even more basic and establish what those systems are, why they exist, and what underpins them.\n\nThe evolution of financial systems and intermediation has been studied and commented upon for centuries. It evoked renewed interest after the global crisis as people began to reexamine the purpose of markets and the role of the financial system.\n\nWhile there is a lot to dissect with regard to the various innovations of financial vehicles and the ways in which institutions are structured, a financial system is fundamental to the human experience as we know it.\n\nThese systems evolved because humanity is driven to find comforts beyond subsistence-level living. We can’t buy food or shelter in the modern age without a system of payments, finance, and credit. And our incorporation of a financial system has existed in some form for most of our history. Whether it was trading or banking, societies across the globe have operated on the premise of: You have something I want or need, and I will give you something in exchange. From the central agora to apps on our phones, whether it’s a creditor’s note or a series of 1s and 0s, the essentials of the system have stood the test of time.\n\nAt its most basic, the financial system exists to keep savings safe; to ensure that people and businesses can easily price, buy, and sell things; and to make certain that we can all use our financial resources to their best advantage, whether that means paying for food and housing, getting an education, expanding businesses, or investing our assets.\n\nThis is critical for all of us because a strong and sound economy can only exist when it’s underpinned by a strong and sound financial system.\n\nAnd what underpins a strong and sound financial system is trust.\n\nAdam Smith said, “All money is a matter of belief,” and it naturally follows that all financial systems are a matter of trust. A financial system can only exist if we collectively agree to it. A system of savings, credit, exchange, and investment survives because we have faith in people we don’t know, currency we have no individual control over, payment systems with inner workings we don’t see, and institutions we grant power to — both to house and to regulate those systems.\n\nWhy do I mention these? Because they are central to the next steps for fintech.\n\nFintech: What’s Next\n\nWhile I noted that fintech is just the latest iteration of changes we’ve been seeing for a few decades now, it is still new from a regulatory standpoint, and it’s likely heading into uncharted territory. It’s unlikely that increased oversight will be welcomed with open arms, but I should say now that it’s actually in the interest of fintech firms.\n\nIn part because they exist in a business environment that is much more Silicon Valley than Wall Street, fintech firms, by and large, do not see themselves as banks. But many of them are, ultimately, financial institutions.\n\nBanks, by definition, are institutions that take deposits and make loans. While many fintech organizations see themselves as mere facilitators, if they are providing the essential functions of a banking institution, that poses questions about regulation. And if they’re subject to oversight, it’s better for them to understand what it takes to be compliant from the beginning.\n\n“Regulation” being the great bogeyman of the industry, I’d like to note that regulation is necessary for a functioning system. The trust that underpins the financial system is either earned or guaranteed by people or institutions. One of the ways of conferring that trust is the promise that mechanisms are in place to safeguard the system.\n\nFintech firms need that trust the same as any other bank or financial institution. This underlying expectation is why it’s best to get in early on regulation. It’s in these firms’ self-interest to provide a layer of trust-building that regulation can offer, particularly those that are getting to a scale where negative events could have major consequences.\n\nThis is especially true because most fintech firms today haven’t yet seen the down side of a credit cycle, and trust then will be shaken.\n\nAny student of economic history has to acknowledge that, like death and taxes, a down side to the cycle is inevitable. The aftermath of the cycle’s end will determine a lot of the character and contour of what sort of company can survive in this space. That alone should be cause for fintech to want some form of oversight.\n\nWhat fintech outfits don’t want is regulation that comes in after a crisis. That type of regulation almost always fights the last war, and that could mean tighter strictures and less room for innovation after the crash at the end of a credit cycle. Policymakers have too much experience with the old adage that history may not always repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\n\nSo, I think there are two things to focus on when talking about regulation: First, that it’s structured to protect both institutions and the public. Second, that we consider what regulation already looks like and where we think it’s headed.\n\nRegulation\n\nI have to stress that as a Federal Reserve Bank president, I have no hand in drafting regulations. So, forgive me if I veer into armchair quarterbacking.\n\nWhat I am able to do is talk more broadly about what’s been proposed, the examples we have to look at in other countries and regions, and what I think is likely to occur.\n\nThe European Union has given us some comparison for the proposed measures from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which remains the most comprehensive attempt at mapping out a strategy in the U.S. to date. In particular, a lot of commentary in the payments industry has drawn parallels between the European Commission’s Payment Services Directives and the OCC’s proposal to grant national bank charters to fintech companies.\n\nFintech firms vary widely in their business models: While some provide payments-related services, others offer loans to consumers and businesses, provide digital currencies, or offer financial planning or wealth management services.\n\nFor fintech firms whose business falls more on the payments end, there is some comparison to the European model. The Commission’s Directives ask that these types of firms be licensed and satisfy other general requirements. The closest analogy we have in the U.S. is state regulation and supervision of money-service businesses. Some fintech firms that fall under this umbrella are unhappy with the idea of having to obtain many, if not dozens, of licenses to operate around the country. The proposed OCC charter may offer them some relief.\n\nOn the other side, to the extent that the fintech firm is weighted toward making loans — especially to consumers — the Payment Services Directives don’t quite correlate. For that, the better comparison is the Commission’s Task Force on Financial Technology, which makes policy recommendations on fintech in financial services. It formally incorporates viewpoints from multiple regulatory bodies, not just banking regulators, which sets the European model apart from the OCC’s suggested framework.\n\nThere is an open question about whether or who should supervise fintech lenders in the United States, made all the more complicated by the interplay between our state and federal regulatory frameworks. Most personal finance companies, for example, are licensed and regulated at the state level. Uncertainty about the boundaries between these two competing spheres of authority can be seen in some states’ reactions to the OCC’s proposal.\n\nBut, particularly if we’re talking about loans to consumers, it’s only a matter of time until federal consumer protections will come into play.\n\nAll of which is to say, it’s complicated. But it continues to be, in my opinion, in the interest of fintech companies to be regulated.\n\nThis may sound like the particular nannying of a sometime regulator asking for more oversight. I’m not speculating at all that the Fed will be involved in fintech regulation. But I can say that none of us are trying to stifle innovation. If anything, you’ll hear us praise the ingenuity and imagination that comes from the technology sector. But there are risks, and we should be talking about them. Regulation can’t solve everything, and it can’t anticipate or guard against every problem. But it can try.\n\nFor me, regulation is not just a question of protecting consumers; it’s a question of protecting the innovators as well. It’s in their best interest to have an established framework in which to operate. In part because the trust it engenders will underpin their essential role in the financial system.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgain, this all comes back to trust and its critical role in the financial and economic systems. Whether it’s Eddie borrowing a 20 off of Joey at the corner bar, or the loan officer at our local community bank, we trust people to act in accordance with an agreed-upon code, both the legal one enshrined in legislation and the moral one we’ve entered into as a society. Whether it’s a structurally important financial institution or an app on our phone, we trust institutions to hold up their end of the bargain we struck when we deposited or borrowed funds. And whether it’s administered by multiple agencies or a single body, at the state or federal level, we trust that there is a safeguard in place to guide and protect the companies we’re entrusting with our economic livelihoods.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be in New Jersey.\n\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economy, talk about the implications for monetary policy, and explore some of the issues affecting the region, particularly workforce development.\n\nBefore I start, however, I should add the usual disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nWith that out of the way, the headline is that things are looking pretty good. Or, as I should say as a policy wonk, “The economy is displaying considerable strength.” GDP continued to grow in the third quarter at an even faster pace than in Q2. Third-quarter growth was recently revised up to 3.5 percent. That was driven largely by consumption.\n\nConsumer confidence is strong, retail sales are still solid — though slightly slower than previously anticipated — and equity markets are up.\n\nThe new orders index, though positive, fell slightly in December, though the regional business activity index increased sharply.\n\nAll in all, the snapshot is of a robust American economy.\n\nInflation\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In its simplest terms, that means that most people can find a job if they’re looking and inflation stays low and stable.\n\nStarting with inflation, we aim for an average of 2 percent. A little higher or a little lower from time to time is not something to worry about. We don’t need to be exactly at 2 percent all the time. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nPeople sometimes assume that the Fed worries more about inflation being too high than too low. But we give equal weight to distance from our goal, regardless of the direction. Over the past few years, inflation has been below target. That’s the main reason interest rates have been so low for so long. We’re starting to see some upward movement in the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE: It has increased to 1.7 percent, near our target.\n\nI know the joke is that Fed policymakers must not eat or drive because we prefer the core measure. But we’re looking for underlying trends, and stripping out those volatile components gives us a better read. That said, the yearly growth in the headline PCE index has also increased, rising to 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 0.3 percent a year earlier.\n\nAdditionally, inflation expectations are starting to rally around the 2 percent goal. One important facet of economics is that expectations can play a role in outcomes, particularly in inflation. It’s something of a monetary self-fulfilling prophecy. If markets believe inflation will remain low, it’s more likely to do so. And over the past few years, not everyone was on the same page with their predictions. But as expectations consolidate around our target rate, it makes it more likely that our target will become reality.\n\nLooking at all the information and the trends over the past few years, I see inflation on course to meet our target sometime this year or next.\n\nLabor Market\n\nOn the employment side of things, we’re doing very well. We had another month of solid gains in December, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs. That’s an average of 165,000 over the last quarter of 2016.\n\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent, which is at, or below what most economists believe is its natural rate of about 5 percent. The natural rate is the rate that we expect in a healthy economy.\n\nOf course, we don’t just look at the headline unemployment rate. And it should be noted that joblessness hits some portions of the population harder than others. For instance, the unemployment rate for African-American men was 8.6 percent in December, almost four percentage points higher than the average for the entire adult population.\n\nThere’s also a lot of talk about hidden pockets of unemployment, with particular concern that people may have dropped out of the labor market entirely, out of frustration. But even U6 unemployment has declined to 9.2 percent. While that’s still higher than headline unemployment, it’s worth noting that U6 peaked at about 17 percent during the worst of the recession and its aftermath.\n\nDemand for labor also remains strong and more people are quitting their jobs. That’s good news for the economy — it shows workers are more confident they can find another one — though I suppose some overworked HR managers might not be 100 percent thrilled about it.\n\nLayoffs also remain at all-time lows and job postings are near historical peaks. We continue to hear from our business contacts that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting progressively more difficult.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, it’s safe to call the U.S. labor market more or less at full health.\n\nOf course, that’s the economy as a whole. Things aren’t evenly distributed across this huge and diverse country. In New Jersey, unemployment is still slightly above the national average, at 5.0 percent. Job growth is lagging the country as a whole on an annualized basis, with New Jersey seeing 0.3 percent compared with the nation’s 1.7 percent. Labor force participation — which I’ll discuss in more detail in a moment — dropped steadily from April of 2016 to its current reading of 63.6 percent. That’s the lowest reading since 1983.\n\nOverall, New Jersey faces different issues than other states. The concentration of workers in uncompetitive industries has had a hand in slow job growth,1 and the large foreclosure inventory is restraining the housing market. The share of active loans in foreclosure is roughly three times larger than the country as a whole. We’ve made significant progress since 2013, but the share is still above prerecession readings, and we are faced with the simple math that when you’re hit harder, you have more ground to make up, and it takes longer to recover. House prices in New Jersey are growing below 3 percent, while the national average is 6. Add in the state budgetary pressures and the recent downgrade of the state credit rating, and the concerns of the people in this room look entirely different than those of other states’ bankers associations.\n\nThings are getting better, particularly in the past few months, but I point out the disparities between regions for two reasons.\n\nOne is that I get to praise the structure of the Federal Reserve System. I think it’s uniquely American to have a decentralized central bank — to have a structure that makes policy for a huge and incredibly varied economy, but takes into account the differences between regions. We know that the economic fortunes of Camden don’t look like those of Seattle. And when the FOMC comes together, the presidents of the 12 banks get to be a voice for their communities and businesses.\n\nI also mention it because I’m interested to hear your take on the employment situation in the area and the state. How are you faring? Something I’ve heard over and over again from businesses of all sizes is that they have the jobs; they just can’t find the people. There seems to be a skills void that can’t be filled by the existing workforce.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally. If we reconsider the way we are training people and further promote the occupations that require special skills, but not a traditional bachelor’s degree, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make postsecondary education “one-size-fits-all” when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\n\nThis is something that I think and talk a lot about. I’m a son of the District and an unapologetic cheerleader for it. I’m invested, not just as the president of the Philadelphia Fed, but as someone who sees the great potential of this region. I want to see us become a destination for business, and that means making the best use of our greatest resource: our people.\n\nI should be clear that I don’t have the power to change any policy or enact any law that can bring that kind of investment. But I can make the economic case to the people who do. We need to attract talent, train the people we have, and make the tristate area a top destination, in part by offering a world-class workforce.\n\nIt’s Peter Drucker 101: Play to your strengths. I always tell people that the best business advice I have is to make yourself invaluable. I’d offer the same advice to any city or region looking to become a business destination.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nI will also note that despite positive overall trends in the labor market, the participation rate is lower than I’d like.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a fairly basic calculation. It divides the workforce — those employed and those looking for work — by the population over the age of 16. That does not include people who’ve taken themselves out of the labor force.\n\nThe participation rate has been declining over the years and it plummeted in the aftermath of the crisis and recession, which is what we would expect. Recessions cause dips in the participation rate and it tends to rebound as the economy does.\n\nBut over the past six years, it hasn’t risen back up as much as we might have thought. We can point to a number of reasons to explain this, but later on I will talk about one trend that’s something of a mystery.\n\nA portion of the drop is that we simply can’t meet historical surges. In the 60s and 70s, as women entered the workforce in greater numbers, the rate swelled. But we no longer have a large, untapped portion of the population that can offer the same boost. So, we have to readjust expectations somewhat.\n\nAnother contributing factor is lifestyle fit: Fewer high school and college students are working while they’re in school, and some people have decided that they’re content to have single-income households.\n\nThen there is the big one: demographics. The initial wave of the large baby boom generation has started to retire. As the boomers exit the workforce, they’re not being replaced in the same numbers. Not to mention, we’re living longer, so the share of people on the retirement end is even larger. This is the overwhelming factor affecting participation, and I’ll return to it shortly.\n\nAnd then there is the mystery of the missing prime-aged males. This very unfairly named group consists of men aged 25 to 54. For reasons that we’re not quite sure of, their participation has been dropping. In 1954, it was 98 percent, compared with 88 percent today.2 This makes for one of the lowest participation rates for prime-age males among developed countries and one of the most rapid declines.\n\nAgain, the impact has not been felt evenly. Among prime-age African American men, the participation rate has fallen from 91 percent in 1972 — the oldest data available — to 80.3 percent today.\n\nThere are some troubling features of this decline among all men. The first is that dropping out seems to be a persistent state. The majority of men who report not working in any given month hadn’t worked in the previous year either. The second is that this demographic, when employed, adds to overall productivity, so the economy feels the loss when they are out of the workplace.\n\nI do want to reiterate that the group we’re talking about are men who are out of the labor force. For prime-age males in the workforce, the unemployment rate is low and the U.S. fares a lot better than our counterparts.\n\nAs I said, we don’t really know why this is happening to any degree of certainty. It could be that men participate in the workforce more intensively in their thirties and forties, so it’s reasonable to assume the ageing population is playing a role. But when we analyze the data, it turns out that nonparticipation goes up as the age goes down. That is, the younger the age group, the more likely they are to be out of the workforce. The data also show that participation rates follow educational attainment.\n\nThe consequences for this group’s lack of participation are severe, both for them and the economy. Around one-third of nonparticipants live below the federal poverty line. Most get by on government assistance or financial support from spouses or other family members.\n\nFor the rest of us a lower participation rate all around means lower productivity, which means lower growth.\n\nIt’s essential to have a robust workforce. Research by my staff indicates that, due to demographics and the retiring baby boomers, the low participation trend is unlikely to reverse. In fact, they project labor force participation could drop up to 2 percentage points further over the next five years.3 That’s from where we stand now at 62.7 percent.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this all mean for monetary policy? After December’s meeting, that makes a brisk average of one 25-basis-point hike per year for the last two years.\n\nBut I see three modest hikes as appropriate for the coming year, assuming the economy stays on track. Fed policymakers enjoy saying we’re data-dependent and this is an area where that rings especially true.\n\nI’ve said it before, and it’s worth repeating, that monetary policy is a fairly limited set of tools with a fairly limited reach. We will respond to changes in the economy with moves in the federal funds rate, and we can do a very good job of creating the conditions that are consistent with economic growth. But the kinds of policies that will deliver that growth — employment programs, development, taxation, and trade policies — are up to elected officials at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, things are looking good. The labor market is strong and we’re creating jobs at a good pace. The drop in labor force participation must be addressed, but that will take legislative action. Inflation is moving back up to our 2 percent goal and growth is solid. We’re starting 2017 off on a good foot.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Adam Scavette and Ethan Haswell, “Is Urban Cool Cooling New Jersey’s Job Market?” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Research Brief, December 1, 2016.\n\n[2]Council of Economic Advisors. “The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation,” June 2014.\n\n[3]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Research Rap Special Report, February 6, 2014.",

            "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nI’m going to keep my introductory remarks short, so we can get to the conversation more quickly. I’m following Ben Franklin’s advice that: “Silence is not always a sign of wisdom, but babbling is ever a mark of folly.”\n\nI think it’s probably wise to start with an explanation of why I’m even here. Why is this policy wonk, who raises and lowers interest rates, interested in inequality and prosperity?\n\nThe Federal Reserve actually has a strong interest in the subject. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which among other things, requires banks to meet the credit needs of all communities, including those of lower income. Originally, the Fed got involved to help banks fulfill their CRA requirements, and we still do. But our role has also evolved to be a primary conduit and convener for community organizations and the funders that can help. That’s everything from community investment funds to some of the world’s largest financial institutions. We don’t fund projects or organizations ourselves, but we do conduct research and help foster best practices.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, the Federal Reserve System is divided into 12 regional banks around the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. Each District bank is independent and operates as a representative and reporter of economic issues in their region. The Philadelphia Fed District consists of Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Delaware.\n\nEach of the 12 regional banks has a community development and outreach function, and each does exceptional work. Obviously, I’m biased towards our bank, and I see Philadelphia as having a unique position and ability to conduct research and find real, sustainable solutions for some of our most intractable problems.\n\nThe other banks oversee bigger Districts — San Francisco has the nine western states and covers more than 20 percent of the country — but the Third District offers a microcosm of the issues and economics we see around much of the country: We have urban, rural, and postindustrial areas. We have small businesses and huge multinationals. We have industries using the cutting edge of technology and traditional manufacturing. In short, we have a perfect laboratory to study the way programs aimed at economic mobility and self-sufficiency work.\n\nI’ll give you an example. The unemployment rate for Pennsylvania is higher than the national average. But when I talk to employers and business owners, they say they can’t find qualified applicants. There are people out there who want jobs and employers who have them; the gap is in skills.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income, but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nWe can help a lot of workers and a lot of businesses by emphasizing training and skills and looking at practical ways to get people into not just jobs, but careers. I recently went with my team to Roxborough High School, which is involved with the Philadelphia Academies project. Students at the Academies study a core discipline — the ones I talked to were concentrating on everything from international entrepreneurship to biotech — and will come out of high school ready to enter a profession, if they choose. Some may stay in that career for a long time, some will go on to do a conventional bachelor’s degree, and some will get more technical training. But all of them will have the skills to find a path that leads them to a prosperous life.\n\nThis is just one example of the kind of work my team is studying and the research they’re undertaking. They also are examining everything from healthy communities to housing to consumer credit. It’s a big job and the Third District has a lot to contend with. In 2004, only six of the 60 counties had poverty rates higher than the national average. By 2014, that number had risen to 11.\n\nFrom a monetary policymaker’s perspective, the issues of poverty and economic mobility are obviously important. We tend to speak of the economy as a whole, using a broad brush to paint a sweeping portrait of America. And that’s important. But the national economy is made up of a myriad of other economies — state, local, and community microeconomies. Each is like a single brushstroke. Each microeconomy has its own cause and effect and contributes to the overall picture. No one of them operates in isolation, and we should all remember that our neighbors’ economic fortunes are tied to our own. Studies in community development add depth and contour to what we see.\n\nI’ve always gone with the business mantra of “play to your strengths.” So, I look at the strengths of the District and the strengths of the Philadelphia Fed and see a way to make real change happen.\n\nI truly believe that this District can be an innovation lab. We have the demographics, the economic profile, and most importantly, extraordinary people with a strong sense of community. The Fed has world-class research talent and exceptional partners in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. Programs and solutions we find here can be adopted and adapted for towns and cities across the country.\n\nI know that’s a big challenge, but you can’t succeed if you don’t try, right?\n\nEconomic mobility happens when people have a level playing field. That’s what community development work fundamentally does: It tries to put everyone at the same point on the starting line and ensure each person has access to opportunity.\n\nWe know there is a cycle of poverty, and that poverty in one generation disproportionately leads to poverty in the next. It is a systemic hurdle to success. Raj Chetty, a leading economics professor, now at Stanford, is the go-to guy for this area of research. He and his coauthors found that where a child grows up has an effect on his or her upward mobility later in life. The likelihood of a child born into the bottom fifth of the income distribution reaching the top fifth varies markedly across the United States, from a low of 4.4 percent in Charlotte, NC, to a high of 12.9 percent in San Jose, CA. Philadelphia falls in between at 7.4 percent. The San Jose odds are much better than either Charlotte or Philadelphia; but they’re still lower than we should accept.1\n\nEven here in our metro region, the data continue to illustrate inequality across geography. A child who is raised in a low-income family in Bucks County will make over $4,000 more at age 26 than a child in a similar family in Philadelphia County.2\n\nI’ve talked a lot about the pragmatic reasons behind the importance of this work. But I’d also add that this is a moral imperative. We’re honoring Benjamin Franklin today, and that naturally evokes the philosophy and essence of what it means to be American. This is a country, perhaps more than any other, whose fundamental ethos is that anyone can be anything they want if they work hard. Ben Franklin himself is a testament to this. He left school at 10 to work full-time in his father’s candle shop, yet went on to become one of our most revered founding fathers.\n\nFranklin saw the value of helping people and places in the future. In his will, he left trusts to Boston and Philadelphia that were intentionally invested in 100- and 200-year periods, so the interest could compound. The money was then used to fund apprenticeship programs and civic projects in each city, as Franklin’s will directed. Even today, Franklin’s legacy funds scholarships, helping students to move up the economic ladder.\n\nAt the heart of this push for economic mobility is the quintessentially American belief that everyone should have an equal chance at success. It is the soul of democracy and the foundation of any fair society.\n\nThere isn’t one single barrier to moving up the economic ladder, and those barriers don’t come from a single source. There are multiple, tangled factors — education, training, affordable housing, child care, even basics like transportation. If you can’t get to work, you can’t work. Finding solutions to those problems takes a lot of sharp minds and hard work, and I think we can get there.\n\nMaybe someone as extraordinary as Ben Franklin would’ve succeeded anyway, if he’d been born today, despite having to leave school at such a young age. But what if the structural barriers wound up being too much? The next Ben Franklin could be out there, but barriers are preventing him — or her — from succeeding. And wouldn’t we all be worse off for that?\n\nOur aim at the Philadelphia Fed is to make sure economic growth is inclusive and that every person has access to the tools needed to achieve his or her fullest potential. We want to use our research and our convening abilities to find solutions that can be applied across the Third District and the country. To quote Ben again: “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Chetty, Raj, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez. “Where Is the Land of Opportunity?

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning; it’s a pleasure to be here. This is my first public speech since we raised rates in December as well as my first as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I’m trying not to take it personally that people seem to find my opinions much more interesting nowadays.\n\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economy, talk about the implications for monetary policy, and explore some of the issues affecting the region — particularly workforce development.\n\nBefore I start, however, I should add the usual disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe headline is that things are looking pretty good, or as I should say as a policy wonk: “The economy is displaying considerable strength.” Gross Domestic Product continued to grow in the third quarter at an even faster pace than in Q2. Third-quarter growth was recently revised up to 3.5 percent. That was driven largely by consumption.\n\nConsumer confidence is strong, retail sales are still solid — though slightly slower than previously anticipated — and equity markets are up.\n\nThe New Orders Index, though positive, fell slightly in December, though the Regional Business Activity Index increased sharply.\n\nAll in all, the snapshot is of a robust American economy.\n\nInflation\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In its simplest terms, that means that most people can find a job if they’re looking, and inflation stays low and stable.\n\nStarting with inflation, we aim for an average of 2 percent. A little higher or a little lower from time to time is not something to worry about. We don’t need to be exactly at 2 percent all the time. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nPeople sometimes assume that the Fed worries more about inflation being too high than too low. But we give equal weight to the distance from our goal regardless of the direction. Over the past few years, inflation has been below target. That’s the main reason interest rates have been so low for so long. We’re starting to see some upward movement in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy. This is a long name for the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Most economists simply call it “the core PCE,” and it has increased to 1.7 percent, near our target.\n\nI know the joke is that Fed policymakers must not eat or drive, because we prefer the core measure. But we’re looking for underlying trends and stripping out those volatile components gives us a better read. That said, the yearly growth in the headline PCE index has also increased, rising to 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 0.3 percent a year earlier.\n\nAdditionally, inflation expectations are starting to rally around the 2 percent goal. One important facet of economics is that expectations can play a role in outcomes, particularly in inflation. It’s something of a monetary self-fulfilling prophecy. If markets believe inflation will remain low, it’s more likely to do so. And over the past few years, not everyone was on the same page with their predictions. But as expectations consolidate around our target rate, it makes it more likely that our target will become reality.\n\nLooking at all the information and the trends over the past few years, I see inflation on course to meet our target sometime this year or next.\n\nLabor market\n\nOn the employment side of things, we’re doing very well. We had another month of solid gains in December, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs. That’s an average of 165,000 over the last quarter of 2016.\n\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent, which is at, or below what most economists believe is its natural rate of about 5 percent. The natural rate is the rate that we expect in a healthy economy. Unemployment is never zero, because people will always move from job to job, and we add new people to the workforce every day.\n\nOf course, we don’t just look at the headline unemployment rate. And it should be noted that joblessness hits some portions of the population worse than other demographics. For instance, the unemployment rate for African-American males was 8.6 percent in December, almost four percentage points higher than the average for the entire adult population.\n\nThere’s also a lot of talk about hidden pockets of unemployment, with particular concern that people may have dropped out of the labor market entirely, out of frustration. But even the broadest measure of unemployment has declined. That’s the U6 measure, which takes into account people who aren’t currently looking for a job but say they want one and people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time. That rate has dropped to 9.2 percent. While that’s still higher than headline unemployment, it’s worth noting that U6 peaked at about 17 percent during the worst of the recession and its aftermath.\n\nDemand for labor also remains strong and more people are quitting their jobs. That’s good news for the economy — it shows workers are more confident they can find another one — though I suppose some overworked HR managers might not be 100 percent thrilled about it.\n\nLayoffs also remain at all-time lows and job postings are near historical peaks. We continue to hear from our business contacts that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting progressively more difficult.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, it’s safe to call the U.S. labor market more or less at full health.\n\nYou’ll note my previous remarks referred to the economy as a whole. Things aren’t evenly distributed across this huge and diverse country. We’re in Pennsylvania and things are different here. The state’s unemployment rate has been higher than the national average, though it finally edged down in November, from 5.8 percent in October to 5.7 percent. That’s the first decrease since January of last year.\n\nEmployment growth has been slower as well: While the country has experienced a rate of 1.7 percent in job growth, we’ve seen a rate of just 0.6 percent.\n\nI point this out in part because this is when I get to praise the structure of the Federal Reserve System. I think it’s uniquely American to have a decentralized central bank. To have a structure that makes policy for a huge and incredibly varied economy, but takes into account the differences between regions. We know that the economic fortunes of Camden don’t look like those of Seattle. And when the FOMC comes together, the presidents of the 12 banks get to be a voice for their communities and businesses.\n\nI also mention it because I’m interested to hear your take on the employment situation in the area and the state.

I always tell people that the best business advice I have is: Make yourself invaluable. I’d offer the same advice to any city or region looking to become a business destination.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nI will also note that despite positive overall trends in the labor market, the participation rate is lower than I’d like.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a fairly basic calculation. It divides the workforce — those employed plus those looking for work — by the population over the age of 16.

Not to mention, we’re living longer, so the share of people on the retirement end is even larger. This is the overwhelming factor affecting participation, and I’ll return to it shortly.\n\nFirst, however, the mystery of the missing prime-aged males: This very unfairly named group consists of men aged 25 to 54. For reasons that we’re not quite sure of, their participation has been dropping. In 1954, the rate for all males was 98 percent, compared to 88 percent today.1 This makes for one of the lowest participation rates for prime-age males among developed countries, and one of the most rapid declines.\n\nAgain, the impact has not been felt evenly. Among prime-age African-American men, the participation rate has fallen from 91 percent in 1972 — the oldest data available — to 80.3 percent today.\n\nThere are some troubling features of this decline among all men.

The data also show that participation rates follow educational attainment.\n\nThe consequences for this group’s lack of participation are severe, both for them and the economy. Around one-third of nonparticipants live below the federal poverty line. Most get by on government assistance or financial support from spouses or other family members.\n\nFor the rest of us, a lower participation rate all-around means lower productivity, which means lower growth.\n\nIt’s essential to have a robust workforce. Research by my staff shows that, due to demographics and the retiring baby boomers, they don’t think the low participation trend will reverse. In fact, they project labor force participation could drop up to 2 percentage points further over the next five years.2 That’s from where we stand now at 62.7 percent.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this all mean for monetary policy? After December’s meeting, that makes a brisk average of one 25-basis-point hike per year for the last two years. But I see three modest hikes as appropriate for the coming year, assuming the economy stays on track. Fed policymakers enjoy saying we’re data-dependent and this is an area where that rings especially true.\n\nI’ve said it before, and it’s worth repeating, that monetary policy is a fairly limited set of tools with a fairly limited reach. We will respond to changes in the economy with moves in the federal funds rate, and we can do a very good job of creating the conditions that are consistent with economic growth. But the kinds of policies that will deliver that growth — employment programs, development, taxation, and trade policy — is up to elected officials at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, things are looking good. The labor market is strong and we’re creating jobs at a good pace. The drop in labor force participation must be addressed, but that will take legislative action. Inflation is moving back up to our 2 percent goal, and growth is solid. We’re starting 2017 off on a good foot.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Council of Economic Advisors, June 2014. “The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation,” June 2014, available at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov.pdf  (last accessed January 9, 2017).\n\n[2]Fujita, Shigeru. “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014). https://philadelphiafedcm.ws.frb.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/research-rap/2014/on-the-causes-of-declines-in-the-labor-force-participation-rate.pdf?la=en.",

            "content": "Good evening. It’s a pleasure to be here at the Athenaeum of Philadelphia.\n\nGiven the excitement of the past few weeks, I’m going to take the opportunity this evening to be a little boring. I’m not going to discuss my outlook or the next rate hike, although I fully expect to be asked about them. Instead, I’m going to take a step back and talk a bit about how the Fed came to be and what it is we do, and what it is we don’t do. We’re in the birthplace of American central banking this evening, and I like to take every opportunity to talk about this great District, headquartered in this historic, wonderful city.\n\nEven though I’ll mostly be addressing the whys and wherefores of the Fed System, I should still deliver the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, let me start, as they say, at the beginning.\n\nA Brief History of Central Banking\n\nThe First Bank of the United States was the brainchild of Alexander Hamilton and located right here in Philadelphia when we were still the capital of the country. The bank was established in 1791 to deal with the debt from the Revolutionary War and to ensure the government’s financial stability. It looked a lot different than the entity we are today, and it wasn’t without controversy. As Broadway has reminded us — at least as it has reminded those who can get tickets — Thomas Jefferson was among those who worried about power that was too strong and too centralized. He even once famously said he found banks to be more dangerous than standing armies.1 When the bank’s charter was up for renewal after its initial 20 years, the measure failed by a vote each in the House and the Senate, and it was dissolved.\n\nFive years later, Congress agreed to a central banking function a second time, and we got the imaginatively named Second Bank of the United States. And 20 years after that, Congress again decided not to renew the charter, again owing to a strain of popular sentiment that didn’t trust powerful, centralized institutions.\n\nThis makes reasonable sense given many of the founders’ philosophical foundations. But it was nowhere near unanimous, and the problem with not having a central bank is that it breeds volatility. The period leading up to the third iteration of American central banking — the Federal Reserve — was marked by currency instability, bank runs, and cycles of boom and bust. At one point, J.P. Morgan actually had to step in to personally bail out the country. Even during the Revolutionary War era, central banking was standard in a democracy, and it remains that way today. Certainly there are no developed economies that don’t have it in some form. So, the eventual adoption of our current central bank — in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act — was to some extent inevitable. And the configuration of the Federal Reserve System — a central bank with a decentralized structure — is something of a testament to old-fashioned American compromise.2 It also reflects the unique demands of the United States and our economy.\n\nHow the Fed Is Organized\n\nThe Federal Reserve System consists of a Board of Governors, which sits in Washington, D.C., and 12 regional Banks located around the country. The Board seats seven governors, including the Chair. Each regional Bank has its own president and board of directors, which is made up of business, banking, and community leaders from the area. Fundamentally, this provides the Fed with a perspective, within each District, of the sectors and issues that make the region tick.\n\nThis is an important aspect of the Fed that most other countries don’t have. We’re making national policy, but we’re doing it for an enormous country, and the averages of economic data can obscure realities on the ground. Conditions look very different in Philadelphia or Camden than they do in Dallas or Salt Lake City. This system gives, in my view, a voice to a range of localities and sectors. It also allows us to focus on regional issues within each Bank’s District.\n\nThe United States has a unique set of needs. It’s easy to forget that we’re an outlier because we’re such a massive country: Only Russia and Canada are bigger geographically, only China and India have larger populations, and no one country has a bigger economy. And that economy is vast, spreading across sectors and natural resources in a way that most other nations’ just don’t.\n\nSo, it makes sense that we have a system that feeds back information from around the country.\n\nThe other difference from most central banks is that the Fed has a dual mandate rather than a single goal; that is, we’re charged with both maximum employment and price stability. Most just focus on one.\n\n“Maximum employment” encompasses a wide range of metrics, although the most attention is paid to the unemployment rate. That number, of course, will never be zero. Instead, we try to ensure that labor markets are functioning dynamically and efficiently. Associated with that goal is a fairly low unemployment level that economists term the “natural rate.” Estimates vary, but most of us put it more or less at 5 percent. At 4.9 percent, that number is currently right on target, although I stress again that we do look at a variety of criteria to tell us the full shape and health of the labor market.\n\n“Price stability” is, of course, low and stable inflation. That doesn’t always mean working to keep inflation from taking off; for the past several years, in fact, inflation has been stubbornly low. For those of us who remember the ’70s and ’80s, the goal of increasing inflation seems completely at odds with what we were taught to want. But our goal at the moment is 2 percent, and we’re still running low.\n\nIt’s important to outline these goals because the decisions we make within the Fed — the way we look at the economy and respond to data — are built entirely on the foundation of our dual mandate.\n\nNow that we’ve established that, I turn to the question so many people secretly want to ask: What, exactly, does the Fed do? I’m delighted to talk about it, but just as important, I’ll also mention what we don’t do.\n\nI want to stop for a moment because I know that might sound a bit loaded. Perhaps I’m doubting whether most people can pass a Fed exam. But I find that a lot of what we do can be overlooked or misunderstood. I have literally had Ph.D. economists ask me why we didn’t make loans to community organizations after the financial crisis, which, for the record, we are in no way authorized to do. And people often ask what we’re doing about the deficit. Not to mention there is an avalanche of misinformation out there, and the Fed, as an organization, hasn’t always been good at correcting it. In the absence of a rebuttal, the myth will take hold. Or, to borrow a famous maxim: A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth can get its pants on.\n\nNot to mention, it occurs to me that the average American has much better things to do than memorize the intricacies of Fed mechanisms.\n\nSo, I hope you’ll indulge me in an overview of the Fed and allow me to puncture a myth or two along the way.\n\nWhat Does the Fed Do?\n\nFirst off, the overview: The Fed sets monetary policy. We also regulate banks, along with an alphabet soup of government agencies. We’re famously the lender of last resort in times of crisis. And the lede that always gets buried — and I wish it weren’t so overshadowed by discussions of interest rates — is that we work within our Districts to help strengthen local communities’ economies. We have a truly exceptional team in Philadelphia, and they work with partners all over the Third District, which I could tell you about all day, but first, the broccoli: monetary policy.\n\nMonetary policy is a fairly limited field with a fairly limited set of tools. A lot of the questions I’m asked, as a Fed president, are about aspects of the American economy that affect our work but that we don’t actually have any control over. Fiscal policy, for instance, which deals with debts, deficits, and taxes. Or investments to encourage growth. Or programs to spur job creation. Those all depend on elected officials, be they on the local, state, or national level.\n\nOur job is to create the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive, but we’re essentially tilling the land. Sowing the seeds and tending the crops are the province of legislative action.\n\nMonetary policy is about meeting our two goals — price stability and maximum employment — mostly by moving interest rates. There are other tools we use, and I’ll get to those shortly, but in normal times, it’s mostly about moving what is technically called the federal funds rate.\n\nWe set rates, as most of you know, when the Federal Open Market Committee — the FOMC — meets in Washington, which we do eight times a year. Regional Bank presidents don’t always get to vote. Most of us rotate into a voting position every three years, but the governors always do, as does the president of the New York Fed. New York, owing to the presence of Wall Street, enjoys something of a “first among equals” status within the system. And while the rest of us don’t always vote, we do always represent our Districts and play a part in the discussion.\n\nIs the Fed Politically Driven?\n\nThat discussion, to address myth number one, is never political. Because we’re appointed policymakers, we don’t respond to swings in public opinion or election cycles. Unlike politicians, who suffer the slings and arrows of the 24-hour news machine, we operate in a rare, apolitical bubble, which, I should stress, is very much in the public interest because our policy actions aren’t going to take effect for at least a couple of years.3 The independence of the Fed is crucial to making the best decisions possible for the American economy, free from the pressures of politics.\n\nThe somewhat sad truth about the FOMC is that, unless you really love policy discussions, it’s not exactly a party. It is literally just a room full of policy wonks talking through data and metrics and economic theory. There’s no political discussion, no dramatic oratory; there’s definitely no Hamilton-inspired rap battles. We’re plodding and methodical and circumspect. We’re just looking to put the best policy in place.\n\nIs the Fed Audited?\n\nAlthough we’re independent, that doesn’t mean we’re unchecked. The Fed is what’s considered “independent within government.” We’re overseen by Congress, but neither they nor the presidential administration have a say in the decisions we make.\n\nThis is where one of the most prevalent recent myths about the Fed originates, that being the idea that the Fed is not audited. Most people, when they hear the word “audit,” think of a financial audit. And, in that respect, we are altogether transparent. We are financially examined by both governmental agencies and independent auditors from the private sector. Our balance sheet is published weekly, and we produce an annual report of each Bank’s financial statements as well as one for the Board of Governors.\n\nRecent calls to “audit the Fed” are actually about assessing our policy decisions, not our financial ones. But this goes back to the critical independence that Congress mandated. If the Fed were open to interference by elected officials, that pressure could result in short-termism and encourage hasty decisions to please political ends, rather than economic ones. And, in fact, the Chair testifies to Congress at least twice a year, often more, as do many Fed officials. The Fed minutes are published, the Chair holds a press conference every other meeting, and we all speak publicly about our own views on policy decisions.\n\nDoes the Fed Print Money?\n\nThose decisions, as I said, are mostly about moving the federal funds rate, our primary monetary policy tool. As I also said, the FOMC is generally a pretty milquetoast affair. In extreme times, however, like the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the Fed turns to what’s called “unconventional” policy. The most well known of them is quantitative easing, or QE, and it plays a role in the last myth I want to address, which is that the Fed prints money.\n\nThe Fed does issue money under its authority, but the Treasury’s Bureau of Printing and Engraving does the actual printing. If you look at a bill — in newer ones, it’s on the upper left — you’ll see a letter and a number: B2, L12, F6. Those tell you which regional Fed Bank issued that bill. We’re C3:  the Third District, with the corresponding third letter of the alphabet.\n\nThat feeds into part of the misconception, which is a fairly pedantic distinction to make. But the bigger issue is the perception that the Fed prints money with abandon and could flood the market with cash at any point, destabilizing the economy.\n\nThat’s the part I want to address because it can sound incredibly concerning stripped of detail.\n\nFirst things first: The Federal Reserve is essentially the banks’ bank. We want to ensure that institutions can cover their debts, so banks are required to hold a certain level of funds with us. The federal funds rate is the interest rate on loans that banks make to each other overnight. That rate tends to influence interest rates more broadly so the effect ripples through the economy. Low rates encourage economic activity, which spurs job growth, which is why we keep rates low during times of economic crisis. When economic activity ramps up, we increase rates to keep inflation under control.\n\nThe reason rates have been so low for so long — they were essentially at zero for close to eight years — was to help the economy make it through the recovery.\n\nOf course, that’s not always sufficient, as we found after the financial crisis. In those instances when standard policy can’t move us around the bases, we have to play with a bigger bat. That’s why the Fed turned to QE, which is what was casually called “printing money,” a term that’s not quite accurate.\n\nQE was a round of programs of large-scale asset purchases. The Fed bought assets from the banks that hold accounts with us, which came in the form of long-term Treasury- and mortgage-backed securities. The so-called printing of money was the way we paid for them: The Fed credited money to the banks’ accounts, money that had not been printed and technically didn’t exist before we pressed the metaphorical “Enter” key.\n\nSo, in that sense, the money was created. But it wasn’t printed, and that’s part of the issue. The system wasn’t flooded with physical dollars; it was an electronic credit on a transaction sheet so banks could lend more money. And the total amount of assets in the economy did not change because each transaction was an exchange of one asset for another — a bond for a reserve, for instance.\n\nThe “why” of this is that the fed funds rate focuses primarily on short-term interest rates. QE helped keep longer-term rates low as well, which encourages individuals to take out loans and spend on bigger items, like homes or cars, and businesses to invest in expanding. That stimulates economic activity and encourages job growth. Lower rates also drive more money into the stock market, which doesn’t sound great to a lot of people. It sounds like Wall Street getting a bonus, right? But a lot of pension funds and other investments made by Americans at all points on the wealth scale are tied to the markets, so this benefits Main Street as well.\n\nQE is in the past at this point, so why do I bring it up?\n\nI do it for the same reason I think it’s important to continue to explain, as well as we can, what the Fed is doing. It wasn’t clear to a lot of people what was happening when it was underway, and misunderstanding can breed mistrust. We operate on the good faith of the American people, and it’s important that we be as clear as we can be about the steps we’re taking to protect our economy. And it’s an economy we all live and work in; it’s an economy we’re steering for our families as well as yours, so we all have skin in the game.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s been 225 years since the First Bank of the United States was established, and some of the function of its eventual incarnation remains as mysterious today as the founders’ penchant for wigs. What we can learn from history, both recent and far gone, is how to better communicate and ensure our constituents understand what we’re doing and why.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]A letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Taylor in May 1816, https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/private-banks-quotation\n\n[2]For more information on the Federal Reserve’s history, see the History of the Federal Reserve https://www.federalreserveeducation.org/about-the-fed/history.\n\n[3]Tomas Havranek and Marek Rusnak, “Transmission Lags of Monetary Policy: A Meta-Analysis,” International Journal of Central Banking, 9:4 (December 2013), pp. 39–75. http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb13q4a2.htm.",

            "content": "Good morning, it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nI’m Pat Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and a lot of people have no idea what that means.\n\nI’m sure most of you do, or you likely wouldn’t be here. But if you’ll bear with me, I’m going to spend the first couple of minutes today on a brief overview of the Federal Reserve System and the role we play in the economy. The Fed has been the subject of a lot of talk and debate lately, so it seems like a good time to revisit the basics.\n\nSince I’m wading into the subject of public commentary, I should deliver the standard Fed disclaimer now: I’m speaking for myself today, and my views do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed: An Overview\n\nThe Fed has been criticized in the past for the quality of our communication. Some of this criticism is about the way we signal our intentions about policy, but some of it is really about the fact that we can’t seem to speak in sentences shorter than 70 words. And we’re fond of terms like “downward nominal wage rigidity,” which don’t do much to capture the public’s attention.\n\nSo, I’d like to speak to you plainly, I hope, and directly about what the Fed is doing and the current economic conditions. I’ll talk in more detail about some of the issues that are at the forefront of the national conversation. And I’ll address some of the factors that can help change the trajectory of the economy.\n\nFirst off, the overview. There are 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks around the country, each of which has a president, and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. We all meet every six weeks or so in D.C. for the FOMC, the Federal Open Market Committee, to make a decision about what we’re going to do ― or not do ― about monetary policy. The 12 presidents don’t always have a vote ― although New York always does, as do the governors ― but we all participate in the discussion. The structure of the Fed is different than most nations’ central banks, which is beneficial for a country so vast and varied.\n\nI find two things particularly important about this structure. First, it gives voice to communities and industries all over the country, so we’re not making policy through the lens of one myopic view. We’re the world’s third largest country, both by geographical size and by population, with a wide-ranging economy, and that’s a lot to cover. The economy is very different in Seattle than it is in Camden, and it’s important that we assess conditions on a District level as well as a macro one. Second is that it adds a richness of perspective to the discussion because we all have different backgrounds, different ways of looking at the data, and different methods by which we judge economic outcomes. It helps to avoid groupthink.\n\nDespite meeting in the most politically charged place in the country, politics actually never plays a role. The FOMC is just a bunch of policy wonks analyzing data so we can make the best decisions for the American economy.\n\nThose decisions focus on achieving our two goals, which were set for us by Congress: maximum employment and price stability. When Fed officials and talking heads discuss the Fed’s “dual mandate,” that’s what they’re referring to here. The Fed is also rare among the world’s central banks for having two goals; most just have a single focus.\n\nIt’s not really the technical definition, but we think of maximum employment as more or less that the job market in the United States is good enough that you can find a job if you’re looking.\n\nPrice stability is low and steady inflation.\n\nNeither of the numbers associated with these goals is zero. The Fed has an inflation target rate of 2 percent; that is, we want prices to rise on average about 2 percent in the medium term. That should allow the economy to grow without devaluing your paycheck.\n\nThe labor market is measured in a variety of ways, but the number most frequently cited is the unemployment rate. Economists have an estimate of what’s called the “natural rate” of unemployment, which is basically the rate we expect in a healthy economy. Currently, most people put it somewhere around 5 percent. It’s not zero because the unemployment rate tracks people who are actively looking for jobs. So, when people graduate from school, for instance, or return to the workforce after taking time off to raise children, they’re counted as unemployed while they search. And people get laid off and quit jobs all the time, so they’re counted, too.\n\nLabor Force Participation in Greater Detail\n\nThis gets me to the first issue that’s receiving a lot of interest. You all know that we don’t just determine the health of the labor market by one metric. You’ve probably heard a lot about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate lately. And I want to address that.\n\nWe are always circumspect when we look at these numbers because finding the pulse of the American workforce is important; it’s not something we, as policymakers, are looking to dress up or obfuscate. Our goal is maximum employment, and we want to be sure we’re achieving it. We’re not affected by election cycles or influenced by politics, and that independence means we can focus on finding the best solutions possible.\n\nThere are many ways to look at the data, and they tell us different things. The unemployment rate I just referred to ― technically called U3 unemployment ― is currently at 5.0 percent, right about the natural rate. Despite frequent talk about a sub-par economy, we’re actually doing pretty well. It’s important to remember that during the worst of the recession, unemployment hit a 10 percent high.\n\nThe U6 measure ― which takes U3 and adds people who are working part time but would like to be full time as well as people who say they want a job but have stopped looking ― is higher, at 9.7 percent. That’s higher than we might expect but not drastically so.\n\nThen there is the labor force participation rate, which has been the focus of a lot of recent discussion and debate.\n\nThe labor force participation rate looks at the number of people working in the U.S. as a proportion of the working-age population, which seems logical. But it is a very basic calculation, and the specifics might surprise you.\n\nWe define working age as everyone over the age of 16. That’s a lot of people, and many of them aren’t working for reasons that have nothing to do with the job market. My mother is part of that equation, even though no one would expect her to still be punching a timecard at her age. The high school and college students in the audience today are also counted, even though a lot of you aren’t working because you’re focused on your studies.\n\nBut there has been a lot of concern over the decline in participation. In particular, concern over the driving forces.\n\nForces Behind the Declining Participation Rate\n\nLabor force participation can be affected by both “cyclical” and “structural” issues. That is, the rate can reflect the overall economy and its ups and downs ― the cycle of the economy ― or perhaps something that has shifted fundamentally in the structure of the labor market.\n\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis and subsequent recession, labor force participation plummeted as people were laid off and couldn’t find new work. That’s the unfortunate normal for recessions, which is worse in one as deep as the one we experienced. The deeper the recession, the longer it takes for people to find jobs, and a lot of them give up looking altogether. This time was no exception.\n\nWe hope and expect that those people will start job hunting again, once the economy picks back up. That’s what would normally happen as a recovery continues its progress. But over the past six years, that hasn’t happened to the extent we might have predicted. This raises the possibility of underlying issues or a hidden segment of the unemployed that we’re not accounting for ― people who are still on the sidelines who might at some point rejoin the workforce.\n\nResearch by my staff shows that’s not the case. They’ve found that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\n\nThe most influential impact is coming from the first wave of baby boomers starting to retire. This generation will be the biggest group of older Americans in our nation’s history, which is going to have an obvious impact on the percentage of people working.\n\nThere’s also the simple fact that we’re living longer, so there are just more people in the mix, which I think is something to be celebrated, personally.\n\nThere are other contributory factors: We’ve seen a record number of high school graduates in the U.S., and college attendance rates are, on average, rising as well. That’s delaying some people from entering the workforce, and many students are foregoing work while they’re studying.\n\nAdditionally, there seems to be a shift in views on work-life balance, with more people deciding a one-income household is worth the tradeoff. For some people, it’s a matter of leisure time or the preference to have one stay-at-home parent; there’s any number of reasons.\n\nAll of those factors affect the very basic equation of labor force participation, and they should be taken into account.\n\nBut we also have to look at historical precedent and whether we’re measuring by the right yardstick. Part of the reason the labor force participation rate rose so dramatically in the past was also due to demographics. The post-World War II period was marked first by the baby boom and its attendant influx of workers to the economy. And it also saw the rapid entrance of women into the workforce. Female participation rates increased from less than 35 percent to around 60 percent in this period. That wave of people joining the workforce made a huge difference to participation.\n\nBut we’re no longer in a situation that will allow for a similar boost or a similar rate. There’s no large portion of society that’s left out. There’s no one group whose entry to the market will have that significant an effect. And the population is growing more slowly, meaning we won’t see the kind of boost the baby boom gave us either.\n\nAfter accounting for all those factors, the lower rate of labor force participation is understandable. And in the case of people living longer and enjoying their retirement or more people able to make choices that fit their life preferences, it’s a positive.\n\nBut the effects of the drop in the participation rate are something we need to look at here. Because the vast majority of the decline is the result of the baby boomers’ retirement onset, my staff doesn’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate will drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.\n\nIf the low participation rate doesn’t reflect a portion of the population that still wants, but can’t get, work, does this matter?\n\nThe answer is yes. Or YES.\n\nSome Consequences of the Declining Labor Force Participation Rate\n\nIt matters because labor force participation affects growth. We can see that by studying the U.S. economy during the recovery. After bottoming out in mid-2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the subsequent six years. That’s very slow for a recovery; it’s even slow by historical averages. To put that in context, growth averaged 3.5 percent in the second half of the 20th century ― of which 1.7 percent came from the expansion of the American workforce. By contrast, the labor force has only grown by 0.5 percent over the recovery, less than half the historical average.\n\nWith all those people in retirement and with people living longer, there are more economic pressures to contend with. We need a labor force that can help meet that challenge.\n\nThe consequence of a declining participation rate means that output will shrink. That is, with fewer workers, the United States will produce less. When we produce less, growth stalls.\n\nThen there are the demographic shifts: The changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in mid-career workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.2\n\nWe therefore have a workforce that is less productive than it used to be with the pressure of caring for a retiring segment of the population that is bigger than it’s ever been before. There will be a strain on Medicare and Social Security, leaving fewer resources for the country to spend on other areas ― for instance, maintaining our competitive global edge.\n\nUltimately, places with a high participation rate are more successful, healthier economies. If that is the case, and we’ve all but tapped our resources, can anything be done?\n\nAgain, the answer is yes.\n\nAn Alternative Policy Measure: Immigration\n\nPart of the Fed primer is that we make monetary policy, not fiscal or other policy. So the points I make today are from the perspective of someone who is affected ― both as a policymaker and a citizen ― by the decisions made in legislative halls, but not as someone who’s in a position to make those changes himself.\n\nMonetary policy is actually limited in its scope. Taxes and spending, debts and deficits, government funding and laws that affect the labor force are all out of our purview. The Fed’s job is to create the conditions for a strong and healthy economy. Changing the trajectory of U.S. growth will take legislative action, like investments in human and physical capital, which we can’t do. But we can point out the economic benefits.\n\nThe fact is that we have a strong labor market. We’re a far cry from the worst of the crisis when unemployment reached 10 percent. The issue now is that employers are struggling to fill the jobs they have open. Even with workforce development programs, which are also necessary, we don’t have the people to fill them. We need to close the gap in the workforce. And given the long-term demographic trends, we need to turn to outside sources.\n\nWe need people.\n\nThat’s the missing ingredient in the participation rate and in growth.\n\nOne potential source is immigration. Again, I want to be clear: I’m not suggesting immigration policy or telling anyone how to go about legislating. I don’t want to get into a debate about immigration or the questions of documented or undocumented residents. I want to talk about the numbers and the data and their potential effect on the U.S. economy.\n\nAnd from an economic standpoint, immigration, particularly high-skilled immigration, is a source of immense potential for economic growth.\n\nToday, immigration accounts for 13-plus percent of the U.S. population. This share has been steadily increasing over time: In 1990, it was 8 percent.\n\nMuch of the immigration debate surrounds the level of skill and contribution of new arrivals to the U.S. But the truth is that much of the flow of immigration over the past 15 years has been highly skilled and well educated. Over that period, the college-educated immigrant population grew from 5.9 million to 10.5 million. The native-born college-educated population also grew but at a much slower pace.\n\nMost important, immigrants tend to have a higher participation rate ― something we need.\n\nThis touches on the most prevalent concern about immigration: the fear of losing American jobs. There is, however, scant evidence to support the anxiety, especially where skilled immigrants are concerned. In fact, most studies have shown that it’s a net benefit for the rest of us.\n\nOne recent paper examined how the increased flow of immigrants in the STEM fields ― that is, science, technology, engineering, and math ― affected the labor market outcomes of native born workers.3 The researchers found that a 1 percentage point increase in the number of foreign STEM workers actually increased wage growth of the college-educated population by 7–8 percentage points in the long run, and 3–4 percentage points for those without a college education.\n\nThey also found that inflows of foreign STEM workers increase productivity growth more generally, accounting for somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of the aggregate U.S. productivity growth between 1990 and 2010. Other research backs this up.4\n\nThis reflects the “scale effect” in economic theory ― that greater population growth is tied to higher per-capita growth rates. In this model, scale comes from the theory that more ideas are developed when more people are engaged in research. Because anyone can use the same idea at the same time, any single idea can be used by lots of people to produce growth. Therefore, more people equals more ideas equals more growth.5 More than 80 percent of U.S. per capita growth in the second half of the 20th century can be attributed to this scale effect.6\n\nThe bottom line is that a larger and more highly skilled labor force fuels economic growth, something we will need to meet the demands of demography.\n\nI said I’d be academic, but on a personal note, I’d add this: Pretty much all of us are the product of immigration. At some point, near or far down the line of our ancestry, someone came to this country and helped make it what it is today. America is a constantly evolving nation, which is one of our strengths. Much of that is due to the influence of waves of immigration that brought over new ideas and swelled the workforce. It’s as true today as it was during the Industrial Revolution or at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nOne of the comparative advantages of the United States, since our inception, has been our ability to assimilate immigrants from all over. It built both the greatest economic power on the planet and the American dream that defines it. We’re good at this. We’re arguably better than anyone else on earth. So let’s play to our strengths. It’s in our own economic interest.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nSince I’ve just spent some time talking about other people’s areas of policy, I’ll be fair and talk about what lessons this has for my own.\n\nFalling participation rates pose important challenges for monetary policy. Both the aging of the population and lower productivity will likely deliver a lower natural rate of interest and slower potential GDP growth. These are difficult to measure in the first place, so changes to their fundamental nature complicates monetary policy.7\n\nA lower natural funds rate has implications for the speed at which current monetary policy should normalize. The lower the natural funds rate, the closer the current funds rate will be to that level, which means policy will have a shorter distance to travel to full normalization. That’s important because it gives us less room to maneuver. Monetary policy is a relatively blunt tool; a smaller window for operation is more appropriate for a scalpel.\n\nAnd it may be that our toolbox is getting duller: Recent studies have found that monetary policy’s efficacy has been waning since the mid-1980s, and that this can be linked to the aging of the population.8 Given our demographic realities, this puts even more pressure on fiscal and other policies to take a long-term look at policies that can nurture growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, there you have it. The U.S. labor market is strong, but participation is waning. Our economy needs a boost and immigration could be the stimulant. I’m not directing anyone which path to go down, but I am saying that we need to take one.\n\n\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014).\n\n[2]James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, 89:1 (February 2007), pp. 100–109.\n\n[3]Giovanni Peri, Kevin Y.

            "content": "Thank you, it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nI can definitively say that after the speculation about the Federal Open Market Committee’s September meeting, I’m delighted to have a break from being asked about interest rates, which means I’ll take the opportunity to not talk about interest rates. And since I’m in Ireland, a country that knows well the benefits of global trade and cooperation, I thought I’d turn to the subject of international trade.\n\nBefore I go any further, I should issue the disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nInternational trade is a sensitive topic, particularly at the moment. You’ll know it’s a subject of debate in the U.S. election, as it is in countries across the globe, from mature economies to developing ones.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve president, I obviously have no say in making the policies that govern trade. And in general, Fed policymakers avoid opining on the state of fiscal or economic policy.\n\nBut the American economy has reached a point in which monetary policy has done what it can. As everyone in this room knows, the reach and arsenal of monetary policymakers is limited. We can move rates and that’s about it — the times that call for exceptional use of mechanisms, such as quantitative easing or forward guidance, are times of economic upheaval.\n\nAt this juncture in the post-crisis recovery, at least in the U.S., it’s time for fiscal and other policies to take the reins. We cannot foster growth without long-term approaches, legislation, and investments that are far outside the scope of the Fed’s reach.\n\nSo, while I offer neither advice nor prescriptions on the subject, in the context of how trade affects the economy — and therefore the decisions I and my colleagues make about monetary policy — I feel comfortable calling for a more comprehensive and analytic review of its different aspects. Discussing the pros and cons, and even the “winners” and “losers,” is well within my purview and, I believe, necessary when discussing the future path of monetary policy in the U.S.\n\nAnd perhaps, for the sake of my colleagues back home, I should reiterate that disclaimer about these being my views and mine alone …\n\nClassical Gains from Trade\n\nIt’s clear from the media coverage, the political narrative, and the policy stances emerging around the globe that trade is experiencing a good deal of backlash from many corners.\n\nWhile resistance to international trade is not new, the central role it has taken in public discussion — and the animosity toward it — is something I haven’t seen for some time.\n\nIt is particularly acute when considering that, from a textbook standpoint, international trade makes perfect economic sense — especially under the principle of “comparative advantage.” That is, the idea that countries will import goods from abroad if they’re cheaper and export their own goods if they’re inexpensive to make at home.\n\nTrading countries can focus on producing and exporting goods that use their relatively more abundant resources, which cost less, to countries that want or need them. For goods that require resources that are relatively scarce, nations can import goods for less than they would cost to produce at home. Scotland, obviously, would find it difficult to supply its own pineapples, while Hawaii would struggle to cultivate a wool industry. International trade allows countries to focus on producing what they’re good at, rather than expending valuable time and resources attempting to produce every good they need.1\n\nWhile different geographies have different resources — and indeed, different quantities of resources — comparative advantage is a great democratizer in that everyone has one. And in a globalized economy, this increased specialization allows, for the most part, nations of all sizes to benefit from greater efficiencies in production. This ideally means that trade can make each country more productive and ultimately better off.\n\nInternational trade also allows participants to benefit from differing cycles. The creation of goods fluctuates, meaning nations can borrow and consume more in lean times and pay back debts when the output pendulum swings back to its high point. This ensures the stream of goods stays steady and stable and protects average citizens from disruptions in both availability and the prices they pay.\n\nProduction Chains\n\nAnother aspect of the ever-more integrated global economy is that an increasing share of trade involves multiple contributions along the supply chain, often across borders. For example, Japan exports raw steel to Mexico, where it’s stamped and shipped to the United States, where it’s used to make farm equipment, some of which is then exported to buyers in other countries.\n\nThe classic term for this is vertical integration or fragmentation, although it’s more commonly referred to as the dreaded outsourcing. Outsourcing obviously has negative connotations, frequently seen as the force behind exporting domestic jobs, but this is another aspect. This multiparty approach allows for more efficient organization of production and lets countries focus, again, on those areas in which they have more abundant resources or better specialization. It is an increasingly important facet of both production and international connectivity.2\n\nThis kind of global production is particularly sensitive to trade protection because every time a good crosses a border, it exposes itself to a potential tariff. This is an area in which I will tread carefully — I’m not dispensing advice on trade policy for the U.S. or any other nation. But from a purely economic perspective, it’s important to remember that the world has evolved to an interconnected economy, and trade on this level is unlikely to disappear — rather, it’s likely to be more and more a part of individual industries’ and nations’ economies. Even modest tariffs, therefore, if they are applied several times to the same production chain, would be enough to disrupt this type of trade.\n\nThe Relationship Between Trade and Growth and Trade and Income\n\nTrade can promote knowledge and expertise and, as a result, foster technical progress. A 10 percent increase in trade is associated with a 5 percent increase in income per capita.3 Likewise, an increase in international trade has a positive impact on growth rates: Doubling a country’s trade share can lead to an estimated 25 percent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) over the span of a decade.\n\nHistory is also rife with examples of trade’s benefits. Looking at economic development from 1800 to 1980, we see a steady rise in global inequality because, at the time, only developed economies were open to trade. Conversely, when we look at previously closed economies that have subsequently opened to trade, the trend is reversed.4 China is just one, but perhaps the most discussed, example of how trade allows countries to rapidly reverse their economic fates. Korea is another example, as are, increasingly, places such as Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nA powerful illustration of trade’s influence is the steady drop in global poverty. Although the world’s population grew by 1.6 billion between 1980 and 2000, the number of people living in extreme poverty actually declined by 200 million.5 While this phenomenon cannot be attributed to trade alone, it certainly played a role.6\n\nCommon Myths\n\nIf trade’s benefits are so overwhelmingly positive, why has there been such animosity toward it? I believe the answer is twofold. First, there are common myths attached to trade and its effects. Second, there are, in fact, losers in the trade game.\n\nFirst, the myths of trade. A frequent strain of the current narrative is that low-wage countries unfairly compete against mature economies, thereby having the double effect of exporting jobs away from developed countries such as the U.S. and creating scenarios in which advanced economies exploit their less developed counterparts.\n\nA more accurate depiction is that low wages are associated with lower productivity, meaning less developed economies do not, in fact, have an edge. Additionally, as trade in these goods shifts, it frees up resources in more developed economies, allowing them to concentrate on more specialized goods made by skilled workers, who, in turn, earn higher wages.\n\nAs for lower-wage countries, the simple math is that without trade, those wages would be even lower.\n\nDistributional Costs\n\nThat said, there are people who feel the downside of global trade more acutely than others.\n\nTrade, on the whole, is a benefit. It makes products cheaper, including necessities such as food, and countries tend to reap the rewards on a macro level.\n\nWhat makes the subject so heated, and so impassioned on one side, is that the many who benefit don’t do so in a life-altering way; we aren’t moved by a price change of a few dollars or cents in our everyday purchases. In the case of the U.S., the relatively abundant supply of skilled workers benefit, while the unskilled portion of the labor force can lose out to competition from abroad.\n\nThe rewards are reaped in breadth, spread among the 320-plus million people who live in the U.S. On the other hand, those who suffer do so on a catastrophic level — it affects entire industries and the populations that depended on them. Its effects are felt in depth, shouldered by a small fraction of America.\n\nEven when jobs do not disappear, there is evidence to suggest that vertical integration — wherein different parts of supply chains originate in different countries — has impacted the increasing wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers.7 In the U.S., the production chain sees more of its contributing goods imported than produced domestically, reducing demand for low-wage workers, and pushing paychecks even further down. This is not the only source of the wage disparity in the U.S. over the past 30 years. There is also the displacement of workers because of automation, and other factors, which have muddied the waters regarding the exact cause.\n\nAdditionally, industries in international competitive markets are in a race with foreign firms. Even when they succeed, it’s often the case that gains are disproportionately realized by the owners of capital instead of those working to produce it. International competition puts particular stress on areas or industries that compete with the imported good — whether the value of land for agricultural products or the return on capital for specialized workers.\n\nChina Shock\n\nChina, of course, has played the role of economic bogeyman in the trade debate. But is the fear based on facts?\n\nA recent paper on the role of trade and its effect on wage disparity, called The China Shock, has been getting a lot of press lately.8 It assesses the losses in U.S. manufacturing jobs tied to increased exposure to Chinese imports. It will come as no surprise that it is the lower end of the pay and skill spectrum that has been most affected.\n\nThe extraordinarily rapid rise of China and its focus on manufacturing and exports have created something of an economic laboratory — a rare and exceptional one. Because China’s import penetration varies widely across manufactured goods, the authors could better assess its impact by looking at industries and counties in which China has a stronger or weaker presence. That led to more detailed research and more specific findings than previous work.\n\nThe results do highlight a downside.\n\nThere were industries that were affected and unemployment followed. In many cases, contrary to general assumption, when people lost their jobs, they didn’t move or look for new ones in new areas. Instead, people stayed where they were. The jobs they lost weren’t replaced by new ones in new industries and that had significant ripple effects. Instead of replacing one manufacturing job with another, they wound up in even lower paying jobs, if they managed to find one at all. Adding to the effects was that the decline in activity by manufacturers most exposed to imports from China had spillover effects for their suppliers as well. All in all, of the 5.8 million manufacturing jobs lost in the U.S. from 1999 to 2011, about 985,000 can be attributed to trade.\n\nAs for wages, the most affected workers were those in the bottom 40 percent of the payscale. For every additional $1,000 of imports per worker, wages were reduced by $213 a year.\n\nSo, there is some truth to the worry about outside competition. Then again, it is often difficult to untangle the influence of trade from that of other factors affecting changes in wage distribution. There are causes that have nothing to do with China, such as technological advances or the waning share of specific industries — it’s worth remembering that U.S. manufacturing has been steadily declining since the end of World War II, long before China opened its doors to the rest of the world. And while there have been job losses, the authors point out that post-war trade has only had minimal influence on the wage stagnation for lower skilled workers and the overall decline in American manufacturing.\n\nThis is where I circle back to my opening remarks about monetary policy having its limits. Addressing issues of unemployment from the decline in American manufacturing requires fiscal policy and legislative action. What we haven’t done very well in the U.S. is to figure out a path for people to absorb those changes. Whether it’s some form of wage insurance or retraining, we have to find some way to help these communities, many of which have been all but abandoned, to transition to a new economic reality. I realize that’s easy to say when you’re not the one making the policy, but in my view, that sort of help is in the interest of the country as a whole.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, I can understand some of the animosity toward trade. I also see the need for policies to help alleviate the pain that those who bear the brunt of the downside encounter. But a connected world is a better place and trade helps far more people than it hurts. We just need to find a way for everyone to benefit from that free exchange.\n\n\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.

            "content": "I should start my remarks with the traditional “thank yous,” and first on that list has to be Theresa and her team — Theresa is an outstanding voice and mind on community development — and I’m so proud to have all of them here at the Philadelphia Fed.\n\nI’d also like to thank our partners Susan Wachter and The Institute for Urban Research at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThanks are also due to the Community Development teams at all the Federal Reserve Banks that helped organize this event — Philadelphia, of course, and Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Minneapolis, New York, Richmond, and St. Louis. Thanks for all your hard work.\n\nAnd finally, thank you to everyone for coming. The Reinventing Our Communities conference is our signature Community Development event, and many of you have been attending for years. This, however, is my first one. I’ve listened to some exceptional presenters and attendees and heard some great questions and even better answers.\n\nTransforming Our Economies\n\nI just want to take a few final minutes to talk about the past three days and share some thinking about the Philadelphia Fed’s plans in this arena.\n\nCommunity development work is important for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that what the Fed does and how we do it is a mystery to a lot of people. Despite what many people think, the Fed actually has a fairly limited set of tools, and the only policy we set is monetary policy. We don’t deal with taxes or spending or debts or deficits — except to the extent that they affect the overall economy.\n\nBut we do help banks meet their Community Reinvestment Act requirements, and we have a singular role in brokering relationships between funders and organizations that can use the financial help. This sounds like an odd role for policy geeks, but it actually makes perfect sense. The goal of the Fed is to create the conditions in which economic growth can thrive. One way to encourage that growth is by ensuring every part of the country — every community, every individual — has a chance to become economically self-sustaining.\n\nSome people might question why this should matter, especially if they’re not directly affected by poverty. Or they may think the time and money these organizations are expending could be better used somewhere else. So, why should they care? Why should the Fed care?\n\nAside from my personal view that we have a moral imperative to ensure that everyone has a fair chance at success, there’s a practical argument as well. Regions are best off when all their constituent areas do well. Our own economic fates are informed by our neighbors’. And the investments we make now to alleviate poverty — be they pre-K education or adult skills training — will come back to us all. That’s why we call it an investment. We’re helping to create the next workforce, the next engine of the American economy, the next wave of educators and engineers. Not to mention the people who’ll be contributing to the economy — and our Social Security — when we’ve all retired. Making sure everyone has a level playing field just makes good economic sense.\n\nAgenda on Poverty and Prosperity\n\nThat’s why I’m delighted to announce that the Philadelphia Fed will be leading an effort to bring national attention to poverty and the ways in which it influences economic growth and prosperity.\n\nWe’re calling it the Agenda on Poverty and Prosperity, an intensive research initiative to better understand how poverty affects the economy, to inform policymakers, and to use our findings to promote economic mobility. We will sponsor work on inclusive growth, tapping the nation’s best economic minds and research and pairing them with lessons gleaned from practitioners’ on-the-ground experience.\n\nWe’ll conduct and share research, host an online information and data tool for the public, and inform Federal Reserve System leadership about our findings.\n\nAdditionally, we’ll be encouraging investment in strategies that promote development and inclusion. Over the next three years, we will host a series of Economic Research in Action Labs. Top economic researchers will present their findings to leaders from the public, private, nonprofit, and philanthropic sectors in our District to help inform policy solutions.\n\nFinally, we will continue to reach out to private sector partners for their thoughts, and, of course, their resources, connecting them to practitioners who can put them to use.\n\nI want Philadelphia to be a leader in this work because I see it as a fundamental part of the long-term economic health of the region and the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nEconomies evolve, and approaches to growth and stability have to change with them. We can’t wish for the resurgence of an economy long past; we have to adapt to new realities and use the lessons we’ve learned over time to usher in that new era — ideally one in which everybody can benefit. Each of you here today has played a part in gathering the information, relating the lessons, and making the strides that have gotten us this far. I’m grateful for your work and hope that we’ll see some of you in this room presenting your research at one of our labs.\n\nFor now, I thank everyone again — for attending, for providing thoughtful and enlightening conversation, and, of course, for putting it all together.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood evening. It is a pleasure and a privilege to have the opportunity to engage with the distinguished gathering of professionals and leaders represented here at tonight’s 2016 World Class Summit.\n\nThank you, Steve Wray and Chris Chepel, for the invitation. And thank you, Bill Rhodes, for that generous introduction.\n\nTonight I am here as both a Federal Reserve Bank president and a lifelong member of this community. I was born and raised in New Jersey; spent many years at the University of Pennsylvania as a student, an academic, and an administrator; headed to Newark to serve as president of the University of Delaware; and now I am back in Philadelphia at the Fed.\n\nI drive home every day to South Jersey and plan to remain in the area long after the year 2026. So, when I am asked to speak about how we can best ensure a bright economic future for this region 10 years from now, not only do I think about this question professionally, but I also think about it on a very personal level. I am always looking for answers to this question. I look for answers in the data I pore over every day. And, I look for answers in the stories I hear from the people I meet throughout the District.\n\nI often reflect on a visit I made last October to the YouthBuild Charter School, where I met a number of young people who had previously dropped out of school. Through this program, they were earning their high school diplomas while training for jobs in construction and retail. In the hours we spent together, these young people shared stories about their hopes for the future. They were remarkably clear about the barriers and hard work they faced to get back on track. They were also very aware of how they were benefiting from this fantastic program as well as the passionate teachers and administrators who were there to keep their focus on the long term.\n\nThere is no doubt that these students embody a quintessential Philadelphia quality that I think is undervalued but incredibly important — grit. University of Pennsylvania Professor Angela Duckworth defines \"grit\" as perseverance and passion for long-term goals. Her research says the smartest of us aren't necessarily the best at our jobs, the best students, the greatest innovators, or even the most successful professionally. People with grit are those who stay focused on the long term even when things aren't going perfectly in the \"right now.\" They achieve difficult goals. They don't necessarily learn quickly or easily. They work really hard and consider life a marathon rather than a sprint.\n\nIn August, the YouthBuild students who I met last fall will be graduating. Some will go on to college, and others will find jobs in the industries for which they have trained. They will become an important part of our economy in the next 10 years. The path they have taken, and the character they have shown, will be assets that our economy needs and can use to grow.\n\nThe people of the Greater Philadelphia region embody grit — this is who we are. But how do we translate the grit that defines us into a stronger workforce that will be the foundation for a stronger economy?\n\nMy talk tonight will focus on this topic as it relates to our region's long-term health. But before we get there, I think it best to start with a look at our current economic landscape. I must offer the following disclosure: My remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Overview\n\nFor the most part, economic fundamentals appear to be solid, personal income growth has been healthy, job growth continues — albeit with some volatility — at a healthy pace, and there has been a modest increase in equity prices and continued steady growth in home prices.\n\nAdditionally, consumers appear fairly confident as measured by various indices of consumer sentiment, and household balance sheets are in good shape. These solid fundamentals have contributed to a healthy pickup in consumption with a growth rate that is likely to accelerate to a bit above 4.0 percent in the second quarter. As a result, it appears that GDP is growing above its trend rate, reversing what was a weak first quarter in which GDP grew at a mere 1.1 percent.\n\nHowever, I believe that part of the first quarter weakness was largely due to seasonal adjustment problems with measured GDP. An alternative measure of economic activity produced at our Bank, called GDPplus, indicates that the economy grew at 2.3 percent in the first quarter. Using that measure as my guide, the U.S. economy appears to be on fairly firm footing this year.\n\nBased on recent data, I anticipate that we will see growth of about 2.0 percent in 2016, increasing to roughly 2.3 percent in both 2017 and 2018. However, there are some risks to my fairly optimistic forecast.\n\nSome of those risks are reflected in the recent volatility in job growth. The latest employment report largely arrests the concerns that arose from the exceptionally weak job numbers in May, but it remains to be seen which of the latest two reports better represents the true state of the labor market.\n\nI think the best way to view the recent data is to average through it, which implies a gradual tapering in employment growth to a rate that is still considerably above that which would imply no change in the unemployment rate. Given the maturity of the recovery, I anticipate that employment growth will gradually slow to a more sustainable pace consistent with maintaining our low level of unemployment.\n\nViewing the jobs data in this way is consistent with other labor market evidence. Job openings remain at historic highs, and the high level of the quits rate indicates that workers feel fairly confident in their ability to change jobs.\n\nFurther, wage growth has been increasing steadily. Over the past three months, average hourly earnings have increased at a 2.5 percent annualized rate. Also, contacts in our region indicate that they continue to search for workers but that finding those workers with sufficient skills is getting increasingly more difficult. Nevertheless, the disconnect between the labor market and economic activity is puzzling.\n\nThe first quarter saw strong employment growth and perhaps fairly weak output growth, while the current quarter is witnessing a weakening in employment growth just as economic activity is accelerating. That behavior is creating uncertainty for both forecasters and policymakers, myself included.\n\nOther areas of concern are the manufacturing and energy sectors, which continue to struggle, although there have been some signs of recent improvement. Regional contacts appear a bit more upbeat than they were a few months ago, but the durable goods part of the market is still having a rough time. The data on core orders in April and May also do not point to any near-term strength in investment. Finally, there is the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, which may provide additional headwinds to an already struggling manufacturing sector, and further appreciation of the dollar could result in declining net exports.\n\nThat said, Brexit is low on my list of risks, and I do not anticipate more than a transitory couple of 10ths of a percentage point slowdown in growth.\n\nOn the inflation front, there are signs of firming as the dollar has stabilized, and oil and gas prices have risen substantially. Consumer price inflation continued to firm this quarter with core measures approaching the FOMC's target of 2 percent. Given these observations, I believe that inflation will return to target sometime next year. Considering the economic projections, I anticipate that it may be appropriate for up to two additional rate hikes this year and that the funds rate will approach 3.0 percent by the end of 2018.\n\nGrowing Our Human Capital\n\nNow, let's look a little closer to home. Philadelphia's economy is heating up. Job growth in the metropolitan area began outpacing U.S. job growth this year, which is not the norm. More important, Philadelphia's growth is beginning to keep pace with that of other comparably sized U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nEmployment is up in nearly every sector, and the jobless rate has risen somewhat in recent months, which reflects, in part, that more people are joining the labor force due to greater job opportunities. Still, the average over the past five months is comparable with that of the nation's. Moreover, we anticipate that the recent rise will soon reverse and that much of the rise will be smoothed away with next year's revisions.\n\nWhile housing remains sluggish in Pennsylvania as a whole and in outlying areas of the Philadelphia metropolitan area, growth has been dramatic within the City of Philadelphia. As in other large cities, the surge in development and redevelopment of housing, plus the growth of new office space, has been accompanied by commercial and mixed-use projects, which are especially appealing to millennial workers. We know that in order for us to continue on this path, productivity growth is essential.\n\nThere are two general ways productivity growth can be achieved:\n\nBoth tactics highlight the necessity of building human capital.\n\nKeeping this momentum will require us to make some targeted human capital investments and explore new ways to meet old challenges. In the time we have, I would like to highlight a few areas where I think we have some work to do as well as some of the promising strategies that are in play.\n\nI'm sure it is no surprise to you that I believe one of the answers lies in securing a solid education system that begins with pre-K for all children. The Economy League of Greater Philadelphia and other organizations across the state worked diligently to make the case for Pre-K for PA. And our economy will reap the benefits of this work down the road.\n\nHaving spent most of my career engaged in academics, I have found that it has become even more apparent over the past year working at the Fed that the foundation for a well-trained workforce begins in these early days of school. These are critical times where character, self-esteem, and work ethic — the foundations of grit — are developed.\n\nA solid education system, which includes pre-K, is something we must continue to work toward. Not only will it produce a pipeline of future Philadelphians with the grit to take on the hard work ahead, but it will also make us a more desirable place for skilled people to live.\n\nOur researchers have studied the connection between having a solid school system in place and the positive economic impact this has on cities like Philadelphia, where young, educated people choose to build their careers and raise their families.\n\nAs a former college president, my next point may sound controversial. Not everyone is going to be college-bound, and that's OK. College is not for everyone. But what is not OK is that our region has 106,000 disconnected youths, young people who are not in school or not working.\n\nThis growing figure points to the critical need for a training system in our region that is more agile, one that meets the needs of those at various skill levels. That is how we will give more of our young people a path toward success. In addition to these disconnected youths, there are many young people who start and never finish college. Why is this?\n\nIt could be that the average high school curriculum is not rigorous enough to prepare youths for college. Or maybe it's that many students who pursue college do not feel — rightly or wrongly — that the average curriculum is helpful for future employment.\n\nI pondered this daily as an academic leader and now as a Fed president because this college completion rate decline leaves our economy with young people saddled with school loan debt, without a degree, and no higher paying job to pay off this debt.\n\nAs an economist, I see a growing mismatch between what our education sector offers to students and the skills and training our business sector increasingly needs. This disparity — if left unattended — will have a significant impact. So, what can we do?\n\nAs a region, we must focus on creating a training system that is more agile, one that works in real time for our industries in need, our disconnected young people, and our long-term economy.\n\nI had the pleasure of taking Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on a tour of Philadelphia a few weeks ago. She was interested in hearing more about employment efforts that are working here in the city. On our drive through West Philadelphia, we had the opportunity to visit clients at the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative (WPSI).\n\nIn this program, anchor institutions work with and through a local nonprofit organization to identify future job openings and train local residents to fill these positions. I believe the partnerships that help to build these kinds of collaborative, innovative programs create a more agile labor market. These programs benefit the individual jobseeker, the employer, and ultimately, the economy.\n\nWe are also exploring other areas including apprenticeship programs. These programs combine study with on-the-job training and have been shown to have a sizable impact on the lives of workers and the economy in other parts of the world. So far in the U.S., we have had some limited experience, but there are huge opportunities to expand these programs.\n\nIn an assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Registered Apprenticeship program in 10 states, Mathematica Policy Research estimated that, on average, those who complete one of these registered programs can expect to be compensated nearly $300,000 more over their lifetimes — including benefits — than those who do not. We can and should find ways to expand these programs in our region.\n\nThe Delaware Valley chapter of the National Tooling and Machining Association plans to develop an apprenticeship program in precision machining. In May, the Fed's Community Development Studies & Education Department organized a meeting in which the program was introduced to workforce and manufacturing leaders in Philadelphia.\n\nAttendees included representatives from Philadelphia Works, Inc.; the Community College of Philadelphia; the School District of Philadelphia; and three local manufacturing organizations. What came out of this meeting was a genuine interest in working together. Our partners are now exploring ways in which we can work with a local high school to possibly use their facilities to grow these programs.\n\nHere again is a training system that meets the needs of manufacturers in our region who can't find skilled employees. And for the unemployed and underemployed, it provides good-paying jobs and long-term careers. We need to be creative and look for ways to boost this model in the areas of technology and other sectors to capture the imagination of young workers and to provide the training and skills they need.\n\nCollaborative Leadership Is Key\n\nThe late John W. Gardner once said, \"When an institution, organization, or nation loses its capacity to inspire high individual performance, its great days are over.\"\n\nOur efforts to strengthen the region's human capital are important ways for us to ensure that our great days are ahead. It is through collaborative leadership — like that demonstrated by the Economy League and its World Class Greater Philadelphia Agenda — that our region can think critically and act decisively on behalf of our region's economic future.\n\nThe Economy League — and nearly 2,000 regional businesses, nonprofits, government, labor, and community leaders — are improving education and talent outcomes in our region, boosting business growth, and making our infrastructure more effective and reliable. It is through such efforts that we will make sure there are skilled people to hire when our region's projected 3 million square feet of new office and mixed-use space is ready. We must deliver on the challenge of having the resources, vision, and leadership to make full use of our District's potential.\n\nThe Philadelphia Fed stands ready to partner with you in this effort. This year, we created a new council, made up of both for-profit and nonprofit leadership, with the purpose of working collaboratively to address the critical issues impacting our region. Over the next year, we will be working with the council on key issues, including human capital, to identify ways in which the Fed can better leverage its research and facilitation resources to strengthen our economy.\n\nWe are ready to work toward our shared goal of fostering human capital needed to build this region today and tomorrow. My expectation is that this collaboration will yield impacts for the region for years to come.\n\nWhen I think about all we are discussing today, I picture myself opening up the Philadelphia Inquirer in 2026 and flipping to the business section — and, yes, I believe I will still be reading a paper publication in 2026. I also believe that, if we stay focused, I will be reading about the fruits of our labor.\n\nAnd please, let there be a big Carson Wentz profile on the cover of the sports section about his early retirement after multiple Super Bowl wins for the Eagles. Or even just one!\n\nBut seriously, what will get us through tough and unpredictable times — with limited fallout — is the grit and agility we start producing today. The investment we make in human capital will position us for a healthy tomorrow.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. I want to thank Phil Wenger for that kind introduction.\n\nI would also like to thank Jim Edrington of the ABA (American Bankers Association) and my Fed colleague and Stonier board member, Connie Wallgren, for inviting me here to speak with you today.\n\nA New Journey\n\nSo, this is the first time I am delivering a new class welcome speech not as an academic, dean, or university president. I have to admit that it feels kind of strange. At the same time, it offers a nice change of perspective.\n\nFor instance, as I look out at this distinguished crowd this morning, I can't help but ponder how many of you I can recruit to the Fed upon graduation. But seriously, I can relate to how many of you must feel as you embark on this new journey, whether you are just entering or graduating next week.\n\nIt has been almost a year since I joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia as its president and CEO. I came to the position after a long career in academia, mostly here at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nI would imagine that you might have mixed feelings of excitement, fear, hope, and the desire for a new challenge. Sure, there are many unknowns ahead, but what is certain is that the step you take here is a necessary one toward the highest leadership in your industry. I know your field faces major challenges each day due to new regulations, technologies, and security.\n\nWhen I was the dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and now as president of the Philadelphia Fed, many of my days are spent with banking leaders. Along with my colleagues in Supervision and Regulation at the Fed, we are in touch regularly with industry leaders every day to discuss ways to ensure the safety, soundness, and vitality of our financial institutions.\n\nThe Fed aims to provide appropriate balance to the oversight of these organizations in our District. This can be tricky at times, and, as with any industry or situation in which change is a constant, great leadership is needed.\n\nLeaders are needed who can anticipate what may be coming, plan appropriately for it, and inspire and teach their teams at the same time. This is no easy feat, but you are in the right place to learn.\n\nFrom the University of Pennsylvania\n\nAlthough I am no longer at the University of Pennsylvania, it is a place that never leaves me. Not a day goes by at the Fed that a Wharton professor, piece of research, book, or conference doesn't come up in conversation. And, so many at the Fed bring their Stonier and Wharton experience to work, which is such an asset to the Bank. I use my own education at Penn to apply problem-solving skills from my engineering days to tackle great issues in our economy.\n\nFor those entering Stonier, an unparalleled experience awaits you. Your courses will be grounded in the reality of today's marketplace. For those graduating, you know I speak the truth.\n\nI know from my own Wharton experience that the faculty members here are some of the best in the world in teaching executives how to show up and perform. In moments of crisis, confusion, and change, some people without formal training might mistakenly throw in the towel at a key moment or choose to steamroll ahead without a team.\n\nYour three years here will help you recognize and address the changes and opportunities in your path that can create value in your organizations. But perhaps the hardest part of this learning involves both skill and character. It is learning how to become someone who others will admire and follow. This is lifelong learning.\n\nA Few Words of Wisdom\n\nFor those heading back to campus, perhaps you will humor me as you consider a few suggestions and lessons I have learned about leadership over the years and during my past 11 months at the Fed. I do believe they apply wherever you are in your career.\n\nNo. 1: It's good to set your course but make sure it's not too straight.\n\nYou are not out here on your own. Because you chose to continue your education, you now have access to Stonier and Wharton professors, along with more than 20,000 Stonier alumni and Wharton's 94,000 graduates.\n\nBut just because everything is lining up as it should and you may know the exact course you would like to take in your career, it doesn't mean that walking a straight line from point A to point B is the best way.\n\nEducation isn't a race; it's a journey. My advice for you, which I use myself, is to get lost on occasion. Wander around. Be accessible. In fact, throughout your studies and beyond, schedule time for random conversations with smart people who may have little to do with your classes or professions.\n\nI say this for two reasons:\n\nFirst, the smart people around me every day — some of whom have worked with me several times — make sure that the very first thing I do when I come on board is to walk the halls and schedule lunches with employees.\n\nAs a leader of your organization, you should do this. It's a fun and invaluable use of your time, and it gives you a chance to get to know employees and customers and see what their day to day is like.\n\nSecond, another benefit of wandering around aimlessly every now and then is that you never know what might pique your interest for further learning.\n\nSuccessful leaders are well read, well rounded, and able to strike up a conversation at any moment. I personally believe that, in banking, it is perhaps as important to have an inherent capacity for numbers as it is to cultivate an intuitive sense for people and relationships. A campus is a wonderful place to practice the social aspect of your leadership.\n\nNo. 2: There is something else I have learned to value greatly from my first year at the Fed: Groupthink does not benefit anyone, especially a leader. Similar to a room filled with bankers, a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, D.C. is made up of smart, headstrong, and independent individuals.\n\nAs regional Fed presidents — tasked with a dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices — we come to eight annual FOMC meetings armed with regional, data-driven, and anecdotal perspectives to contribute to a national conversation. The goal of the interaction is for each individual's perspective to fit into a larger, national equation. I have found the FOMC meetings to be an example of a great challenge in leadership — in this case, of Chair Janet Yellen.\n\nIn becoming a leader, one must learn how to steer strong personalities toward one unified goal in a set amount of time. The best way to do this, while developing your organization's talent, is to discourage a groupthink environment. It is easy for an organization to fall into this dynamic, but it is ultimately the wrong direction. The best decisions and results in which I have taken part within the central banking system have come through lively and thoughtful debate.\n\nThe next three years will offer a great opportunity for you to develop the ability to discuss and formulate different theories productively, respectfully, and efficiently.\n\nNo. 3: Another key every day is to know what you can and cannot change.\n\nWe know our limits as policymakers, and we must remind the public of them regularly. The Fed is not in a position to make great changes that can move the needle on the long-term health of the economy. These types of sweeping moves come from policy decisions focused on areas such as taxes, education, and immigration.\n\nI believe there is a lesson to be learned about the importance of quickly and clearly identifying what you can accomplish — whether it seems significant or not to the outside world — and to do it very well.\n\nFinally, it's a good idea for every leader to learn how to keep the long view of a situation as the focal point.\n\nSomething you may face in moving up in leadership — and this is certainly the case in guiding monetary policy — is that the decisions you make today may not play out for some time. In fact, it may be years after you have left your position that the fruits of your labor actually produce the best results. This can be challenging on a personal level; however, it is the responsibility of you as a leader to make the moves today that will best position the organization — not you — tomorrow.\n\nWhen others look back at the past, what should matter is that you are regarded as someone who had the organization's best interests at heart. Perhaps you could spend some time thinking about this inside and outside the classroom. Maybe it's a topic you haven't yet considered.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nIn closing, banks are at the heart of our free market system. And there is a true need for effective and efficient funding of companies. In addition, we also must make sure that American citizens can save for the future they want to create.\n\nI believe that banks are only as strong as the people who run them; that is why I am pleased to take time this morning to be with you. I believe, fundamentally, in the Stonier approach to help you become the kind of banking leaders your organization and the country needs.\n\nCongratulations and thank you for your time. I believe we have time for questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood evening. Thanks, Luke, for that kind introduction. It’s always good to see familiar faces from the Fed.\n\nI would also like to thank Howard Trauger and the Bond Club of Philadelphia as well as Jeremy Bach of the CFA Society of Philadelphia for inviting me here to speak with you.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\n\nToday, I would like to offer my views on the economy and how they influence my assessment of appropriate monetary policy.\n\nI believe that normalization of monetary policy is an important aspect for guaranteeing that the U.S. economy remains on a solid path, but the timing of that normalization is also key in ensuring continued economic growth and a return of inflation to target. It is also important for participants on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to express their views on the policy process as well as how they anticipate that process will unfold.\n\nTransparency is a central feature of policy. It helps align the public’s views with those of the FOMC’s, allowing policy to proceed more efficiently. Further, it helps avoid unanticipated outcomes that could interfere with the intentions of policymakers like me.\n\nBefore offering my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and how I believe monetary policy should evolve, I need to provide the following small disclaimer: These views are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the FOMC or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic activity of late, at least as measured by headline GDP, has slowed noticeably. After a subdued fourth quarter when real output increased by 1.4 percent, the advance estimate for the first quarter indicated that the economy grew at a mere 0.5 percent.\n\nPerhaps most troubling was the loss of momentum in consumer spending, which grew at an unexpectedly modest rate of 1.9 percent. This growth was significantly weaker than the healthy 3.10 percent growth achieved last year.\n\nInvestment was also exceptionally weak, declining by 5.9 percent at an annual rate, but I, like many economic commentators, believe this is temporary and largely induced by two factors: (1) the weakness in mining and drilling and (2) the waning drag of a fairly significant appreciation of the dollar that’s had a negative impact on our manufacturing sector.\n\nAn important question is: How much of the weakness in the first quarter GDP report is due to residual problems in seasonal adjustment that have long plagued this series? For example, first quarters, from 1985 through 2015, have experienced the lowest annualized growth of any quarter in 16 of the 31 years. This is a definite statistical anomaly.\n\nMoreover, first quarter growth has averaged more than a percentage point less than the growth rates we have witnessed in the succeeding three quarters. Again, a statistically significant magnitude.\n\nIf the problem of seasonal adjustment remains, which I am of the opinion that it does, the growth over the rest of the year should be considerably more upbeat than what transpired in the first quarter.\n\nA measure we construct at the Philadelphia Fed that incorporates data both on expenditures and income, referred to as GDPplus, is immune from seasonality problems and has a number of other attractive properties. It indicates that first quarter growth was 1.25 percent, which is admittedly not an overwhelming growth rate, but it is nowhere as troubling as the advance GDP estimate.\n\nWith some of the near term weakness, I remain guardedly optimistic about our economic prospects. The labor market remains extraordinarily dynamic.\n\nAlthough the latest employment report of 160,000 net new jobs surprised most commentators to the downside — and although this figure is less than the 200,000 jobs growth we have become accustomed to — I believe much of the apparent decline can be attributed to unseasonably cold weather in April. A so-called unseasonal seasonal.\n\nWork done at the Philadelphia Fed on “Weather Adjusting for Economic Data” indicates that a more accurate reading of April employment growth would place that number at around 229,000 net new jobs, implying that the labor market continues to add jobs at a long-run unsustainable rate.\n\nThat number is also more in line with the view obtained from looking at the “Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey” (JOLTS) data, where job opening rates are at near-record levels. In addition, quit rates are approximately at their prerecession levels, and hiring rates remain at very healthy levels.\n\nLikewise, we are beginning to see some acceleration in wage growth, especially among those remaining in the same job. Anecdotes abound about the difficulty in finding skilled workers in certain job categories. Furthermore, many economic fundamentals remain sound, and our financial system is in good shape. Income growth is solid, and household balance sheets remain healthy. The latest retail sales numbers confirm the underlying strength of consumers. Also, the housing market continues to grow slowly and steadily, and house prices continue to appreciate.\n\nI believe it is worth noting that the U.S. economy just weathered a series of very negative headwinds and still continues to grow, for the most part, shrugging off what would probably throw a weaker economy into recession.\n\nSlowing growth in China has depressed commodity prices and has led to a pronounced retrenchment in investment and employment in our energy sectors. The appreciation of the dollar has weighed heavily on manufacturing, but even here, there are signs that this sector has bottomed out.\n\nThe Institute of Supply Management Manufacturing Index has nudged into expansionary territory over the past two months, confirming, at the national level, the improvement that has been seen in several regional surveys. And the sharp and volatile decline we witnessed in equity markets earlier in the year has subsided, and market indices are now higher on the year. Finally, the price of oil appears to have stabilized at roughly 40 percent above the lows we saw earlier this year. With solid fundamentals and a calming in first quarter headwinds, I anticipate continued modest economic improvement over the rest of the year.\n\nLet me also emphasize, that as a policymaker, I think it is important to take a long-term view rather than react to short-term volatility and, thus, consider an array of data and longer-term trends in forming my policy stance. As I said, over the longer run, I am relatively optimistic about the health of our economy.\n\nFocus on the Region\n\nWhile much of my take on the economy is based on analyzing national economic statistics and evaluating their implications through the lenses of other models, I also rely heavily on information gained closer to home. It is often more timely, and, when it comes from our many diverse contacts in the region, it is imbued with a richer texture than mere numbers can provide.\n\nConditions in the Philadelphia area1 have closely tracked national trends throughout the current recovery. Although the area was not hit as hard as the nation during the recession, it has recovered a bit more slowly, taking about one year longer to recover jobs that were lost.\n\nBut recent job growth has been robust, with around 25,000 jobs — seasonally adjusted — in the first quarter of this year. This is among the region’s top-10 fastest growth rates for any three-month period since 1990.\n\nContacts in the region say that it seems wage pressures are building, especially among jobs in skilled occupations. Further, firms continue to anticipate solid job growth throughout the year. These types of interactions have served to buttress my view that the economy remains on solid footing.\n\nThe national resurgence of cities and a desire for urban living among millennials and retirees alike has had a noticeable impact on Center City Philadelphia and the region as a whole.\n\nWe’ve seen significant construction activity on projects for multifamily residential, commercial retail, new office space, and industrial warehousing.\n\nLooking at this behavior happening in my own backyard has helped me interpret the evolving nature of the construction industry. There are deep structural changes occurring in this industry and changes we need to better understand if we will react appropriately as policymakers.\n\nUrban projects that are already in the pipeline will keep local construction workers busy for several years and have made me more optimistic that both residential and nonresidential construction will contribute to economic growth going forward.\n\nInflation Target\n\nLet me now turn to another important component of the U.S. economy that significantly influences monetary policy, and that is inflation. This continues to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target, especially when considering the headline numbers.\n\nOver the past 12 months, headline PCE has been growing at only 0.8 percent, while the less volatile core measure has been increasing at a closer-to-target 1.6 percent. Both the decline in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, the appreciation of the dollar, have held down headline inflation.\n\nOther measures of inflation that also remove the more volatile and transitory components of price changes, and thus, reflect a more accurate reading on price pressures, have remained closer to the FOMC’s long-run target. For example, a series the Dallas Fed uses to measure PCE inflation — which I highly regard — has inflation growing by 1.8 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nI believe that, once energy prices stabilize and start reversing, inflation will return to our 2 percent target by sometime next year. The latest CPI report appears to confirm this view as headline CPI rose by a greater-than-expected 0.4 percent in April, and the details of the report suggest that we will see significant firming in the core PCE index this quarter as well.\n\nBut as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has emphasized, inflation expectations are also a crucial ingredient in formulating monetary policy. This is because a divergence of expectations from our target would make attaining our inflation target harder to achieve.\n\nSo far, survey evidence, like that obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, does not indicate any unanchoring of inflation expectations. And while market-based measures of inflation expectations are a bit on the low side, they have rebounded somewhat of late and should continue to rebound as inflation returns to target.\n\nThat said, inflation has been consistently below target for a number of years, and the difficulty in bringing inflation back to target does call for careful monitoring of our progress on this front. Failure to attain our target — even with the degree of monetary accommodation that has characterized recent monetary policy — could be considered a downside risk to my fairly optimistic view that inflation will return to target relatively quickly.\n\nHowever, there are also risks to the upside. I believe that wage pressures are building and will continue to do so as the labor market moves beyond full employment. With productivity somewhat weak, unit labor costs will accelerate, and, at some point, firms will have no choice but to start passing these price pressures onto consumers. Additionally, the rise in energy prices, although they should remain at low levels for some time, will contribute to inflation.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nMy approach to policy is to conduct it in ways that will best serve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Regarding the employment side of our mandate, I believe we have, for the most part, attained our goal already and that the labor market is basically functioning at full employment.\n\nOver the medium term, I remain confident that inflation will return to target. Energy prices have rebounded a bit, and with the dollar depreciating slightly as of late, the math is in our favor. This means that these factors will no longer exert a deflationary impact. Thus, I see headline measures falling in line with the more stable core-type measures, and I see upward pressure on these measures as well.\n\nAs actual inflation rises, so will market-based measures of inflation expectations, and so the current low readings will recover and eliminate one of the risks to normalizing policy. If the economy follows the path I expect it to follow, monetary policy will be overly accommodative by historical standards. That will set in motion the possibility of another risk, which is accelerating inflation and the need for aggressive policy actions.\n\nThese types of actions that have typically been necessary to rein in accelerating inflation have also been associated with negative economic outcomes. Therefore, we need to minimize the possibility that we could once again find ourselves in that predicament.\n\nAlthough I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, I can easily see the possibility of two or three rate hikes over the remainder of the year. That said, all forecasts are subject to fairly wide confidence bands, and mine is no exception.\n\nSo, even though I am aware that many of you are growing tired of the phrase “data dependent,” that is exactly what I will be. In the end, it is the tried-and-true way for conducting monetary policy.\n\nClosing\n\nIn summary, I believe that as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity growing at trend or slightly above trend — the unemployment rate below its natural rate — and price pressures starting to assert themselves, policy can truly normalize.\n\nI mean this in the sense that we can meaningfully move away from the zero lower bound and that our reaction to incoming data can return to a more historical pattern. That would not necessarily imply an overly aggressive path for policy. As I said, there will likely be two or perhaps even three rate hikes over the course of the year.\n\nWe should proceed slowly for two reasons: (1) because it may take some time for inflation to begin moving up in a sustainable fashion and (2) because the neutral funds rate is probably a good deal lower than it was 15 years ago. Thus, it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries.\n\nThank you. I believe we have some time for questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]The Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD-MSA includes Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia counties, PA; Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Salem counties, NJ; New Castle County, DE; and Cecil County, MD.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. Thanks to Bob Kane for that kind introduction.\n\nI would also like to thank the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, particularly President and CEO Rob Wonderling, for inviting me here today. As someone who has spent most of his life in this region and believes firmly in the integral role of business in enabling communities to thrive, I deeply value the important work of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce.\n\nI am especially thrilled to note that my friend and former colleague John Fry will serve as the next chairman of the chamber, and I applaud that excellent choice.\n\nLet me also acknowledge Emily Bittenbender, the recent recipient of the chamber’s prestigious Paradigm Award. How wonderful and appropriate that this year’s award honored someone in the construction field.\n\nEmily has not only broken barriers, but she has opened doors and created countless job opportunities during her career. That is a subject I care deeply about and will discuss in a few minutes.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\n\nToday I would like to offer my views on the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy. As always, my views are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAfter expressing my views on our nation’s economic health and prospects, I would like to offer a few observations about our local economic landscape. I will concentrate on what I believe are the inherent strengths and challenges in the Greater Philadelphia economy as it relates to the construction and real estate sectors.\n\nAn Economic Snapshot\n\nDespite a subdued fourth quarter when real GDP increased by 1.4 percent and a bumpy start to the year, I remain upbeat. Economic fundamentals are sound, and our financial system is in good shape. Labor markets remain dynamic, income growth is solid, and consumer spending continues to increase at a solid pace.\n\nIf there is anything that I believe would pose any risk to the forecast I will deliver, it would be the strong dollar and weakening growth in China. The effects that these developments may have on the U.S. economy are something that we continue to watch closely.\n\nEquity Markets\n\nEquity markets have been volatile, but despite the volatility, equity prices are pretty much where they started at the beginning of the year. Much of the volatility we have experienced is no doubt related to worries about the underlying strength in worldwide economic activity. This is especially the case with China and the continued negative impact of the strong dollar. Taken together, slower Chinese growth and the high value of the dollar create some downside risk to my assessment of future economic activity.\n\nThat said, since recent signs are pointing to a bottoming out in manufacturing activity and China is not our major trading partner, I remain optimistic that solid fundamentals will be the overriding determinant of future U.S. economic activity.\n\nAs a policymaker, I think it is important to take a long-term view rather than to react to short-term volatility and, thus, consider an array of data and longer-term trends in forming our policy stance. As I said, over the longer run, I am relatively optimistic.\n\nInflation\n\nLet me now turn to another important component of the U.S. economy that significantly influences monetary policy, and that is inflation. This continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target in 2015. Both the fall in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, the appreciation of the dollar have held down headline inflation, or total inflation, which includes commodities such as food and energy prices.\n\nInflation measures that remove these more volatile components are not far from our goal of 2 percent. I believe that once energy prices stabilize and start reversing, inflation will return to our 2 percent target. I see headline inflation accelerating at an annual average pace of 1.5 percent by the second half of this year.\n\nBut as Fed Chair Janet Yellen has emphasized, inflation expectations are also a crucial ingredient in formulating monetary policy. She notes, “Convincing evidence that longer-run inflation expectations have moved lower would be a concern.” This is because such expectations would make attaining our inflation target harder to achieve.\n\nSo far, survey evidence, like that obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, does not indicate any unanchoring of inflation expectations. However, market-based measures are showing that investors are seeking less compensation for inflation. But there are downside risks to my baseline forecast. In particular, we have been below our inflation target for all but two years since 2008. Consistently below-target outcomes will eventually lead to a lack of credibility for our 2 percent goal. Hence, it may be worth erring on the side of accommodation to ensure against that outcome.\n\nHowever, there are also risks to the upside. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that firms are planning to raise wages, especially for jobs that are proving to be hard to fill.\n\nI do expect some faster wage growth going forward, and accelerating wage growth could translate into more robust inflation. Additionally, it is unlikely that oil prices will continue to drop, and eventually, they will contribute rather than detract from inflation.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nMy approach to policy is to conduct it in ways that will best serve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. Given the behavior of oil prices, inflation is likely to be quite low in the first quarter of the year, probably even negative. Regarding the employment side of our mandate, I believe we will attain our goal early this year, if we have not attained it already.\n\nOver the medium term, I remain confident that inflation will return to target. Math is in our favor: Energy prices would need to fall again and, by a similar magnitude, to renew their downward pressure on inflation. In other words, even if energy prices remain at very low levels, inflation should naturally rebound as current prices become the base upon which price increases are computed.\n\nSimilarly, import prices should stabilize as the dollar does, removing another source of downward pressure on inflation. Granted, this process will take some time as the price cuts are transmitted across the economy.\n\nAlthough I remain confident that inflation will return to the Committee’s 2 percent target, my outlook sees it doing so only gradually. As I mentioned before, global headwinds point to some downside risks to my economic outlook.\n\nThese considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. So, I am approaching near-term policy more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent.\n\nAnd attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy.\n\nI believe as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity growing at trend or slightly above trend, the unemployment rate below its natural rate, and price pressures starting to assert themselves, policy can truly normalize. I mean this in the sense that we can move away meaningfully from the zero lower bound and that our reaction to incoming data can return to a more historical pattern.\n\nThat would not necessarily imply an overly aggressive path for policy. Thus, it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries.\n\nReal Estate\n\nLooking at real estate in more detail, residential investment is an emerging bright spot for the national economy as growth in this sector is currently well above its historical average. The demand for housing has picked up, and prices of houses and especially rentals are growing strongly.\n\nWhile much of the initial real estate gains were in multifamily units, which remains robust, new single-family homes have also started to accelerate more noticeably over the past year or so. This is a national trend we saw happen first in cities such as New York and San Francisco already. Now Philadelphia is seeing this same kind of urban gentrification.\n\nMuch has been written about the influx of millennials to Center City as well as the challenges of keeping them here. Good schools, jobs, and competitive tax structures are critical.\n\nSince 1992, census data show a dramatic rise in the proportion of urban versus suburban housing construction. We looked at Philadelphia and seven surrounding counties over the past few decades:\n\nThis residential growth has been accompanied by office growth as well. This has boosted both an improving daytime and nighttime population, which creates a vibrant city on a 24-hour basis.\n\nAccording to the Center City District and Central Philadelphia Development Corporation, the average household income for core Center City residents is more than $100,000. This has increased the demand for retail and is prompting the development of other sites on Market East.\n\nOther highlights include:\n\nI toured Camden last week with Mayor Dana Redd as part of a larger discussion on community revitalization. It is wonderful to see the recent shift in momentum there. These are just a few projects that show how this region ― and its cities in particular ― are seeing an increase in demand for urban, residential, and mixed-use development.\n\nDespite our region’s recent growth, we are seeing little evidence of widespread construction-related cost pressures for either materials or labor.\n\nWeak global demand has been driving energy and commodity prices lower this past year. In fact, material costs have fallen as a result as well as the cost of transporting these supplies.\n\nAs long as current global market conditions remain, I do not anticipate any significant movement in these prices in 2016. I expect construction costs to increase at or below that of the general economy in the near term. Further, labor costs are generally rising in step with that of the general economy.\n\nEmployment\n\nLet me now focus more closely on the labor market, employment opportunities, and workforce development issues for the nation and our region.\n\nI am fortunate to have joined the Fed at a time when our business climate maintains a steady and gradual improvement, and though challenges remain, we continue making strides. Robust employment growth, increased disposable income, and fairly healthy household balance sheets should cause consumption to grow this year by 2.7 percent, and it is the consumer who will underpin the economic progress in my forecast.\n\nOne of the fundamental strengths supporting this economic growth will be the continued strength in job growth. Each of the past three years has witnessed the creation of more than 2 million net new jobs, and many of those jobs were in highly skilled professions.\n\nAlthough I expect that employment growth will slow somewhat, I am still expecting a year in which the economy creates in the neighborhood of 2 million net new jobs. We are well on pace to reach this target as monthly job gains have averaged 209,000 for the first three months of the year.\n\nThe number of job openings nationally remains above prerecession levels, and in my meetings around the District, I often hear employers lament about the difficulty in finding the right workers. While recruiting and attracting talent is becoming more challenging for many of your organizations, it is also a sign of the steady improvements and resiliency of our labor markets.\n\nThe rate of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs ― another key indicator of how people view their own employment prospects ― has also recently reached prerecession levels. Due to this reduction in labor market slack, I anticipate stronger wage growth than the 2 percent or so that we achieved last year.\n\nWorkers returning to the labor force have also boosted the participation rate for three consecutive months, and we are now just shy of 63 percent. Our participation rate was hit hard by the recession, but it is a number that is also heavily influenced by demographics and social shifts as well as by the number of discouraged workers. For instance, in the 1960s and ’70s, women entered the workforce in greater numbers, so we saw the participation rate spike.\n\nWhile 63 percent is still low by historical standards, the participation rate began trending down from its peak value of 67.3 in 2000 as baby boomers started their transition from work to retirement.\n\nThere’s no doubt that discouraged workers accelerated the participation rate drop we experienced in recent years; however, I feel any further reductions we could experience moving forward is more likely to be caused by retirements and school enrollment versus discouraged workers.\n\nAlthough we experienced a small cyclical uptick in the March unemployment rate to 5.0 percent, I believe that the overall strength in job growth could bring the unemployment rate down to 4.7 percent by year-end.\n\nSo, what does this mean for you and other business leaders who I have spoken with who need trained workers to grow their businesses? It means that we must all take an active role in developing our future workforce. We have the people.\n\nThere are more than 106,000 young people aged 16 to 24 in Greater Philadelphia who are not in school and not working. Over the past 15 years, the participation of young people in the labor force has declined from 66 percent to 55 percent.\n\nWe need to invest in this untapped resource. One organization I want to make sure everyone here knows about is the YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School. Last fall, I saw firsthand the difference the school is making in helping young people get an education and learn valuable skills, including in the building trades.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta produced a major research study on opportunity occupations in the nation’s largest metropolitan economies in 2015. Opportunity occupations are jobs that pay at least the national median salary and are accessible to those without a bachelor’s degree.\n\nWe need to support the growth of opportunity occupations through apprenticeships and mentorship programs that provide training and guidance.\n\nHow many people here started working when they were teenagers? Me, too, on a farm near my hometown in New Jersey. I still reflect on things that I learned there and feel grateful for the trust placed in me by John McGroarty, my first boss. I learned about the opportunities that come from working hard and the perseverance it takes to improve when you make a mistake.\n\nConclusion\n\nI hope that I have paid John’s trust and patience forward. One of my primary focuses as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is on exploring ways to strengthen the Third District in the area of workforce development. We want to hear from you and other employers about how we can be helpful. We have so much potential here.\n\nI have covered a fair bit of ground here, so let me wrap up by summarizing my main points. Overall, my view of the economy is upbeat. Our financial system is in good shape, our economic fundamentals are sound, our labor markets remain dynamic, and our income growth is solid. Consumer spending is also increasing at a solid pace.\n\nWe continue to face our challenges head on, and in doing so, we have made significant economic strides as a nation and as a region. The renovation and revival of this beautiful building ― where we are today and of other sites on North Broad Street ― are illustrative of the resources we have for growth and renewal.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. Thank you for coming out today to discuss the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and the White House Promise Zone Initiative: Camden Promise Zone.\n\nI would like to thank our partners for helping to organize today’s gathering: the FDIC, the Camden Redevelopment Agency, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nFinally, thank you, Mayor Dana Redd, and the City of Camden for welcoming us here to discuss the exciting goals of the White House Promise Zone Initiative. We look forward to discussing how locally developed plans can leverage private-sector investments that can create jobs and increase long-standing economic health.\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act\n\nI was born and raised right next door in Gloucester City, and my mother called North Camden her home as a child and young adult. Since I am a South Jersey native, it is wonderful to see all of the recent momentum and investment in the City of Camden.\n\nYou can see that anchor institutions, new businesses, and the city’s residents are all engaged in the effort to revitalize and transform this great city. The bustle of the downtown area — and on campus — tells us something new is happening.\n\nI have spent most of my life in the Third District, so it is an honor to give back to the region via my role at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank plays many roles throughout the Third District, which comprises eastern Pennsylvania, South Jersey, and Delaware. But in all we do, we must follow the goals of our dual mandate and that is to maximize employment and stabilize prices.\n\nOne of the critical functions we play involves regulating banks and serving as a resource to them in their ever-changing environment. Our cosponsor today ― the FDIC ― is also responsible for regulating banks, as is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which examines national banks. Among our other responsibilities, we are all tasked with ensuring that our financial institutions are meeting their requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act or CRA.\n\nAs you all know, the CRA is an affirmative obligation for banks to lend, invest, and provide services where they operate. This includes help to low- and moderate-income communities as well as to low- and moderate-income individuals.\n\nThe CRA is both community focused and results oriented. Today, you will hear about some of the programs that have leveraged CRA capital to help revitalize communities and provide opportunity to residents. To support economic transformation in underserved communities, banks have used their CRA capital to partner with nonprofits and community development financial institutions.\n\nCamden\n\nToday, we will focus specifically on the impact of capital on building economically healthy and sustainable communities.\n\nThrough a small business loan, local entrepreneurs in Camden can provide for their families while increasing jobs for local residents. Such job creation can also revitalize the city.\n\nThrough an affordable mortgage, a young couple can fulfill their dream of becoming homeowners. As they build equity in their homes, they are creating wealth they can rely on in the future. And ― through their purchase ― they are making an investment in the city that will have a tremendous impact on the next generation of Camden residents.\n\nThrough a partnership with a community development financial institution, the creation of a grocery store, a housing development, a child-care facility, or a federally qualified health clinic can become a reality.\n\nAs you will hear from Mayor Redd and others, now is a critical time in Camden’s history. The federal government, prominent corporations, and others are becoming more aware of the great opportunities for investment here.\n\nSo, how do financial institutions more effectively engage in efforts that can benefit current Camden residents? And how can this be done while investments continue to support major changes going on in the city?\n\nOne way might be via the CRA. It is a tool that can ensure Camden has access to the resources it needs. This capital can provide pathways to all kinds of opportunities benefiting families, neighborhoods, and the city as a whole.\n\nToday’s Event\n\nToday’s event will explore this option in more depth. We will also see where Camden is heading as the city begins to implement plans that have been developed through collaborative leadership.\n\nFinally, panel discussions will provide examples of programs and solutions that have leveraged CRA loans, both locally and throughout other regions.\n\nConclusion\n\nLater today, I will take a tour of the city and will meet with public, private, and nonprofit leaders to learn more about their work and future plans.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia looks forward to using what we learn today ― and working with you ― to support the leaders of this city in their efforts to foster a strong, vibrant, and inclusive economy.\n\nSo, once again, I want to thank you for being here for this important conversation.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good evening and thank you for being here tonight. It is always a pleasure to be back at the University of Pennsylvania. I have spent 30 years of my career on college campuses, and nothing matches their innovation and knowledge creation anywhere.\n\nI am happy to cross paths again with Susan Wachter, codirector of the Penn Institute for Urban Research and a former colleague of mine at the Wharton School. Susan is the coeditor of the book we are here to discuss tonight, Shared Prosperity in America’s Communities. The book is an example of the great work Penn IUR continues to do to bring attention ― and solutions ― to issues that have an impact on urban areas.\n\nI would also like to recognize the contributions to this book that the Community Development Studies & Education team has made. This includes Dr. Lei Ding, who served as the book’s co-editor.\n\nShared Prosperity in America’s Communities is an impressive collection of essays from respected researchers and thinkers that explores the intersection of inequality and place. This is the fourth in a series of books that the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and Penn IUR have published together. These volumes stem from our joint biennial conference, Reinventing Our Communities. Each conference ― and accompanying book ― highlights the issues that have an impact on older industrial communities.\n\nI can’t think of a more important or timely topic for communities than inequality and social mobility. I am so pleased that this was both the focus of our 2014 Reinventing conference and tonight’s book.\n\nAs reflected by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, economic inequality has long been of interest to the Fed. Chair Yellen has expressed a desire to engage in more research on community development topics, including factors that influence economic mobility.\n\nAs the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I fully support her interest in increasing our focus here. And as one of my own goals, I hope the dialogue on such topics continues to happen often. I believe tonight’s book helps bridge a gap that is part of the larger conversation on issues including social mobility, economic inclusion, and equitable growth.\n\nSince joining the Fed, I have had the opportunity to see some of these issues play out in communities throughout our District. This has been through conversations with community leaders who we have met at the Fed and through tours of the District. And what I have learned from these experiences reflects many of the themes in the Shared Prosperity book and the topics of tonight’s discussion.\n\nShared Prosperity in America’s Communities provides important insights on the intersection of geography and opportunity. This helps us understand the cost of inequality. And that cost is great.\n\nRaj Chetty, one of the book’s contributors, suggests that a child born into the bottom quintile of income distribution, has a 7.5 percent chance of reaching the top quintile in the United States. He says, “Improving opportunities for children from disadvantaged families to succeed should be a priority for policy makers not just because it is one of the core principles of American society but also because improving mobility can have substantial economic payoffs.”\n\nI agree with Raj. It’s not only in the name of justice and fairness that we should focus on this topic. It’s also because this is an economically smart thing to do. These issues are of particular importance here in the City of Philadelphia, given the demographics that I am sure you are all familiar with today.\n\nDespite signs of economic growth and progress, Philadelphia is still the second-poorest large city in America, with a poverty rate of 26.5 percent, according to the latest U.S. Census figures. Philadelphia also has the highest deep poverty rate of the nation’s 10 most populous cities.\n\nWhile Philadelphia has experienced recent job growth, the rate of growth has been slower than other U.S. cities. Also, the jobs are predominantly low wage and perpetuate ― rather than reverse ― the cycle of poverty.\n\nWe are lucky to have two of the book’s authors here tonight:\n\nWe also have two leaders in attendance from our local community who will discuss the implications of inequality for the City of Philadelphia. They are:\n\nAs I approach policy decisions, it is discussions such as the one tonight that help me best represent the Third District in Washington, D.C. The topics, research, and personal stories add a human element to the data I review each day.\n\nThat said, it is important to have forums where research can inform practice and practice can inform research. This book is an illustration of that approach, and I hope we can continue working together.\n\nThank you for joining us here tonight and for your continued efforts to achieve economic growth and stability in our region.\n\nI will now hand the discussion over to Theresa Singleton, vice president of Community Development Studies & Education Department at the Fed and the moderator for tonight’s conversation.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nGood evening. It is a pleasure and a privilege to have the opportunity to engage with the distinguished gathering of financial professionals and leaders that Money Marketeers represents.\n\nThank you, Guy Haselmann, a proud Fightin' Blue Hen from the University of Delaware, for the invitation.\n\nOverview\n\nI am going to spend my time this evening talking about the prospects of long-term economic growth in the U.S. and the role of economic policies — monetary policy included — in affecting those prospects. But before I start, let me say that my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAs you know, the recovery from the end of the Great Recession was slow, with the pace of business fixed investment and job growth remaining modest for some time. Thankfully, job growth accelerated over the past 18 months, but the pace of business fixed investment still remains modest.1 And while the unemployment rate has fallen to levels that are seemingly consistent with full employment, this occurred in tandem with a decline in the labor force participation rate.\n\nThe ratio of employment to working-age population has yet to recover to its precrisis level. Looking forward, our forecasts of real economic growth over the next two to three years remain subdued.\n\nWhat is the underlying cause of this slow economic growth? One possibility is that recovery from the wrenching global financial crisis we experienced in 2008–2009 is a slow process.\n\nThere is merit to this view: Economists tell us that a recovery from a bad financial crisis can take a long time, as long as seven years on average.2 So, it is possible that what we are experiencing is one of these slow recoveries. In this case, a pickup in the rate of economic growth may be around the corner as the shock of the Great Recession fades away.\n\nBut for this evening, I am going to be a dismal economist and entertain the possibility that economic growth may remain sluggish for some time to come. I am going to speculate on why that might be the case and what policymakers can do to improve the economy's growth prospects.\n\nOne topic that I will spend a few minutes on is the important role our education sector plays in promoting long-run economic growth. As you know, I have spent most of my career engaged — at various levels — in the delivery of higher education. This has now become a significant national policy issue, garnering great debate about whether the sector is keeping up in a world driven by rapid global integration and disruptive technological change. It is also an issue that concerns the Fed because of its connection to the problem of nonperforming student loans.\n\nLet me say right off the bat that the long-term growth performance of our economy is a very big deal. For example, you must all be aware of how scary the current projections regarding Medicare and Medicaid look. If these expenditure trends are combined with a significant drop off in the rate of GDP growth, the day when investors begin to seriously worry about the return on U.S. Treasury securities will be upon us sooner rather than later.3\n\nEurope's sovereign debt crisis should stand as a stark reminder of what can happen to a nation's borrowing capacity when investors begin to lose confidence in the government's ability to pay its bills.\n\nTechnology and Capital\n\nLet me first talk about what we know about the basic determinants of long-run economic growth, which I will take this evening to mean sustained growth in the material standard of living for ordinary people. There is a great deal of scholarship on this topic by both economists and historians. In an accounting sense, it all comes down to two factors: technology and capital.\n\nBy technology, I mean our continually improving ability to produce existing goods and services at lower cost as well as our ability to invent new products that satisfy previously unmet human needs. Historically, the trend toward greater and greater efficiency has been intimately tied to advances in science, engineering, and medicine.\n\nI will not say much more about this trend this evening because I don't see any slowing in the speed with which the frontiers of human knowledge are expanding. If anything, new territories for scientific exploration are opening up at a faster pace than ever before. So, if we are hunting for the causes of slow economic growth, this is not where we should be looking.\n\nSo, let me then turn to the other factor: \"capital.\" Thanks to Thomas Piketty's recent book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, capital is now a fashionable word. But I am going to use it in the prosaic way economists normally use it: It's the total of the myriad investments businesses, people, and governments made in the past to turn productive knowledge into actual stuff. The existing stocks of equipment, structures, and software are well-known examples of capital in this sense. I will call all of this \"business capital.\"\n\nThere is also another form of capital — embodied in people — that is also very important: This is the time and resources that a worker spends in acquiring knowledge in a specific field — say nursing or auto repair — and the resources that businesses spend to provide on-the-job training to workers. We call all of this \"human capital.\" Economic growth, which is measured as growth in the GDP per worker, results from growth in technological efficiency and growth in the stocks of business and human capital per worker.\n\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy on Long-Term Economic Growth\n\nAll of this should be familiar territory. But let's think what this accounting means for monetary policy. How does monetary policy affect long-run economic growth? Well, its effects can only enter via the calculus that determines how much firms invest in business capital and how much firms and people invest in human capital. This makes sense. As monetary policymakers, we affect interest rates in financial markets, and rates of investments depend on interest rates.\n\nBut economists tell us that over the long haul, these rates of investments cannot be affected much by monetary policy, if monetary policy succeeds in keeping inflationary expectations and actual inflation stable and equal to each other.\n\nIn this happy scenario, interest rates in financial markets will, on average, be just right to neutralize the rise in prices. The fact of inflation, then, will be unimportant to the investment decisions people and businesses make.\n\nSo, this is the first point I want to make this evening. Good monetary policy — meaning monetary policy that delivers on our price stability mandate — by virtue of it being good, will not affect long-term economic growth. Of course, it goes without saying that bad monetary policy can derail the economy and reduce economic growth.\n\nHere's another way to put it: There is a growth potential out there, and the best that monetary policy can do is to help achieve that potential, but it cannot affect the potential itself. So, there are limits to the effectiveness of monetary policy that we must be careful to respect. In real time, it is always a challenge to determine if the economy is at its growth potential or if it is operating above or below it. This uncertainty is at the heart of the genuine disagreements that members of the FOMC can have regarding the stance of policy.\n\nNow that I have emphasized the limits of monetary policy, let me now emphasize that there is plenty of scope for economic policies — broadly interpreted — to improve the long-run performance of the U.S. economy. So, if long-term economic growth is a concern, there is a great deal that policy- and lawmakers can do to make our economy function more productively and to cause economic growth to pick up.\n\nDeterminants of Economic Growth\n\nTo put my thoughts here in some order, I wish to say more about the determinants of long-term economic growth. The two factors I mentioned a few minutes ago — technology and capital — are great starting points if the goal is to measure the contribution of different factors in accounting for economic growth.\n\nFor instance, this accounting tells us that a country with a low standard of living must have inferior business technology and low levels of business and human capital. This is a start, surely, but the accounting does not tell us why this is the case.\n\nIt turns out that the why remains a bit of a mystery, although much has been said and written about it. For my purposes, I will call this final determinant of economic growth \"fair competition.\" By this I mean an environment in which the economic playing field is level and in which every individual and business has a decent shot at economic success.\n\nYou should have no trouble recognizing this final determinant. In this country, we call it \"the American Dream.\" Economists, as usual, have a more prosaic word for it; they call it the \"free enterprise system.\" They have taught us that barriers to free enterprise are the main reasons why many countries remain mired in poverty.\n\nThe technical knowledge needed to improve the standard of living is available — typically freely — but institutions that support fair competition are lacking in many countries. And the incentives to improve technology and to invest in business and human capital are seriously blunted. So, it is the combination of technology, capital, and fair competition that keeps the economic engine running in good order. If you think in these terms, you will know where economic policy fits into the big growth picture; it fits in primarily to ensure fair competition.\n\nThis is a fairly abstract view of economic policies, but if you think of some of the landmark laws in this country — antitrust laws, insider-trading laws, and IP protection laws, for instance — you would agree that it is a point of view that resonates. You might even argue that our Founding Fathers devised our Constitution to ensure fair competition. But let me give you an example of another sort of policy, one that casts a different light on the idea of fair competition.\n\nWe live in an increasingly globalized world, and one facet of competition is the competition between nation states. Countries determine national policies to further the welfare of their citizens, but entities in other countries are indirectly affected by these policies. If corporate tax rates are lower in Continental Europe, U.S. businesses have an incentive to locate their profit centers abroad and to \"store\" their foreign earnings abroad, too.\n\nHow should American policymakers respond to these incentives? What does fair competition mean in this instance?\n\nWell, you know how our government responded: by threatening dire consequences for corporations that relocate for tax reasons. But perhaps lawmakers should ask if the problem is just a bunch of errant corporations or if it is a tax code that is not serving the interests our people?\n\nIn this instance, I think fair competition means that our government should compete with other nations to offer a tax code that reduces deadweight losses and improves efficiency.4 We know that our current tax code is far from an optimal one. This is low-hanging fruit. If we can offer a more efficient tax system to our citizens, our economic growth will pick up, for sure.\n\nA Rising Mismatch\n\nI am now going to talk a bit more about economic growth and human capital because this is a topic that is close to my heart and because it may hold a key to our slow growth.\n\nAs you are aware, there is lot of anxiety regarding the economic prospects of our young people. If your children are adolescents or young adults, you may personally relate to this anxiety. Economists tell us that the college premium has risen substantially over the past three decades.\n\nA worker who has a high school degree at most can expect to earn substantially less than a worker with some college under his or her belt. At the same time, although more and more high school graduates are attempting to attend college, the fraction earning a college degree has not risen much at all. This results in college completion rates that decline over time.5 This leaves more young people saddled with college loan debt, no degree, and without a higher-paying job to help pay off the loan.\n\nThis issue has led our administration to call for efforts to improve college completion rates as well as the access to, and the quality of, a college education. They hope that such initiatives will help more young adults find gainful employment in an increasingly knowledge-based economy.\n\nThe trend of a declining college completion rate is troubling on several dimensions. For instance, why are more students dropping out when there is much to be gained from earning a degree?\n\nOne reason could be that the average high school curriculum is not rigorous enough to prepare students for college. One can observe this possibility by looking at the nation's low proficiency levels in reading and math among 17-year-olds. Another reason could be that many students who pursue a college degree do not feel — rightly or wrongly — that the average curriculum will help them find future employment.\n\nBe that as it may, the facts seem to be pointing to a rising mismatch between what our education sector offers to students and the skills, training, and knowledge our business sector needs more and more. And this disparity can have a significant impact on the overall health of our economy. But the word \"mismatch\" suggests that businesses always know the kind of workers they want but cannot find them. Is there any evidence of this? Certainly, there is anecdotal evidence.\n\nI have heard employers complain about vacancies they cannot fill because of the lack of a qualified applicant pool. So, perhaps we need to try new ways of addressing this issue. For instance, in South Carolina, regional manufacturing firms came together — out of need — to develop the Apprentice2000 program that trains young adults in Mechatronics, a multidisciplinary field of engineering.\n\nThese apprenticeship programs that combine some study with on-the-job training have a significant impact on the lives of workers and the economy but have had a limited application here in the United States. They are far more prevalent abroad.\n\nIn an assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Registered Apprenticeship program in 10 states, Mathematica Policy Research estimated that, on average, those who completed a Registered Apprenticeship program — versus those who did not — could expect to be compensated around $250,000 more over their lifetime, including benefits.6 We can and should expand upon these programs. So, I think the mismatch between what our education sector offers and what employers need is indeed real. And it is probably one reason why our economic growth has been slow in coming out of the Great Recession.\n\nHere is the problem: Economists tell us that a mismatch between supply and demand for a particular good, service, or skill should not be a cause for concern. In a market-based economy, mismatches work themselves out through changes in prices that elicit the appropriate responses in demand and supply. But the education sector is unique in this regard.\n\nIt is surely at the heart of a knowledge-based economy that is not set up to respond swiftly to changes in business demands for new and old skills. This is especially true when these changes are not marginal in nature.\n\nEven when a specific skill set is in demand, and a change in curriculum occurs to meet this, there is significant lag time involved in producing a pipeline of graduates who have acquired these skills.\n\nSeparately, reflect for a moment on the fact that it is only very recently that the U.S. Department of Education made detailed earnings information for college graduates publicly available. Until this change, prospective students could not compare the cost of attending a college with the benefits of doing so.\n\nWhere there is a lack of information regarding the return on this investment that colleges offer, there is a weakened connection with how we make sure workplaces get the skills they need. It is critical that this changes in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, policymakers can reevaluate priorities and ensure that our education policies provide a proper supporting role to the adjustments that need to be made. I see this falling within the scope of fair competition, where the word \"fair\" takes on an added meaning and urgency. When a large swath of young adults is increasingly ill equipped to have a decent shot at economic success, we risk failure on a massive scale.\n\nClosing\n\nThis brings me to the end of my talk. I have covered a fair bit of ground with you, so let me wrap up by summarizing my main points. First, I think that long-term economic growth is fundamental to our future economic well-being. Economic growth has slowed since the mid-1990s, and we may remain on a slow growth trajectory for some time to come.\n\nI talked to you about what we know of the determinants of long-run economic growth, and I stressed that monetary policy that successfully delivers on price stability with maximum employment can affect these factors only marginally. Thus, there are limits to what good monetary policy can do for us.\n\nSecond, I think there is a lot that can be done in the policy space to improve the prospects of long-term economic growth. Reform of the corporate tax system — to bring it more in line with the tax systems of our main competitors — is one area where I think progress is possible.\n\nAlso, I believe our education sector plays a critical role in our nation's economic growth. It is a sector I know quite well, and I am concerned that, without a clear understanding of the return on investment of a college degree, we are not well adapted to deal with a rapidly globalizing world and fast-paced technological change.\n\nFinally, I mentioned some initiatives that businesses and government have taken to remedy the growing mismatch between the offerings of the education sector and the demands of business. I think these are good beginnings, but, with help of policy and lawmakers, more can be done.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Nonfarm payroll employment accelerated from a 1.65 percent pace in 2013 to 1.88 percent in 2014 and 2.05 percent in 2015. In contrast, nonresidential fixed investment grew 3.03 percent in 2013, accelerated to 6.15 percent in 2014 but slowed again in 2015 to 2.86 percent.\n\n[2]Averaging more than 24 episodes of major financial crises (not including the most recent one), the number of years for per capita output to recover its precrisis level is 7.2 years (Carmen M. Reinhart and K. Rogoff, This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton University Press, 2009, Figure 14.7). U.S. GDP per capita barely surpassed its precrisis level in 2014 — seven years since the onset of the crisis in 2007. Scaled by growth in nominal GDP per capita, the value of CoreLogic HPI in 2015 has now recovered to its 2002 level, arguably the last year before the housing boom was underway. Thus, the sector at the center of the financial crisis has also just reached normalcy.\n\n[3]According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), under current law the federal debt for 2040 is projected to be 107 percent of GDP. If productivity growth is 0.5 percentage point lower than the baseline projection of 1.3 percent per year, the projected federal debt would rise to 125 percent of GDP (CBO, Long-Term Budget Outlook, June 2015, Figure 7–3, p. 98).\n\n[4]The U.S.’s top corporate income tax rate of 39 percent is the highest among Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Excluding the U.S., the average top corporate income tax rate among OECD countries is 25 percent. Among European OECD countries, the average top corporate income tax rate is 24 percent (OECD Tax Database, Table II.1, May 2015).\n\n[5]See John Bound, Michael F.

            "content": "Good morning. It is always great to be back on a college campus. I have spent 30 years of my career on university campuses, and nothing matches their innovation and knowledge creation anywhere. As it was for the time I served as the University of Delaware’s president, it is an honor to be here today and once again to be part of an event that has been a great source of pride for the college over the past decade.\n\nI would like to thank David Lyons and the University of Delaware's Center for Economic Education & Entrepreneurship for inviting me here today.\n\nI would also like to congratulate Dean Weber and the Alfred Lerner College of Business & Economics. Its JPMorgan Chase Innovation Center was recently selected by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business — the AACSB — as an award-winning example of where “inspirational work is being done by business schools around the world.” Garnering such an award in competition with so many strong and well-resourced peer business schools is the result of the outstanding efforts of many people at the University of Delaware. So, congratulations again.\n\nAn Economic Outlook\n\nToday I would like to offer my views on the economic outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy and to discuss what I am sure are the issues on all of your minds: interest rates and the path they are on, how we can get to full economic health, and what approach we should consider to make full use of our District’s incredible potential.\n\nAs always, my views are mine alone and do not reflect those of my colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAfter expressing my views on our nation’s economic health and prospects, I would like to offer a few observations about the economic conditions a bit closer to home, concentrating on what I believe are the inherent strengths and challenges in Delaware’s economy.\n\nThen, I would like to take a few minutes to address my stance on monetary policy based on my assessment of inflation and economic activity over the coming year. If the economy evolves in a materially different way from what I anticipate, my policy views would likewise change.\n\nAs Chair Janet Yellen and many of my colleagues have emphasized, I likewise view decisions about economic policy as data dependent, meaning that as we review the data coming in, our opinions about the appropriate timing of normalization shift appropriately. Furthermore, the conversations and interactions we have every day in the communities we serve also factor into these decisions.\n\nAn Economic Snapshot\n\nDespite a fairly weak fourth quarter when real GDP increased by a paltry 0.7 percent, I remain upbeat. Economic fundamentals are sound, and our financial system is in good shape. Labor markets remain dynamic, income growth is solid, and consumer spending continues to increase at a solid pace.\n\nIf there is anything that I believe would pose any risk to the forecast I will deliver, it would be the recent events on Wall Street coupled with the strong dollar and weakening growth in China. The effects that these developments may have on the U.S. economy are something that we continue to watch closely.\n\nEmployment\n\nI am stepping into the Fed at a time when our business climate maintains a steady and gradual improvement, and though challenges remain, we continue making strides.\n\nRobust employment growth, increased disposable income, and fairly healthy household balance sheets should cause consumption to grow in the coming year by 2.7 percent, and it is the consumer who will underpin the economic progress in my forecast.\n\nOne of the fundamental strengths supporting this economic growth will be the continued strength in job growth.\n\nEach of the past three years has witnessed the creation of more than 2 million net new jobs, and many of these jobs were in high-skilled professions. Although I expect that employment growth will slow somewhat, I am still expecting a year when the economy creates in the neighborhood of 2 million net new jobs.\n\nThe number of job openings remains high, and in my meetings around the District, I often hear leaders lament about the difficulty in finding the right workers. The latest employment report for January is broadly consistent with that expectation.\n\nAs job growth continues, labor market slack will diminish. I, therefore, anticipate stronger wage growth than the 2 percent or so that we achieved last year.\n\nI also believe that we will see more people return to the labor market and that the participation rate will rise modestly to around 63 percent.\n\nOur participation rate was hit hard by the recession, but it is a number that is also heavily influenced by demographics and social shifts as well as by the number of discouraged workers. For instance, in the 1960s and ’70s, women entered the workforce in greater numbers, so we saw the participation rate spike. While 63 percent is still low by historical standards, the participation rate has been trending down for some time. Although I believe we will see a small cyclical uptick, the strength in job growth could bring the unemployment rate down to 4.7 percent by year-end.\n\nEquity Markets\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, equity markets have been extremely volatile as of late, and we have seen a large sell-off and close to a 10 percent drop in equity prices.\n\nMuch of the current unease we are experiencing could be due in part to worry regarding China. Taken together, slower Chinese growth and declining share values embeds some downside risk to my assessment of future economic activity.\n\nThat said, China is not our major trading partner, and it may well be that as the U.S. economy proves its resilience, equity markets are expected to calm down and reverse direction.\n\nI do anticipate that the loss in wealth arising from the dramatic sell-off will offset some of our economy’s fundamental strength, but I do not feel it will overwhelm it. Thus, although declines in asset prices have tempered the view I had of the economy a few months ago, the recent declines have not fundamentally changed it. As a policymaker, I think it is important to take a long-term view rather than react to short-term volatility and, thus, to consider an array of data and longer-term trends in forming our policy stance.\n\nReal Estate\n\nSwitching to real estate, I am fairly optimistic about residential investment. The demand for housing has picked up, and prices of both houses and especially rentals are growing strongly.\n\nPermits for single-family homes are at their highest level since the recovery began, and plans for building in the multifamily sector remain robust. That underlying strength was also reflected in December’s healthy report on new single-family homes that grew by 544,000 at an annualized rate — the strongest performance since February 2015.\n\nNonresidential investment is a bit more problematic, however. I say this because I feel it is unlikely that we will see strong growth in business fixed investments — such as new structures, equipment, and software — due in part to the strong dollar adversely affecting manufacturing, and therefore, the demand for equipment. That said, I foresee manufacturers continuing to struggle in the coming year and anticipate investment growth of only 2.5 percent or so.\n\nInflation\n\nLet me now turn to another important component of the U.S. economy that significantly influences monetary policy, and that is inflation. As you know, inflation continued to run below the FOMC’s 2 percent target in 2015. Both the fall in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, the appreciation of the dollar, have held down headline inflation, or total inflation, which includes commodities such as food and energy prices.\n\nInflation measures that remove these more volatile components are not far from our goal of 2 percent. I believe that once energy prices stabilize and start reversing, inflation will return to our 2 percent target. I see headline inflation accelerating at an annual average pace of 1.5 percent by the second half of this year.\n\nBut as Chair Yellen has emphasized, inflation expectations are also a crucial ingredient in formulating monetary policy, and she has noted that “[c]onvincing evidence that longer-run inflation expectations have moved lower would be a concern.” This is because that would make attaining our inflation target harder to achieve.\n\nSo far, survey evidence, like that obtained from the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, does not indicate any unanchoring of inflation expectations. However, market-based measures are showing that investors are seeking less compensation for inflation.\n\nBut there are downside risks to my baseline forecast. In particular, we have been below our inflation target for all but two years since 2008. Consistently below-target outcomes will eventually lead to a lack of credibility for our 2 percent goal. Hence, it may be worth erring on the side of accommodation to ensure against that outcome.\n\nHowever, there are also risks to the upside. There is a good deal of anecdotal evidence that firms are planning to raise wages, especially for jobs that are proving to be hard to fill. I do expect some faster wage growth going forward, and accelerating wage growth could translate into more robust inflation. Additionally, it is unlikely that oil prices will continue to drop, and eventually, they will become a contributor rather than a detractor from inflation.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nMy approach to policy is to conduct it in ways that will best serve our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.\n\nGiven the behavior of oil prices, inflation is likely to be quite low in the first quarter of the year, probably even negative. Regarding the employment side of our mandate, I believe we will attain it early this year, if we have not attained it already.\n\nOver the medium term, I remain confident that inflation will return to target. Arithmetic is in our favor: Energy prices would need to fall again and, by a similar magnitude, to renew their downward pressure on inflation. In other words, even if energy prices remain at very low levels, inflation should naturally rebound as current prices become the base on which price increases are computed.\n\nSimilarly, import prices should stabilize as the dollar does, removing another source of downward pressure on inflation. Granted, this process will take some time as the price cuts are transmitted across the economy. Thus, my outlook sees inflation returning to target only gradually, more gradually than I thought just a few months ago.\n\nIt is also fair to say that the risks to my outlook are tilted to the downside. The nervousness in the financial markets and the increased caution that it may cause for economic decision-makers, both households and firms, could imply somewhat slower growth, at least in the first half of the year.\n\nAlso, inflation is not likely to pick up substantially until the second half of the year, although, for the reasons I have discussed, I remain confident that inflation will move toward the Committee’s long-run objective of 2 percent.\n\nThese considerations make me a bit more conservative in my approach to policy, at least in the very near term. Although I cannot give you a definitive path for how policy will evolve, it might prove prudent to wait until the inflation data are stronger before we undertake a second rate hike. Thus, I am approaching near-term policy a bit more cautiously than I did a few months ago. That is part of being data dependent. And attentiveness to the data will be a key factor in all of my future policy recommendations as well. If financial headwinds dissipate quickly and inflation picks up a bit more aggressively, it will require a slightly more aggressive approach to policy.\n\nI believe as we move into the second half of the year with economic activity growing at trend or slightly above trend, the unemployment rate below its natural rate, and price pressures starting to assert themselves, policy can truly normalize. I mean this in the sense that we can move away meaningfully from the zero lower bound and that our reaction to incoming data can return to a more historical pattern.\n\nThat would not necessarily imply an overly aggressive path for policy. Thus, it will take fewer rate hikes to attain neutrality in policy than it would have 15 years ago. By historical standards, that in itself implies a somewhat shallower path for interest rates than was typical of past recoveries.\n\nDelaware\n\nSo, what does this all mean for our District and its challenges? As we know, Delaware is fighting to maintain its edge in attracting and retaining corporate headquarters in the state. The recent loss of DuPont represents a stark reminder of a shrinking corporate sector. Fortunately, we have seen rapid growth in education and health services, and the state’s thought leaders have their sights focused on innovation.\n\nWe can look to the opening of the University of Delaware’s STAR Campus as an example of how this region knows how to combine its strengths of the public and private sectors to grow and shape the economy of the 21st century.\n\nUniversities like the University of Delaware fuel innovations that shape modern life, from life-saving medicines to life-changing technology. And so, in 2008, when the Chrysler plant finally closed and left behind an aged industrial complex — a reminder of our District’s past — we chose to invest our expertise and resources to build what now stands there and represents our future.\n\nWe recycled 140 million pounds of steel, 5,000 tons of concrete, 40,000 light bulbs, and almost 4 million pounds of copper, aluminum, and stainless steel.\n\nToday, more than 400 patients a week come to STAR’s health centers, and thriving inside is a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation. Cybersecurity, Bloom Energy, SevOne, and grid-integrated vehicle systems are being worked on over there. There is a lab focused on providing kids with disabilities the mobility they need to socialize, learn, and grow. Please excuse my excitement; after all, I am an engineer. But what I am trying to drive home, in this room filled with all kinds of leaders, is that the investment we all make in human capital, research, and innovation will never stop giving. It will keep us relevant, it will create jobs, and it will sustain our economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, in closing, my overall view of the economy remains upbeat. Our financial system is in good shape, our economic fundamentals are sound, our labor markets remain dynamic, our income growth is solid, and consumer spending is increasing at a solid pace. We continue to face our challenges head on, and in doing so, we have made significant economic strides as a nation.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to the 11th Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum. This is my first Policy Forum as President and CEO, and I have been looking forward to it since joining the Bank in July.\n\nOur Policy Forums are held only once every two years. They provide a unique opportunity to bring together some of the most renowned leaders in economic research and focus on long-term issues and their implications for monetary policy.\n\nAs someone who has spent much of his career at academic institutions, I am particularly thrilled to lead an organization that provides a forum for the sort of wide-ranging discussions and debates we will hear today.\n\nI want to thank Mike Dotsey, director of research, and his staff for organizing today’s program. They have brought together an all-star lineup of thought leaders from across the country. I am excited for you to hear them and so appreciative that they could join us.\n\nOur theme today is “The New Normal for the U.S. Economy.” What is the “new normal”? As the saying goes, “It depends who you ask.” But I believe most would agree that the question is complex and that there is scope for different viewpoints. Today, we will hear several views on the U.S. economy’s current and long-term economic prospects.\n\nOur goal is to delve into some of the different issues and perspectives that are influencing our nation’s economic growth. We will cover a wide range of topics, broadly divided into three areas that have an impact on our economy: technology/innovation, social factors, and monetary policy.\n\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, economist Leonard Nakamura has been researching how the evolution of information and communication technology is creating measurement issues for our statistics. One example is that some innovations, such as free apps and social media, are widely used but may not generate revenue, at least not right away. Leonard calls this URL — “Ubiquity now, Revenue Later.”\n\nIn a “URL world,” is productivity growth truly as low as it appears in the official statistics? It is possible that new disruptors to the economy, like free apps and social media are making our progress harder to capture in current economic measures. This is a special concern for monetary policy because it is possible that we are not fully capturing rising quality in our price measures and that inflation is even lower than we think it is.\n\nThese issues have a direct bearing on the conduct of monetary policy. This is why today’s discussions on the economic impact of technology and innovation are relevant for central bankers. I am honored to welcome Robert Gordon and Joel Mokyr from Northwestern University, and Erik Brynjolfsson, whose book The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies was one of the highlights of my summer reading.\n\nI am also very pleased to have leaders like Daron Acemoglu, Darrell West, and Eric Hanushek with us to address issues surrounding immigration and income inequality.\n\nAll of these issues have critical implications for the new normal. Our day will conclude with thoughts on monetary policy from two of my respected colleagues: James Bullard, President of the St. Louis Fed, and Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Minneapolis Fed. Narayana has served the Federal Reserve with great distinction for the past six years. It has been a pleasure getting to know him, and I want to wish him the best for his future endeavors.\n\nWe all know that what the new normal will mean ultimately depends on the growth rate of worker productivity, the key determinant of our standard of living. Most of you are familiar with Paul Krugman’s statement that while “Productivity isn’t everything, but in the long run it is almost everything.”\n\nThe recent slowdown in productivity growth and the continuing downshift in labor force growth are prominently influencing our views of the new normal. But trends are not destiny — or at least they needn’t be. The growth rate of productivity is influenced by a range of factors, many of which we can influence. These include the rate of discovery of new knowledge, the incentives for businesses to adopt new technologies and to provide the needed on-the-job training for their workers, the effectiveness of our educational institutions in providing formal schooling, and the growth in the size of our domestic and international markets. Last but not least, it also includes the whole gamut of economic policies that interact with all of those factors.\n\nOur nation’s growth is one of the most important issues we face as policymakers. We know that incremental changes in the standard of living will determine our future prosperity. We need to be thinking about what we can do to positively influence growth rates five, 10, and 15 years down the road.\n\nWhile prospects for long-term growth in the United States remain solid, the medium-term outlook has been revised downward in recent years. My view, which is my own and not necessarily that of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), is that we will see steady and modest growth going forward.\n\nGDP growth has averaged 2.2 percent since the Great Recession ended in June 2009, and the most recent FOMC projections show the central tendency for long-term growth to be in the 1.8 to 2.2 percent range. Economic fundamentals have been improving, and we are approaching normalcy.\n\nAccordingly, I would like to see rates raised sooner rather than later. With an early start, we can better ensure that monetary accommodation is removed gradually and that inflation returns to the Fed’s 2 percent target smoothly. My fear is that the Federal Reserve risks losing its credibility and only adds uncertainty to the economic landscape the longer the Committee waits to begin normalizing policy.\n\nTherefore, raising rates this year will, in my view, serve to reduce monetary policy uncertainty and to keep the economy on track for sustained growth with price stability.\n\nOne of the highlights of my first four months at the Fed has been the opportunity to meet with people across the District. I have heard firsthand about small business challenges, innovative community programs, new housing models, and much more. People’s pride, commitment, and resilience are empowering. As someone who has dedicated much of his life to education and developing our future leaders, I am inspired by the great potential I see.\n\nOur challenge is to ensure that we have the resources, the vision, and the leadership to make full use of our District’s potential.\n\nWe don’t know exactly what tomorrow will look like, but we do know it will be different. We need to stay attuned to, and ahead of, those changes.\n\nI think you can see why I am so excited to have you here in Philadelphia for today’s program. I hope that it raises many questions and inspires more discussion and research on these pressing issues.\n\nThank you for joining us. I look forward to the presentations and the discussions they will generate. Please enjoy today’s program.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Introduction\n\nThank you for attending today’s conference. I am glad to see so many here for a discussion on what I view as a pressing issue not only in our region but throughout the United States. Today, we will look at some of the promising new approaches and emerging strategies for addressing youth unemployment. In particular, we will look at how apprenticeships and employer-led strategies can bolster our efforts in this area.\n\nI want to first thank our speakers who will be sharing their expertise on youth employment and the policy, research, and practice perspectives associated with this issue.\n\nThanks also to our cosponsors, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and The Annie E. Casey Foundation. I would like to point out some of the important work these organizations are doing in this field:\n\nFinally, I would like to thank Theresa Singleton and her community development team from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for organizing today’s event.\n\nA Focus on Employment\n\nThe idea of promoting maximum employment has always been part of the Federal Reserve’s mission. This concept was formalized in 1977 when Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act, establishing what is now commonly referred to as the Fed’s dual mandate: to achieve price stability and to promote maximum, sustainable employment. There are various ways in which we contribute to this objective of maximum employment.\n\nThe Research functions across the Federal Reserve System are an important source of data and analysis on labor market issues, and we can be a resource for organizations that provide meaningful programs for the unemployed. And a significant amount of activity has occurred in the System’s community development function:\n\nHere at the Philadelphia Fed, our staff has been particularly focused on workforce-related challenges, issues, and opportunities for young people between the ages of 16 and 24. The decrease in labor force participation among young people in recent years has been striking, declining from about 66 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2015.2\n\nWe recognize that while much of the economy has rebounded in recent years, significant barriers still exist for young people in the job market. This is especially true for those young people who are currently disconnected, which is to say that they are neither employed nor in school. This population is also increasingly referred to as opportunity youth because they represent an untapped resource in our nation’s economy. Measure of America, a project of the nonprofit Social Science Research Council, reported that close to 14 percent of Americans between the ages of 16 and 24 are disconnected and that these rates are higher for minority youths. More than one-fifth of all African American youths and more than 16 percent of all Latino youths are disconnected.\n\nThese numbers point to an urgent need for communities to make efforts to engage these young people, in particular. We’re fortunate in Philadelphia to have several organizations doing tremendous work. I have had the privilege of recently touring the facilities of the YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School, Philadelphia Works, and District 1199C Training & Upgrading Fund. In their own unique ways, these organizations are focused on reengaging young people in this region and in helping them learn job skills and in finding meaningful work. While each organization is unique in its approach, common threads still exist among them. These organizations are successful, in large part, because they realize that their work goes far beyond job training. There is a personal aspect to their work that is critical to their efforts. They offer a sense of belonging, a sense of direction, and even a sense of family to those who lack these necessities in their personal lives. Also, by way of their investments in the lives of these youths, these organizations and programs are having an important and positive impact on the future regional economy.\n\nFor each of us, one person entrusted us with our first job. This person made an investment in us that is still yielding outcomes today. For me, I benefited greatly from having work opportunities at an early age. At 14, I started working on a farm near my hometown in New Jersey. And I can tell you that I learned things from my first job and from my first boss, John McGroarty, that I still reflect on to this day. While much of farming seems routine, trust me, it takes a lot of creativity and tenacity to catch pigs that have escaped from their sty.\n\nStarting to work at an early age taught me many skills that could be easily transferred to any job, and these skills made it easier for me when I started my career in earnest years later. Getting a feel for a professional environment at an early age was invaluable. I learned that if you work hard and show a desire to expand your knowledge, new opportunities can and do arise. And, perhaps most importantly, John taught me the value of having a mentor. I worked for John and his family for more than eight years. Over the course of my career, I have been very fortunate to have had several mentors, such as my father-in-law, along the way. Each one invested significantly in my development. Looking back at my career path as I wrote today’s remarks, I was struck by how important mentorship was to me and for others entering the workforce. This is true for formal apprenticeships and the more informal interactions that occur when adults make personal investments of their time in young people. The investment John made in me 40 years ago has had a tremendous impact on where and who I am today.\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe problem we face is that too few young people are securing the types of job opportunities many of us had. Too many young people are not engaged in work or education — they are not connected — and this can set them back for the rest of their lives. Research shows that when young people are not active in work or school, they fail to develop adequate professional skills, and they ultimately have lower earnings over a lifetime. Given the significant role of consumer spending in the economy, this disengagement of young people from the labor market can also have lasting impact on local and regional economic growth.\n\nWe know that education contributes to an individual’s future earnings, but work experience matters as well. The Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs conducted a survey of young workers\nthat confirmed the importance of work experience and early entry into the workforce. Survey respondents who had a paid job during high school were more likely to be currently working than those who did not.\n\nThis survey of young workers indicated that some of the difficulties young people face when looking for a job are felt even more acutely by low-income and minority individuals. Many of these individuals are ambitious young people who are eager to join the workforce, but obstacles in the way can become insurmountable without proper support systems.\n\nNew Perspectives, New Partners, New Pathways\n\nThe issues facing disconnected youth are complex, and the barriers are real, as many in this audience can attest. We are all here today because we recognize the need for new perspectives, new partners, and new pathways for young people.\n\nApprenticeships\n\nApprenticeships offer one way to broaden access to training and employment. Apprenticeships have been the staple of workforces throughout modern history. George Washington was an apprentice surveyor, and Ben Franklin was an apprentice printer.\n\nApprentices receive structured on-the-job training, wages, industry-recognized credentials, and direct access to jobs and careers. Employers, in turn, obtain highly trained employees and increased productivity; they may also have a better experience in retaining employees.\n\nIn an assessment and cost-benefit analysis of the Registered Apprenticeship — or RA — program in 10 states, Mathematica Policy Research conducted a study and noted that RA participants had substantially higher earnings than nonparticipants. The study estimated that apprentices who completed their RA programs would receive an average of around $300,000 more in compensation over their lifetime, including benefits, than nonparticipants.3 These programs can have a significant impact on the lives of workers and the economy; however, they have had limited application here in the United States.\n\nApprenticeships reach approximately 55 to 70 percent of youths in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. As a share of the total labor force, apprenticeships account for just under 4 percent in Australia and Germany, just under 3 percent in the U.K., but only 0.3 percent in the U.S. And, while in most other countries apprenticeships begin after secondary schooling, in the United States, the average age of an RA program participant is now 28 years old. We must consider ways to make it easier for young people to access these programs.\n\nNew Partners\n\nWe realize that it is just as important to engage employers as it is young people. It is important to recognize the needs of employers — to know what they are looking for and to partner with them as we train young people in skills that will translate into careers.\n\nToday, you will hear from several speakers who are working across fragmented systems or silos to create real solutions in our communities. For example, Michael Wiggins is with us today from Southwire — a wire and cable producer in Georgia — that has collaborated with local school districts to develop a program that addresses high drop-out rates and creates a job pipeline for local talent. Southwire’s 12 for Life program blends classroom instruction and on-the-job training. It has been successful in matching talented, ambitious young people with fulfilling careers at the company, and, in turn, it has also helped produce successful members of the workforce.\n\nThe program that you will hear more about from Michael underscores how much more our regions can achieve when employers are actively engaged and when mentors are available and willing to share knowledge.\n\nNew Pathways\n\nLater in the program, you will hear from Simran Sidhu from the YouthBuild Philadelphia Charter School. I had the privilege of meeting with Simran and some of her students last week at YouthBuild. The visit highlighted the importance of career advancement and supporting youth at each transition, whether it is from high school to community college or from community college to a first job. I met with students who said that one of their biggest barriers to success in school was simply not having an adult in their lives who cared. After struggling with reading or math and without the proper support system, they simply withdrew. Simran and her staff focus on giving these individuals the support they need, which goes far beyond job training.\n\nYouthBuild has a wonderful partnership with Starbucks that involves training students to become baristas and then transitioning them into jobs. The technical side of that partnership is going well, and it is something I can personally attest to after being fortunate enough to sample a cup of coffee prepared by the students. But after I spent some time in the school, it became apparent that the program has a far greater impact than simply training future baristas. It is about giving our youth the necessary skills and the vision to see beyond that first job, allowing them to go from being a barista to becoming a store manager or possibly even a district manager. It is about creating a pathway to success through personal contact and professional training programs.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn order to meet the needs of our young people and to secure our long-term economic future, we need to make real investments in their training and employment today. It is key to support these individuals not just as students, but as neighbors, as members of our community, and as part of our economy. This approach will bolster our efforts in helping to put young people on a path of success and in addressing a pressing issue in our regional and local economies.\n\nThe investment that John McGroarty made in me more than 40 years ago has had a profound and lasting impact on my career. As we proceed with today’s critical conversations, I would like to challenge each one of us to consider the investments we are making in our young people today, particularly those who are disconnected. There are many ways we can each be involved, such as through apprenticeships, internships, and mentoring. At the corporate level, we can do even more. It will undoubtedly take new and innovative approaches and collaboration across sectors to create these lasting and essential career pathways for young people. It is a complicated and layered challenge but one that is worth pursuing.\n\nGoing forward, I can see one of my primary focuses will be to explore ways to strengthen the Third District in the area of workforce development. As we deepen our engagement in workforce development issues, we want to hear from you about how we can be most helpful in this space.\n\nThank you again for joining us today and thank you also for the important work you do in our communities.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1] https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports.aspx\n\n[2] The percentages are based on third quarter seasonally adjusted data for the respective years provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n[3] See “An Effectiveness Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis of Registered Apprenticeship in 10 States,” by Mathematica Policy Research, 2012 at http://wdr.doleta.gov.pdf.

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The Philadelphia Fed staff and colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System have had a long relationship with the Global Interdependence Center, or the GIC. For nearly 40 years, Fed policymakers have participated in GIC meetings around the world, sharing interests in many of the economic topics that drive the world's economy.\n\nWe are glad to have the GIC as good neighbors and as colleagues whose good work serves so many around the world.\n\nWe are delighted to provide the venue today for the GIC's conference on Energy Interdependence in the Western Hemisphere. I am particularly pleased to see a combination of engineering and economic perspectives, given my background prior to joining the Philadelphia Fed in July.\n\nMy Ph.D. is in civil and urban engineering, with masters' degrees in engineering and economics, so as you can imagine, today's agenda piqued my interest on a number of fronts. Many of the topics you will be discussing today are at the intersection of energy and the economy, and I would have likely found them on my syllabus for courses in either academic discipline.\n\nThis topic of energy also is important to me because I am a native son of this region, and I have watched as energy has become so important to economic growth here in the Third District. I have served on the operating committee of Select Greater Philadelphia, the marketing arm of our Chamber of Commerce, and I know that companies that want to locate here spend time thinking about the energy issues you will be discussing today.\n\nIn January 2015, the Philadelphia Fed asked manufacturers what effect lower energy prices had on their businesses. Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of the firms reported positive effects, while 16 percent reported negative effects. A majority of manufacturers reported that falling energy prices were lowering the costs of production and increasing sales margins.\n\nI believe the Third District has a role to play in the interdependent world of energy in our Western Hemisphere. Energy has influenced the regional economy in recent years, especially with the Marcellus Shale natural gas fields in Pennsylvania. According to a 2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, Pennsylvania grew from being the tenth largest state for employment in oil and natural gas in 2007 to being the sixth largest state in 2012. It also has had the second-largest employment increase over that same period, second only to Texas.1\n\nYet, we should not oversell its promise. The Philadelphia Fed's regional economic team notes that in our tristate economy, mining has experienced a 6.7 percent annualized job growth rate from December 2007 through December 2014, mostly attributable to the Marcellus Shale boom. But the sector still only represents 0.4 percent — less than one-half of 1 percent — of total employment.\n\nAnd through meetings and studies within our local areas, the Philadelphia Fed's Community Development Studies & Education Department has highlighted the challenges that Marcellus Shale has had on local economies, including housing shortages during the boom years.2\n\nThe robust natural gas drilling that carried this region through the worst of the Great Recession has likely plateaued in the past few years. Yet, with the energy currently in the ground, we know it will be a factor for decades to come as we continue to tap known sources and build the infrastructure to bring natural gas to market and eventually find new ways to use this energy to drive our economy.\n\nWhile at the University of Delaware and before that as dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, I sought opportunities to ensure that these institutions innovated with their communities. At the University of Delaware, we launched several initiatives, including the development of a Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus that has become a center of innovation, focused on research in areas such as health science, cybersecurity, and alternative energy. We also built an Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Laboratory on campus. The 194,000-square-foot laboratory building, which was the first newly constructed laboratory in nearly 20 years on the campus, brings together students and faculty from various disciplines to teach, learn, and conduct research in a collaborative environment about real-world problems, including alternative energy. The building is also home to the University of Delaware Energy Institute, the Delaware Environmental Institute, and the Catalysis Center for Energy Innovation.\n\nWhile not every institution can build a laboratory, I believe that organizations such as the GIC and the Philadelphia Fed can play important roles by convening the right expertise to discuss these issues, to be the laboratory of ideas, if you will.\n\nToday's program is just such an opportunity. You will have an exciting mix of speakers, including the Honorable Carlos I. Giralt-Cabrales, Consul of Mexico in Philadelphia, who will speak this afternoon.\n\nThis morning, you are scheduled to hear from, among others, Philip Rinaldi, CEO of Philadelphia Energy Solutions and chair of the Greater Philadelphia Energy Action Team; Dean Joseph Hughes from the Drexel Institute for Energy and the Environment; and Mine Yücel, senior vice president and director of research for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who has written extensively about energy and the economy.\n\nThis is not the first, or the last, energy cycle for the region. Just remember Titusville, PA, where the first oil well was drilled in 1896, or even earlier, the anthracite mines that fueled the railroads, or even more recently, the refineries that operated in my lifetime along the Delaware River here in Philadelphia. The task for every era is to ensure that we all work together to drive innovation by bringing together the right blend of science, technology, business, and community leaders to foster growth and economic development to use the resources wisely.\n\nWith that, I will turn the podium over to our colleagues at the GIC and hope you enjoy the discussion that will follow. Thank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1] Bureau of Labor Statistics, Monthly Labor Review, February 2014. “The Marcellus Shale gas boom in Pennsylvania: employment and wage trends” available at http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/the-marcellus-shale-gas-boom-in-pennsylvania.htm.\n\n[2] Kelsey, Timothy W., and Thomas B.

            "content": "Thank you for attending this Capital for Communities event exploring pay for success financing.\n\nI would like to thank Inglis and Philanthropy Network Greater Philadelphia for their partnership in planning this event. I would also like to thank the talented speakers who have joined us from near and far to share their insights on pay for success financing, a new tool that has the potential to generate societal cost savings through an evidence-based social investment approach.\n\nLastly, I thank the Community Development Studies & Education Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for organizing today’s event.\n\nAcross the Federal Reserve System, the Community Development function provides research and gathers stakeholders to explore emerging trends and issues in low-income areas throughout the country. We are pleased that our colleagues from other Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors have joined us today.\n\nResearch-informed practice and practice-informed research are key goals of the Community Development Studies & Education Department. Today’s event will highlight pay for success, an emerging model that allows the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to work together to move from good intentions to good outcomes. This model uses metrics that not only track success but also allow us to learn from potential failures. It is wonderful to see practitioners, researchers, and policymakers here today as we explore strategies to support research-informed public investments.\n\nOur Region's Potential\n\nI believe this region has incredible potential. Greater Philadelphia is home to some of the world’s most renowned centers for higher education and cutting-edge applied research. We are seeing connections emerge among these institutions with technology transfer centers, entrepreneurs, and investors working together to reshape our city into a center for innovation. Our region’s economy has been strengthening since the recession, with unemployment in Philadelphia County down to 7.6 percent as of August 2015 from a January 2013 rate of 11.9 percent.1 According to figures from the Economy League of Greater Philadelphia, from 2009 to 2013, Philadelphia experienced new business growth of nearly 9 percent, equating to 2,700 new firms. Additionally, Greater Philadelphia has experienced a surge of 45 percent in international visitors over the past decade. Whether to see the Pope or to attend the upcoming Democratic National Convention, people are coming to Philadelphia and taking advantage of the wide variety of local restaurants, shops, and cultural attractions.\n\nDespite this, not everything in Philadelphia is rosy. We have our share of challenges, too. Philadelphia is the second poorest large city in America, with a poverty rate of 26.5 percent, according to the latest U.S. Census figures. Philadelphia also has the highest deep poverty rate of the nation’s 10 most populous cities; that is, people with an income below half of the poverty line. While Philadelphia has experienced recent job growth, the rate of growth has been slower than that of other U.S. cities, and the jobs are predominantly low-wage jobs that perpetuate rather than reverse the cycle of poverty.\n\nDespite the Philadelphia area being home to a number of leading colleges and universities, only 24 percent of city residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and nearly 20 percent of the adult population does not have a high school diploma, according to the latest U.S. Census figures. Other significant human capital issues plague our region as well. More than 106,000 youths and young adults aged 16 to 24 in Greater Philadelphia are not in school and not working. Philadelphia has one of the highest incarceration rates of any large U.S. city, with 8,300 individuals in the Philadelphia Prison System. Further, these individuals face significant challenges when reentering society, contributing to a costly recidivism problem. A recent report by the Pew Charitable Trusts showed that the City of Philadelphia spends 7 cents out of every tax dollar on holding people in its jails, which is more than it spends on the streets and health departments combined.2 Nearly 60 percent of these prison inmates return to the Philadelphia Prison System within three years of their release. How do we combat this problem? Experts cite supportive housing, mental health and substance abuse services, and workforce reentry as service gaps that directly relate to recidivism.3 As the cost figures in this example show, there is a strong economic case for delivering successful preventative social interventions.\n\nTargeted investments in preventative social services could help our region capture unrealized economic gains by unleashing the full potential of human capital improvements. However, traditional sources of capital to address these problems are limited. We know this capital is unlikely to come from the public sector. Municipal governments are under stress: Revenues are insufficient to cover basic expenditures; the costs associated with debt service, pensions, and other post-employment benefits are consuming a substantial share of scarce resources. And for many cities, the unreserved balance in the general fund provides little financial cushion for the future.4 At the same time, federal government programs are not growing, and the philanthropic sector can only do so much.\n\nPay for success offers a new potential source of investment capital, but as with any proposed solution or program, we need to better understand the nature of our challenges. We also need to assess how this tool can contribute to a vision that is sustainable and inclusive, bringing opportunity to every neighborhood of our city and every city in our region.\n\nA Potential Solution: Pay for Success Finance\n\nThe strength of our economy greatly depends on the skills, ability, and financial stability of our workforce. Investing in human capital is a strategy that can ultimately lead to both improved quality of life and economic growth.\n\nWe are here today to explore a new financing tool that allows for that investment in human capital. This new social finance tool, known as pay for success financing or social impact bonds, has been applied to reducing recidivism and homelessness and improving educational performance and public health. These are all endeavors that, if successful, could lead to higher labor market participation and lower unemployment, and thus promote economic growth.\n\nAfter years of seemingly stagnant results in addressing certain social problems, many people are optimistic that pay for success financing will bring solutions in the form of new capital to support program delivery, improve accountability, and increase rigor in performance measurement. Pay for success financing shifts the risk of a preventative social service from taxpayers to investors who finance these programs and who receive government repayments if, and only if, the agreed-upon performance metrics are achieved. Third-party evaluators measure a program’s success, which encourages research-informed practice that can deliver measurable results.\n\nLast year, Fed Chair Janet Yellen cited research on the importance of early childhood education as a building block to opportunity that could reduce rampant inequality. She noted that, and I quote, “Research shows that children from lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.”5\n\nChair Yellen also explained that gains in early childhood education enrollment have stalled since 2010; only 41 percent of children were enrolled in state or federally supported programs in 2013. Access to these programs, most of which are specifically designated for lower-income families, is limited by the available state or local funding, and since the Great Recession, many programs have sustained budget cuts.\n\nPay for success financing is a potential strategy to preserve these important investments in social programs by leveraging private capital during times of fiscal stress. Taxpayer dollars are only deployed once cost savings through social outcomes have been realized.\n\nAlthough only eight pay for success projects have been structured nationwide to date, nearly 50 are currently in development. Throughout the Third District, stakeholders are beginning to explore applications of this investment model. For example:\n\nThere has been widespread enthusiasm about the potential of this innovative model, but at this early stage, important questions still need to be explored, including:\n\nOur Event\n\nPreventing problems such as homelessness, educational underperformance, recidivism, and poor public health is critical for the long-term economic health and prosperity of our region and our nation. Philadelphia native Benjamin Franklin, a father of American innovation, said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is hosting this meeting because it makes economic sense to explore new ways to prevent the social problems that plague our society today. And, we know that successful social investments will contribute to a stronger economic future. The presence of both local and national leaders here today is a testimony to the broad interest we share in exploring innovative ways to work together toward these goals.\n\nToday’s discussion will provide opportunities to understand and to focus on different perspectives about the purpose, appropriate uses, challenges, and risks of pay for success financing. The goal of this event is to create a community of interest around the development of social impact bonds and to identify opportunities for government officials, potential investors, and service providers to leverage pay for success financing to implement or scale social innovations.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past few weeks, I have been traveling across the District, and I have been struck by a number of things: How different our economies are from community to community and how hard our residents, community organizations, and the public sector are working to effect change. One exchange in Allentown, however, really stood out for me.\n\nWe met with a private developer who has made various investments to revitalize the downtown area. He was celebrating the successes and envisioning the future for a new and improved Allentown. In mid-conversation, he voiced his concern that the low- and moderate-income residents of Allentown were not seeing themselves in the bright economic future of the city. They were not applying for the new jobs that were available. They were not shopping in the new stores. And they were not eating in the new restaurants. He asked some folks representing the local nonprofit community what he needed to do to make sure that this changed – that the Allentown of the future was an Allentown for all residents. I mention this because it highlights a critical component for today’s meeting. There is interest from the private sector to find solutions, and this interest can be leveraged to bring about transformative change. For real change to occur, however, conversations have to begin, which brings us back to the purpose of our event today.\n\nThis meeting highlights the importance of connecting a diverse group of stakeholders and creating a dialogue that encourages a collective approach to local issues and opportunities. This challenging work requires an approach that is at once creative and forward looking. The strategies you will learn about today exemplify how social finance innovations can unite public, private, and nonprofit stakeholders by allowing risk, return, and impact to be allocated so that everyone’s needs are met while delivering social outcomes that cannot be achieved by one party alone.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) Unemployment Rate: Philadelphia County/City; http://beta.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/LAUCN421010000000003.\n\n[2]Claire Shubik-Richards, Philadelphia's Crowded, Costly Jails: The Search for Safe Solutions, The Pew Charitable Trusts Philadelphia Research Initiative, 2012.\n\n[3]Anna Fogel, Jeff Shumway, and Anant Udpa, Roadmap for Pay for Success in Philadelphia, Social Finance, 2015.\n\n[4]Keith Wardrip, Fiscal Stress in the Small Postindustrial City: Causes, Consequences, and Implications for Community Development, Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, May 2014, available at https://www.philadelphiafed.org/community-development/fiscalstress.\n\n[5]Yellen, Janet. “Perspectives on Inequality and Opportunity from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” speech given October 17, 2014, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20141017a.htm.",

            "content": "Welcome to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and to our eighth biennial research conference on consumer credit and payments, co-organized by the Bank’s Research Department and the Payment Cards Center.\n\nWe held the first event in this series in 2001. So much has changed since then.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed is the drive to understand the interaction between credit markets and the real economy.\n\nOver the years, we have also gained greater access to data about consumer credit and payments, which has helped shape the research shared at this biennial conference.\n\nThe topics of this conference come from current events. In the wake of the financial crisis that began in the subprime housing market and expanded into the Great Recession, economists at the Federal Reserve and many researchers returned to the subject of financial intermediation, an area of study that had almost faded away.\n\nThis conference has become one of the signature events on consumer credit and payments in the United States.\n\nMany papers featured in our earlier conferences have been published in the highest tiers of academic journals and have gone on to influence policy.\n\nFor example, over the years, papers have addressed:\n\nThis policy-oriented research is also reflected in the audience gathered here today. Participants include academic researchers, policymakers, and providers of financial services and data.\n\nThis year, the organizing committee received more than 140 high-quality submissions and selected seven excellent papers for presentation and discussion today. The selected papers revisit four important issues:\n\nWe are excited to hear from our presenters and discussants, but let me just acknowledge the work that this Bank does to advance the understanding of these important issues.\n\nIndeed, the Philadelphia Fed has one of the largest concentrations of expertise on household finance, consumer payments, and the retail side of bank portfolios in the Federal Reserve System or anywhere.\n\nThe economists in our Research Department, led by Mike Dotsey, are known for pathbreaking studies using new data and techniques. Seven of our 24 economists have the economics of consumer behavior and regulation as either the primary focus or as a significant part of their research. Our research economists examine these issues from perspectives ranging from sophisticated econometrics applied to terabytes of data to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models.\n\nThe Payment Cards Center (PCC) is a unique interdisciplinary research group created here about 15 years ago.\n\nBob Hunt and his 12-member team produce research that is accessible and relevant to a broad audience, including industry, consumers, policymakers, and academic researchers. Since it first began, the PCC has produced 130 studies and organized or co-organized more than 40 conferences. Moreover, the PCC has been a major participant in regulatory initiatives within the Federal Reserve System and most recently in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve the speed and security of the nation’s payments system.\n\nIn addition to the Research and the PCC departments that co-organized this event, the Bank has two important teams in the Supervision, Regulation, and Credit Department (SRC) that are recognized centers of expertise in the quantitative supervision of banks’ consumer portfolios, risk modeling, and stress testing. Paul Calem leads a team of 20, including Ph.D.s, in our Retail Risk Analysis and Financial Monitoring Group. In addition to its supervisory work, Paul’s team is helping to advance the research frontier by producing and publishing academic studies.\n\nThe SRC Department is also the home of the System’s Risk Assessment, Data Analysis, and Research (RADAR) unit, which manages a huge data warehouse of U.S. consumer credit databases and information about the asset-backed securities portfolios. Larry Cordell leads a staff of 16 and has helped make RADAR an invaluable resource for the Federal Reserve System’s supervisory and research activities around consumer credit. He and his team have also published a number of important studies in academic journals.\n\nOur Community Development Studies & Education Department, led by Theresa Singleton, is also actively engaged in data-driven research on consumer credit focusing on housing and economic inclusion for low- and moderate-income communities. In addition, Theresa and her team provide training, lesson plans, and other resources for teachers, who are educating our young people about consumer credit and payments.\n\nSo, as you can see, the Philadelphia Fed has a multidisciplined, broad-based approach to consumer credit and payments. All of these departments collaborate here in Philadelphia and with colleagues around the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAn awareness of supervisory issues informs our academic research, and the rigor of our academic research informs our supervisory work. At the same time, frequent interactions with market participants, policymakers, and consumer groups ― facilitated by the PCC ― creates opportunities for further understanding with the ultimate goal to influence future policy decisions.\n\nYou can see the results in our research in just the past 12 months. The Philadelphia Fed has published more than 25 new studies and articles on student loans, credit risk modeling, and securitization. The work has delved into the costs of foreclosures, information problems in the home appraisal process, and the macroeconomics of the housing cycle. Topics also have covered the functioning of private money, such as bitcoin, the collections process, and the role of consumer bankruptcy. Again, this just names a few.\n\nLet me conclude by telling you a little more about Philadelphia’s work on identity theft.\n\nLast year, five members of the PCC published two papers on this topic. In the first, the authors studied the various types of “alerts” that consumers place in their credit bureau files for fraud protection.\n\nThe authors found that the type of alert they choose often depends on initial conditions, including their credit scores. They also found that filers of “extended alerts,” which require the consumer to submit a police report or similar record, are clearly victims of severe examples of identity theft.\n\nIn their second paper, the authors reviewed these severe identity theft events based on the records in their credit bureau files. Let me emphasize that the data they used have been completely anonymized. The authors found there is a negative effect of identity theft on consumers’ credit reports, but for consumers with prime credit scores, these effects are transitory. There is a drop and then a recovery in credit scores within three to six months of identity theft being discovered.\n\nWhat is most intriguing is the pattern among consumers with subprime credit scores. These consumers also experienced a negative shock ― their credit scores drop ― but they subsequently experienced a rebound in their credit scores that is even larger and persistent. In other words, after experiencing a severe identity theft event, these subprime consumers have a credit score that is systematically better than we would expect from a comparable group of subprime borrowers who are not victims of identity theft.\n\nIn addition, these consumers apply for and obtain more revolving credit than their peers who did not experience identity theft.\n\nThese consumers also perform better in terms of repayment on their debts, which is why their credit scores remain elevated even after they gain access to more credit.\n\nThe authors conclude that for some consumers, identity theft is a “teachable moment,” in which consumers appreciate the significance of their credit reports on access to credit. They begin to police mistakes in their credit reports, whether they are the result of crimes or honest mistakes by one of the credit reporting agencies. They may also become more diligent in their repayment behavior, which is an extremely important component of credit scores.\n\nThat is just one example of the work our Bank is doing to advance the understanding of consumer credit and payment markets.\n\nNow, let me turn the podium over to Bob Hunt, who will introduce our first panel.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

            "content": "Good evening, everyone, and thank you for being here. It is truly an honor to have been invited to Carnegie Mellon to provide this University Lecture.\n\nTo Provost Garrett, thank you for the tremendous welcome.\n\nI must begin by acknowledging the late CMU President Jerry Cohon, who left a truly exemplary legacy here at Carnegie Mellon.\n\nJerry and I both had the honor of serving as university presidents at the same time — the latter half of his tenure here overlapping with six of my eight years as president of the University of Delaware. Shortly before his passing this past March, he was instrumental in bringing me and Dean Krishnan together in the informal discussion that has led to us being here.\n\nAdditionally, President Cohon actually played a role, vital if indirect, in my own academic career. I did my undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral studies at the University of Pennsylvania — a school that some of you may be tempted to refer to as the Carnegie Mellon of Philadelphia. Regardless, President Cohon was the doctoral advisor to my doctoral advisor. So, I consider him my academic grandfather.\n\nGiven all he has meant to this university, it is entirely fitting that we find ourselves in the Cohon University Center as his spirit is very much present in our convening this evening.\n\nAnd even though I’m currently outside the Third Federal Reserve District, I must admit to an affinity for the City of Pittsburgh, as well, and not just because of its historic standing as a place of both industry and academics. My wife has family here. So, I had two good reasons to make it through the Allegheny tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.\n\nBut to be sure, my fondness for yinz aside, I’m always going to be a Philly sports fan.\n\nAs a career academic, another reason I’m so pleased to be here is simply because I enjoy meeting with students and talking about what you have in store for yourselves — perhaps that’s just the old professor in me. But, as a Federal Reserve Bank President, I also look at every college visit as a recruiting opportunity! For those among us who are economics or finance majors, the Fed may have a place for you. After all, the Federal Reserve is arguably the nation’s largest employer of economists.\n\nBut for those of you who are engineering and computer science majors lured in by the title of this lecture, I hope you will hear something that will likewise make you want to look at the Fed as a potential career.\n\nAs pleased as I am to be here speaking to you — this is a “lecture,” after all — I am going to leave a few moments to sit down with Dr. Zetlin-Jones and take some questions. But in order to get to that, I first must get through my prepared remarks! So, let’s get to it.\n\nNow, before I go any further, I am required to take a quick pause for a very important announcement — the Federal Reserve disclaimer! So, the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nI can imagine that the first question on many minds is something along the lines of, “Why does the president of a Federal Reserve Bank care about artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and these other emerging technologies? Doesn’t the Fed only care about interest rates?”\n\nThat’s a fair question. After all, there is nothing about technology noted in the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate — the focus for our work which Congress handed down to us in the 1970s to clarify our goal as a central bank. The dual mandate says that the Fed must be concerned, first and foremost, with securing stable prices and maximum employment for the American people.\n\nBut if you look deeper, you will see an entire range of issues which emanate, whether directly or indirectly, from the dual mandate.\n\nTwo months ago, I had the privilege of speaking to students at Tulane University. The title of that lecture was, somewhat also fitting for tonight, “The Federal Reserve: It's More Than Just Interest Rates.”\n\nAnd that also, I think, works in describing my own life’s journey which led to my current position. I am not an economist in the pure sense. I did not set out in my own education to become an economist. By education and training, I am an engineer, specifically a civil engineer — infrastructure, transportation, and the like. It was actually my engineering work which led me to economics. Years ago, I was working on an engineering problem related to railroads. I realized that finding the solution required me to understand the underlying economics. So, back to school I went.\n\nOne of the things that has struck me over time is how much economists and engineers have in common. Beyond the fact that we aren’t considered by some as the most exciting party guests. Not that the study of either discipline leaves much time for parties.\n\nI know I am far from the first person to have been struck by this interdisciplinary relationship. In fact, you can trace this all the way back to when the eminent engineer John Hayford, then director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University, wrote an essay in the Journal of Political Economy titled, “The Relation of Engineering to Economics,” from which I will read the following:\n\n“Economics and engineering are closely related. Economics has been defined as the social science of earning a living. With the same appropriateness, engineering may be defined to be physical science applied to helping groups [. . .] to make a better living.”1\n\nSo, there you have the answer to that question — it is more than interest rates.\n\nAs an economist, and especially as president and CEO of the Philadelphia Fed, my goal is to ensure a stable economy that provides opportunities for everyone to grow and succeed — much as my goal as a civil engineer is to ensure a safe, reliable, and stable infrastructure which provides opportunities for all communities to grow and succeed.\n\nBut there’s also another part of my engineering background which relates directly to my work as an economist. As an economist, I look at lots and lots of data to find efficiencies and calculate risks. But as an engineer, I am also trained to look at systems and think, “There has to be a way to make that more efficient, safer, and better.”\n\nSo, getting that square peg of economics into that round hole of engineering has been a bit of a passion of mine. During my tenure at the Philadelphia Fed, I have strived to make us a thought leader within the Federal Reserve System when it comes to issues related to understanding emerging technologies and their possible impacts on our economy.\n\nFrom both the financial-services provider and consumer ends, AI and ML are both key underpinnings of the fintech revolution. So, from the standpoint of the Federal Reserve as the nation’s central bank and securer of a strong and responsive financial system, fintech is something we must watch very closely.\n\nIn fact, the Philadelphia Fed hosts an annual fintech conference, bringing together all sides of the fintech space — entrepreneurs, financial institutions, regulators, and everyone in-between — for two days of discussions and presentations of current research. Three weeks ago, we hosted the eighth annual edition of this conference, drawing nearly 1,700 total participants. In its eight years, the conference has grown to become one with a truly global reach. The thought leadership brought together under one banner is simply remarkable.\n\nYet, one of the evergreen questions hovering over every iteration of the Fintech Conference, and one that I ask myself, is this: “To what end?” What is the end goal of the fintech revolution?\n\nThe answer lies in how we bring these new technologies into the broader economy. Surely, AI and ML have transformative potential for our financial system. We are already seeing some of this play out in such areas such as instant payments technology, which has experienced a wide acceptance by both banking institutions and consumers across many platforms.\n\nBut, in the long run, how transformative is this payments technology? From an economic standpoint, it’s one thing to create a technology that makes it easier for an individual to tend to their personal financial accounts via their phone, but it’s another thing to create one that truly generates broad, net-positive economic change.\n\nSo, these broader issues related to growth and employment — remember that second part of our dual mandate, “maximum employment” — make AI an issue of not just technological but also economic importance. And as new technologies come online, we need to understand their potential impacts so we can make the appropriate adjustments to public policy.\n\nSo, when we see these potentially game-changing technologies emerge, we must think of the regulatory environments in which they function. In other words, there is no freedom without responsibility. And, further, I would argue that partnership between technologists and regulators is ultimately good — it is good for industry and competition, it is good for users, and it is good for economic systems. In fact, I may go further than “good” to say “necessary.”\n\nLet’s look at AI, specifically, for the moment. Let’s start with a recognition that artificial intelligence is nothing new. The term itself was coined all the way back in 1955, a decade after Alan Turing employed the underlying concepts of computer science in creating his machine that cracked the German war codes and helped the Allies win World War II.\n\nOver the past nearly 70 years, popular culture has, time and again, showcased the potential net positives of AI. But let's not overlook the potential downside that was highlighted as early as the classic 1968 movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nLast winter, my Philadelphia Fed colleague, Economist and Advisor Lukasz Drozd, co-authored an article for our quarterly economic journal looking at this riddle. And the article came to the following conclusion: “The concerning aspect of AI, as we see it, is that it is a major general purpose technology with the potential to broadly and persistently tilt the incoming flow of new capital-productivity-augmenting innovations toward those that automate tasks, rather than augment the productivity of capital in previously automated tasks.”2\n\nSo, if you’ll allow me to be a little glib — creating a code-cracking machine to win a war that saves the world from despotism is one thing; creating a new app that eliminates the job of a financial services professional so you can pay back your friend for last night’s pizza over your smartphone is another.\n\nAnother way to look at this is through the lens of Robert Gordon, the eminent economist from Northwestern University, who authored the book, The Rise and Fall of American Growth. In it, he argues that the last period of huge, economically transformational technological leaps ended with the close of World War II.3 Not that the economy hasn’t continued to grow, but that the technological leaps which allowed for massive changes in living standards, incomes, future potential, ended — and I am taking some liberties here — roughly with the advents of electric power distribution and the internal combustion engine. Gordon posits that everything has been accomplished more on the margins of the growth enabled by those technologies rather than by leaping over them.\n\nAnd even beyond that, we have to look at the questions of whether these apps, even in their created efficiencies, are actually providing consumers with end-user benefits. And that question is not yet settled.\n\nAs proof that this question remains open, I look to the work of New York University economist and professor Thomas Philippon and, specifically, his 2019 book, The Great Reversal. This is a work which I also brought to the attention of the participants at the Fintech Conference three weeks ago.\n\nLike Gordon, Philippon takes a critical eye to the workings of the American economy over time, including the financial sector. And in doing so, he uncovered something somewhat paradoxical. Philippon looked at the cost of financial intermediation as a proportion of U.S. Gross Domestic Product over a 130-year span, from 1880 to 2010. What he saw was an upward trend line. In 1880, this share was 2 percent. For nearly a century, while there was both growth and some outlier boom years, this share of GDP never consistently topped 6 percent until the 1980s. By the time his dataset reached its end point, again in 2010, this figure was 8 percent.4\n\nNow, as we take a step back, this upward trend makes perfect sense, especially the 2-percent uptick in that last 30-year span. The volume of products and services offered by financial institutions and nonbank intermediaries have grown greatly since 1880 and took off with the advent of the Internet and the smartphone. So, therefore, it follows that there would be a growing impact on total GDP. No argument here.\n\nBut Philippon found something else when he looked at the unit cost of financial intermediation — or the cost of providing a service to a consumer. What his data showed was that, between 1880 and 2010, the cost of these services to the consumer remained roughly constant at around 2 percent. An update to his initial research, in which he added five years of data up to 2015, revealed a slight drop below that 2 percent trend line. So, if that becomes a trend, that’s a positive one. But the underlying sentiment is that overall costs have yet to fall significantly since 1880.\n\nThis, as he states, creates a puzzle — if we have so much more invested in the intermediary systems in the name of enhancing the efficiency and speed of our financial system, why has the cost at the consumer’s end remained steady? The financial system of 2024 is significantly more efficient than the financial system of 1924, let alone 1880. Moreover, the number of choices before consumers has grown — again, look at all the different apps through which you can repay your friend for that pizza. Fintech has removed so many barriers to movement. So, why hasn’t this cost decreased by more?\n\nThese are both fair questions, and ones for which I don’t yet have an answer.\n\nBut there’s another issue gnawing at me, as well, as we go deeper down the proverbial fintech rabbit hole. We must also take into consideration how data is being put into AI modeling to ensure fairness for consumers — all consumers. This is an aspect with which we at the Fed, as regulator of financial institutions and practices, are also especially concerned.\n\nWhile certainly I do not wish to presuppose anything about any financial player, history shows that discriminatory and even predatory practices have occurred. In the past this has, unfortunately, many times been because of direct human intervention. Think of restrictive housing covenants, for example. Thankfully, decades of new laws and policies have eliminated much of this past discrimination. Much, but not all.\n\nThe hope is that AI programs may help finalize a level playing field for all consumers by considering only the data which an applicant for a financial service brings into the decision-making process, and not the personal attributes of that applicant.\n\nBut, even here, we find a challenge. Algorithms are not perfect. Errors in inputs can exacerbate bias in outcomes that can fan out across multiple applicants. And if institutions are sharing data or using the same programs to evaluate risks, these errors can have widespread impacts. Indeed, a report issued by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service this past April noted that, “models created using the same data sets may reach the same or similar insights. [. . .] Errors, risks, and unrepresentative conditions in the data would be propagated across the system, potentially fostering systemic risks.”5\n\nIt’s very much like the old computer programmers' fear, “garbage in, garbage out.” But when it comes to the nation’s financial system, and ensuring both fairness and resilience against risk, keeping the garbage out takes on a new dimension of immediacy.\n\nBut, before you sit here and think, “Wow, Pat is really down on AI — who invited him?” allow me to bring forward some optimism. Because I am optimistic about this. We at the Philly Fed are engaged, along with other partners, in an exciting new effort to bring the power of AI and machine learning to expand the data available to researchers so we can better understand not just the economic challenges and opportunities we face, but also the histories which brought us to these moments.\n\nThis effort is centered in an endeavor we call CREED, the great acronym of the Center for the REstoration of Economic Data at the Philadelphia Fed. CREED’s aim is to use AI tools to take unstructured, analog data and convert it to high-quality, digital data that researchers, journalists, Carnegie Mellon students, and others can use to expand their own economic models or even just their own economic understanding.\n\nAnd this is one area where I truly see AI and ML impacting the field of economics, by opening up access to untold amounts of historic data. Certainly, we have lots of data already at our disposal to help us build models or educate sophisticated algorithms. Many of those datasets go back decades. But imagine what could be possible if, instead of decades worth of data, we have access to a century or more of data. That’s what CREED is seeking to do — providing historical context that current data sets cannot.\n\nHistory and experience both tell us that small decisions can have big impacts. Moreover, these impacts can persist for a long time, even if time deems initial choices irrelevant.\n\nA research area in which the potential for these new data in enriching our knowledge is in housing. The cost of housing — regardless of whether we are discussing rents or purchase prices — is a hot topic right now, and for good reason. As economists, we want to try to understand how the housing market may move going forward based on past data. We can easily look back across the past 20 years to see the cyclical rise and fall of prices. But imagine if we could look even deeper in time, fine-tuning our models and understanding of how markets react.\n\nOne of my Philadelphia Fed colleagues, Economic Advisor and Economist Allison Shertzer, joined other researchers in taking that deeper look by analyzing pricing data from digitized newspaper real estate sections, covering some 30 major housing markets, in some cases going all the way back to 1890.6 This research is filling in what were previously blank spots in economic history.\n\nOne of the heads of CREED, my colleague Larry Santucci, led a team of researchers that took the digitized data from thousands of Philadelphia housing deeds to create a map tracing the growth and spread of racial covenants in the city. Now, certainly, racial covenants have been unenforceable since 1948 and ultimately outlawed under federal law in 1968.\n\nBut remember what I just said about long-term impacts, even if that which allowed the initial practice has gone away. Philadelphia today remains the poorest large city in America as well as among the nation’s most racially segregated. The conscious decisions made about where and whether certain individuals could live in certain parts of this city still ripple across the map of Philadelphia. The racial covenants map clearly traces those ripples in a way that policymakers and others today can see as they craft potential solutions.\n\nAnd another research project underway at the Philadelphia Fed is using historical data to measure how even proposed highway segments can have a permanent negative impact on central city neighborhoods, even if the project is never constructed. As both an economist and engineer, I am especially curious to see the findings of this research.\n\nMy reason in bringing this up is because we must take an expansive understanding of AI when it comes to the economics field. And CREED is one way I see AI moving to that ideal which Lukasz Drozd proposed — as a means of augmenting productivity, even in economic research. But in an age when data is being created at an unprecedented scale, we have to sometimes take a step back and realize that historical data does not lose its value and may, in fact, become even more invaluable.\n\nAnd, finally, I must also note how all of the above may be changed by even greater magnitudes by the oncoming revolution of quantum computing (QC). This is an area in which we at the Philadelphia Fed are also engaged in research. And this, again, is an area in which I am both optimistic and cautious.\n\nThe imagined potential for QC to dramatically change how economic models are built and run is seemingly endless.7 From analysis of financial market data in detail we have not yet seen to conducting complex risk assessments with an accuracy we have yet to achieve with classical computing, and doing so with both real-time and historical data, QC will likely change the entire game.\n\nBut I also see the potential for QC to pose a cybersecurity threat if its power is harnessed for hacking encryption algorithms, putting at risk the security of global monetary policy and financial markets. So, as Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben reminds us, “With great power comes great responsibility.”\n\nAll of this brings me back to the fundamental question about AI and fintech that I opened with, “To what end?”\n\nWe need guardrails. We need clarity in purpose. And we need an understanding of what may be next.\n\nThe choice of whether AI has a huge positive or not-so-positive effect is not a matter of technology — it is a matter of how we, as humans, choose to use technology.\n\nThis is where I turn to all of you. You are entering this field at an auspicious time, as these technologies are being shaped and commercialized. And so, you are the ones who are going to be most deeply engaged in finding that end.\n\nAnd perhaps, too, that end will also include a technology that proves both Robert Gordon and Thomas Philippon wrong — an advancement that stands alongside electricity and the internal combustion engine in boosting productivity and harnessing broad, long-term, and positive societal change while bringing true value to those who use it.\n\nWhat a brave new world that would be — but that’s a different lecture!\n\nThank you for listening along. But now I want to hear your thoughts and your voices. So, again, thank you for the invitation to be here.\n\nI’ll be happy to take some questions.",
