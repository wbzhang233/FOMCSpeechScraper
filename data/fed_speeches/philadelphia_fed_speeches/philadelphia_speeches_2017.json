        "content": "Good morning and welcome. I am pleased to be here at the 12th Philadelphia Fed Policy Forum, my second since joining the Bank as president and CEO in 2015. I am excited to continue the biennial tradition that brings together some of the world’s most renowned economic thought leaders to discuss emerging research and its implications for economic policy.\n\nThis year, we’ve shifted locations. While normally this event is held at the Philadelphia Fed, we have brought it here to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia to accommodate an expanded audience for this year’s forum.\n\nWhile you are here, I encourage you to visit the Mütter Museum. The College of Physicians has graciously offered free entrance today to its museum of medical history to all our attendees. If you have not been, it’s really a can’t-miss, quintessential Philadelphia experience. I must say, the Philadelphia Fed’s headquarters has many charms, but we really can’t compete with the Soap Lady or Albert Einstein’s brain.\n\nBefore I begin, let me give the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nPromoting Inclusive Economic Growth\n\nThe shift for the Policy Forum is more than just geographic. This year, our theme is People, Place, Prosperity: Revitalizing Our Cities. This may seem off-topic for the Fed, from a focus on monetary policy and interest rates, to a focus on how the economy can develop in a way that reduces poverty and inequality. But it really isn’t. It’s merely a different way of looking at the same issues. And the high turnout for this event really speaks to the level of interest among you, one of our key audiences, to find ways to better understand and address these issues.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. When you think about what that means, our mission is really about creating an environment that promotes economic growth that is sustainable in the long term and that provides economic opportunity for everyone. That second goal — economic opportunity — means we want growth that is inclusive and accessible across all income groups and communities.\n\nThat’s because when we talk about the economy, we are really talking about people. People acquiring the right skills to find stable, family-sustaining jobs. People getting the best education for their children so that they can succeed. And it’s about the neighborhoods where people live and about the best way to ensure that their communities thrive.\n\nThat’s where the Fed’s community development function comes in, something that is near and dear to my heart.\n\nFor the past year, we at the Philadelphia Fed have been working on our Economic Growth & Mobility Project, or EGMP. This new initiative looks for practical applications for research in the area of inclusive economic growth. For instance, the Philadelphia Fed is involved in efforts in northeastern Pennsylvania to create an equitable transit system. We have provided regional-focused research and convened stakeholders to start the process of devising a transit system in the Scranton area that gets people to jobs and the other places they need to go.\n\nEGMP is about looking at the economy as a whole, looking beyond the data. Which isn’t to say numbers and data aren’t important. I am an engineer by training, so believe me when I say I love numbers. But numbers don’t tell the whole story. Overall, the U.S. economy is doing pretty well. Real GDP grew at a strong annual rate of 3 percent or better in the second and third quarters of this year. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent in October, is at the lowest since the year 2000. But when we look across the country, there are people and places that don’t share in that good fortune.\n\nRevitalizing Our Cities\n\nIt is fitting that we host you here in the City of Philadelphia. According to a recent study by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city has the highest percentage of residents living in deep poverty.1 The region’s poor are concentrated mainly in the city rather than in the counties that surround it. Philadelphia has only 26 percent of the region’s residents, but it is home to 51 percent of the poor.2 So, this is a good place to be having a discussion about revitalizing cities. Philadelphia may have the dubious distinction as the “poorest,” but it is by no means alone in the problems it faces or in its aspirations for the future.\n\nI travel frequently around the Third Federal Reserve District — which comprises eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware — and my monetary policy work takes me all over the world. These firsthand experiences really frame how I look at today’s agenda. Because everywhere I go, I meet people who are grappling with the same questions at the intersection of people, place, and prosperity. How do we build wealth in our communities without displacing residents? How do we plan for the coming technological innovations and make sure workers have the requisite skills to succeed? How do we promote not just economic growth but equitable growth for all? These are the questions we’ll be exploring here today.\n\nAs always with the Policy Forum, we are fortunate to have a truly all-star lineup to lead our discussion.\n\nResearch Focusing on People, Place, and Prosperity\n\nFor those of you who have been with us before, the structure of this year’s event will be a bit different. We’ll be opening with two academic panels. First, Gilles Duranton of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Edward Glaeser of Harvard University, and Henry Overman of the London School of Economics will kick us off with a presentation of research focusing on place — specifically, on urban growth and revitalization. Gerald Carlino, Philadelphia Fed emeritus economist, will moderate.\n\nSecond, we will focus on people by exploring the link between education and economic mobility. This panel will feature Will Dobbie of Princeton University and a visiting scholar at the Philadelphia Fed and Ingrid Gould Ellen of New York University. Phoebe Haddon, chancellor of Rutgers University–Camden and a member of the Philadelphia Fed’s board of directors, will moderate.\n\nLast, but not least, John Fry, president of Drexel University and a member of the Philadelphia Fed’s Economic and Community Advisory Council, will introduce our last session that will focus on the connection between people and place and how we promote prosperity. Michael Nutter, former mayor of Philadelphia and a member of our Economic and Community Advisory Council, will join Dennis Lower of Cortex Innovation Community in St. Louis in a discussion. Amy Liu, director of the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program, will moderate.\n\nThe speakers are not only some of the most prominent scholars in their fields, but you may have noticed that some of them are among the Philadelphia Fed’s most valued partners. Their participation should tell you how seriously we take these issues.\n\nI also want to note that the shift in the Policy Forum is the result of the leadership of Mike Dotsey, the Philadelphia Fed’s director of research. Mike wanted to use the event as a platform for applying the same high-level, rigorous discussion of research that has always been the hallmark of the Policy Forum to advance the goals of the EGMP. I’d like to applaud Mike and his team for their hard work in organizing this event. And I’d also like to give a special shout out to Theresa Singleton and her staff, who lead the Philadelphia Fed’s community development efforts and the work of the EGMP.\n\nA special thank you as well to the members of our board, advisory councils, and our visiting scholars who are with us today. Will, Phoebe, John, and Mike, thank you for joining us. We are so grateful for your participation as leaders who care deeply about the subjects we’ll examine during this forum.\n\nDuring the day, there will be many opportunities for you, our guests, to ask questions and engage with our speakers and with each other. As you can see, audience participation is written into the agenda. I look forward to the discussions you’ll have here, and I thank you for being a part of this year’s event. If you happen to use Twitter, please join the conversation using the hashtag #PhilFedForum.\n\nA 230-year-old medical college may not seem an apt location for this policy forum. But the mission statement of this august establishment reads “to advance the science of medicine and to thereby lessen human misery.” It is that same sense of purpose and concern for humankind that bring us together today to address some of our society’s biggest challenges.\n\nThank you. And, remember, if you have time, Einstein’s brain.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]The Pew Charitable Trusts, Philadelphia’s Poor: Who they are, where they live, and how that has changed,  The Pew Charitable Trusts (2017).\n\n[2]The Pew Charitable Trusts.",

        "content": "Good morning and thank you. That video is a powerful reminder that the issue of financial predation doesn’t just have a financial cost; it affects health, family bonds, and overall well-being. I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge Philip Marshall for attending this conference, but more importantly, for his courage, his example, and his continued advocacy. The fact that this case was so high profile helped turn attention to the growing problem of financial exploitation of older Americans, and your sustained work has helped to keep it focused. I hope today that we will add to the conversation.\n\nBefore that conversation begins, however, I should issue the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWhile the question of protecting our older citizens is always important, it is increasingly taking on wide-ranging implications, owing to the simple math of demographics. With the boomers, we will see the largest generation in history ushered into retirement and older age. Not to mention that they are living longer than any generation before them. As a boomer myself, I think this is great news. But from both a regulatory and an economic perspective, it’s something that deserves full attention.\n\nThis conference will cover some of the key problems and conundrums of the often murky subject of financial safety for our aging population. I don’t expect that we will manage to solve each of them in the space of two days — though hope springs eternal — but I do think that this is a platform to discuss them frankly and address them head-on.\n\nThe first is to outline the scope of the issue or, in some cases, the lack of scope. While there has been some excellent research, we don’t yet have firm data on exactly how large the issue is. Estimates of the annual cost of exploitation alone range from just under $3 billion to over $36 billion.1 And that’s not necessarily taking into account the wider range of fraud.\n\nThere is also the matter of how and when victimization may be exacerbated. While the extended golden years are in and of themselves a good thing, they are often accompanied by flagging physical and cognitive health, each of which can affect both access and attention to finances, leaving people more vulnerable.\n\nAdd whatever unknown unknowns are out there to the known unknowns, and we’re in brand new territory. Without a greater understanding of its size and scope, we’re limited both in combatting the problem and knowing how effective our efforts are.\n\nLike virtually every issue of import, this is not a problem that stands in isolation. It is woven into other segments of the economy — health care, for instance, or student debt. As an example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has reported that in the decade before 2015, the number of adults over 60 taking on student loans fully quadrupled, with roughly three-quarters assumed on behalf of children and grandchildren.2 Not only does that have the potential to spill over to the real economy, it’s poised to become a multigenerational problem.\n\nI should also note the obvious, that more people living longer means more people entering retirement with plans that may have estimated a shorter life expectancy — on fixed incomes that could be further compromised by the health issues that become more common as we age. That could add to debt, and, in turn, to the possibility of default. Research from the New York Fed shows that debt held by people between 50 and 80 increased some 60 percent from 2003 to 2015.3\n\nWhile each of these factors — student debt, retirement costs, eldercare — might not be crisis inducing in and of itself, the interconnectivity could make the sum more systemically dangerous than its individual parts. It may be that the problem of elder financial exploitation is not fully contained but could spill over into the larger economy. The sheer size and complexity pose a challenge for industry and regulators alike.\n\nI don’t mean to sound alarmist, but this is a set of circumstances ripe to balloon.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it has yet, and the best guard against a future crisis is building a bulwark in the present.\n\nThat brings me to the second issue: financial institutions’ concerns about the conundrums posed by current laws and regulations. While institutions want to help protect their customers, especially vulnerable seniors, they’re worried about the legal consequences of putting holds on suspicious electronic transfers and deposits because they’re legally bound to expedite the process. They’re also reluctant to share information about potentially suspicious account activity with other institutions for fear of violating federal and state privacy laws.\n\nThat’s particularly unfortunate because we have evidence that sharing information could be a huge help. Larry Santucci just published a paper that looks at how data sharing among financial institutions could improve the financial health of older Americans, specifically those with cognitive difficulties. He’ll be discussing it tomorrow, so I urge you to stick around for day two.\n\nThere will be some relief from these regulatory concerns when the FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) rule changes go into effect next February. Brokerages will be allowed to place temporary holds on disbursements of funds or securities when they have reasonable belief that certain customers may be victims of financial exploitation. Additionally, new rules will require those institutions to make an effort to obtain names and information for trusted contacts on such customers’ accounts. But I understand that there is still more that needs to be done.\n\nThat leads me to the third issue that should be addressed today, which is banks’ engagement and responsibility on both an individual and an industry level.\n\nLike much of the other information, we are in Wild West territory regarding exactly who is pursuing solutions. And while I know that “data” isn’t the plural of “anecdote,” I am concerned that some of my research staff estimates a relatively low number of institutions actively looking for and implementing safeguards.\n\nAgain, there has been some regulatory constraint, and I understand the predicament. But I know it can be done because there is already some very good work being done by individual banks, some of which we will hear from during the course of this conference. The more we discuss the issue in venues like this, the more we can learn about best practices. It makes sense to address the problem early on, so industry can inform regulation as it develops. The interest of regulator and institution is the same here: protecting the customer.\n\nFrom our perspective, it’s the sine qua non of regulation. From the industry’s, it’s an essential business component because it’s fundamental to trust. The entire financial system, and each of its constituent parts, is dependent on consumer trust to function correctly. Getting out in front of an issue, particularly one this potentially significant, is good for everyone.\n\nAs a Fed president, I draft neither regulation nor legislation; so you’re probably thinking it’s easy to make the call when you’re not on the field. And I’m not telling anyone how to run their own organization. But I would urge everyone to study the issue and embed solutions. Share your ideas so we can learn from one another. Make working on those ideas a business priority. And finally, work together. Whether it’s a task force or a set of industry standards, finding a way to guide the solution in real time, instead of waiting for reactive regulation, is in the financial services industry’s best interest, as well as the consumer’s. In the words of an old proverb, if we don’t change our direction, we’re likely to end up where we’re headed.\n\nWith that, I’ve done enough pontificating, and I’ll relinquish the floor. Before I go, I want to say that I truly do value the industry insight and the work done by our regulatory colleagues. So thank you all for coming today and for your input. Thank you also to the team here, along with Dr. Jason Karlawish and his team at Penn Medicine, for bringing together such a great group of panelists and to everyone taking the time to present. This discussion is too important to let go quiet.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, “Recommendations and Report for Financial Institutions on Preventing and Responding to Elder Financial Exploitation,” March 2016, http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201603_cfpb_recommendations-and-report-for-financial-institutions-on-preventing-and-responding-to-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf.\n\n[2]https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-warns-student-loan-servicing-problems-can-jeopardize-long-term-financial-security-older-borrowers/\n\n[3]http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/02/the-graying-of-american-debt.html\n\n",

        "content": "Good morning. It truly is a pleasure to be here, and I’d like to thank our hosts for their exceptional hospitality and such exquisite surroundings. In cases like this, you feel compelled to reciprocate, by way of cultural exchange, with some emblem of your country. But I realize that some of what we hold to be quintessentially American — from blue jeans to baseball — have been so embraced, and dare I say even so improved in some cases, that they’re also quintessentially Japanese. I find, therefore, that the remaining, unique tradition I can share is this: the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, I’ll begin by noting the subject of today’s panel: How to cope with unconventional policy. I suppose this stands out to me because, while unconventional policy certainly needs to be managed and requires an adjustment by both policymakers and markets, it is, overall, a coping mechanism in and of itself. Each of us turned to these tools to address our own situations during and after the financial crisis. Unconventional policy was the salve to the crisis’s wounds.\n\nThe Road to Normal\n\nEach of us on this panel, and indeed in this room, brings a different perspective on how those policies played out. But we’re all more or less on the same path; we’re just at different points on a journey that ultimately leads to normalization. In the U.S., we’re a bit farther along than our counterparts and, as such, can be looked at as something of a test case, though the cynic might compare us instead to the canary in the proverbial coal mine. In either case, our steps so far can prove illuminating, and some of our research and discoveries may prove informative as well.\n\nThe caveat, of course, is that there are a few differences in the case of the U.S. Unlike many in this room, the U.S. did not enter into a regime of negative rates. Instead, we lowered the fed funds rate to essentially zero, then engaged in three rounds of quantitative easing when rates failed to adequately spur recovery. We aren’t alone in that experience, although we are farther ahead in terms of normalization. And the last qualification: In the grand tradition of Americans retaining the imperial measurement and Fahrenheit systems, monetary policy implementation in the U.S. is just different enough than others’ to make exact translation difficult.\n\nThat said, I believe our experience can still be informative.\n\nUnconventional Policy and the Fed’s Balance Sheet\n\nAs a quick reminder, I’ll offer a brief history of U.S. monetary policy during and after the crash. When lowering rates to near-zero failed to jump-start the economy, we turned, as most of us here did, to unconventional policies, which were primarily driven by large-scale asset purchases, or LSAPs — a phrase policy wonks concede we have lost the battle on, so I’ll simply refer to the program by its better known moniker of quantitative easing, or QE.\n\nQE involved buying more and different assets than our usual practice of holding mostly short-term Treasuries. We purchased longer-term Treasuries and bought mortgage-backed securities. The balance sheet swelled to approximately $4.5 trillion, a significant increase from the roughly $900 billion balance before the onset of the crisis.\n\nSince late 2014, when we ended the purchases, we’ve been reinvesting the proceedings as they’ve reached maturity, keeping the balance sheet constant, until last month.\n\nA modest rate hike in December of 2015 signaled the first baby steps toward normalization. We’ve since raised them three more times, by 25 basis points each time, and I still have another 25 basis point rate increase penciled in for this year, although perhaps I should say, “lightly penciled in.”\n\nUnwinding\n\nThat, of course, is not the only mechanism by which normalization must occur. In our September FOMC meeting, we voted to start the process of unwinding the balance sheet, commencing last month. The size of the balance sheet is larger than we’ve ever seen, and the MBS in particular renders its makeup different than before the crisis. Current assets are made up primarily of those Treasuries and MBS, while the liability side overwhelmingly consists of paper currency and bank reserves and balances and, to a much lesser extent, the overnight reverse repurchase — or reverse repo — facility.\n\nIt’s true that we haven’t faced exactly this type of normalization before — no one has — but it’s also true that it’s unlikely to be remotely interesting as a policy event, except as a chapter in some future generation’s economics textbook. It will be slow, deliberate, boring, and essentially on autopilot.\n\nTo look at what we’ve done — and are planning to do — and to consider what lessons that could hold for other central banks, we should go back to first principles.\n\n“Why,” for instance, is a legitimate question. It is possible to maintain an exorbitantly large balance sheet and let the growth of the economy eventually render it proportional.\n\nFrom my perspective, removing accommodation is the right next step for a few reasons. Monetary policy in the United States has been very accommodative for close to a decade. The economy now is more or less at full strength: There’s very little slack left in the labor market and growth has kept pace with our projections. Inflation is still below the Fed’s target rate and is the one area that not only continues to elicit caution, it even constitutes a conundrum … I won’t get into too much detail, but some work by my staff suggests that the Phillips curve has not been a good predictor of inflation over the past several decades.1 I do think we have to be cautious, therefore, about how we’re measuring inflation. At the same time, I don’t advocate throwing out all conventional economic positions with the bathwater. With a labor market this tight, inflation is likely to reassert itself at some point. All of which is to say that as we near the point of full health, it makes sense to return policy to a more normal stance.\n\nThis is also about keeping our powder dry. In the event of another shock to the system, I want our tools to be at their most effective and, in my view, that means reducing our balance sheet. Additionally, as productivity has dropped, it’s taken the neutral funds rate with it, making the zero lower bound closer and resulting in less room for maneuver with the funds rate, which will continue to be our primary monetary policy tool.\n\nIn the case of rates returning to zero, then, if something were to happen — if another crisis were to occur — further asset purchases may prove less effective, or perhaps simply more difficult and costly to execute, with a large balance sheet still in place.\n\nThe famous line is that the Fed takes away the punch bowl just as the party is getting good. I don’t think we’re taking away the bowl; I think we’re making sure there’s enough punch for the future.\n\nSlow, Predictable, and Utterly Unexciting\n\nIn making the decision to start bringing the balance sheet back into alignment, three aspects were crucial. How to do it was obviously top of mind but also how to ensure a slow, steady pace that could essentially be left to churn on its own. We also knew, from past experience, that communicating our intentions was going to be a key factor in the efforts.\n\nThe means of unwinding the balance sheet were straightforward: We could either stop reinvesting the securities as they come to maturity or sell them on the open market. We opted for the former, with gradually increasing caps on the amounts that are not reinvested. This ensures the crucial aspects of gradual, predictable, and boring that we’re aiming for.\n\nThis is not to say that we will ignore the process as it unfolds. We’ll keep a watchful eye and revisit it in meetings. If economic or other events necessitate intervention, we’ll make that call. But we fundamentally want this to slowly and mechanically happen in the background.\n\nI’ve said before that this will be the policy equivalent of watching paint dry. But I should specify that the paint is oil based; the process is going to take some time. We have not yet established what the new normal will look like.\n\nThe balance sheet will definitely be bigger than it was before the crisis because the economy is bigger. But its eventual size will depend on how overnight and other short-term rates behave as the unwinding progresses.\n\nAlso vital to our plans is the sense of predictability. I’m not sure there’s a single Fed employee, from president to examiner, who didn’t take the lessons of the 2013 taper tantrum to heart. Regarding unwinding then, we made every effort to communicate early and often, and as clearly as possible — a feat for an organization renowned for its policy speak — to ensure the message was clear. The market response to the announcement was somewhere between a yawn and a shrug, so I really do have to commend the entire Fed System for the clarity and consistency of the message. It’s one of the key successes I’d point to in managing normalization after such an extraordinary time.\n\nKey Lessons\n\nThere are other lessons to be gleaned, not just from the progress on the balance sheet, but from the moment of liftoff.\n\nOne of the most important is that, in the normalization process, it’s possible to manage the balance sheet and rates separately, albeit with limits.\n\nWhen we ended QE in late 2014, serious questions were posed about the feasibility of raising rates, given the size of the balance sheet. Traditionally, the New York Fed’s markets units that implement the policy — which we refer to simply as “the Desk” — implemented rate increases by making reserves scarce in the fed funds market. But more than $2 trillion of reserves rendered them anything but scarce. The only way the Desk could remove $2 trillion of reserves overnight would be by effectively holding the largest fire sale in economic history.\n\nThe current situation necessitated a great deal of effort to gain a deep understanding of uncharted waters. Ultimately, a combination of expertise and analysis engineered a successful liftoff in December 2015. Rates have been under control since and remain well connected to other money markets. As the FOMC decides to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, it increases both the interest banks earn on reserves and the rate an extended list of counterparties can earn via the reverse repo facility.\n\nHere I’ll return to the note I made earlier that the United States differs in a few areas. In the classic model of a corridor system, the interest on reserves provides a floor, for the obvious reason that no bank wants to lend at a lower rate than it would earn by simply keeping its balances. In the U.S., however, not all institutions qualify to earn interest on reserves. With reserve markets satiated, it is therefore the reverse repos — available to a wider range of additional institutions — that provide a firm floor on market rates and the interest on reserves provides a cap.\n\nThese two rates — interest on reserves and reverse repos — currently form the boundaries of the fed funds target. Research by my staff correctly predicted that most fed funds trades would occur at rates safely in the middle of the target range, even if actual use of reverse repos is quite low. By offering an alternative to trades in the market, the reverse repo facility improves the bargaining position of lenders and drives rates, even if lenders rarely have to resort to the facility — a “spooky action at a distance” that also helps to keep the fed funds rate connected to other money market rates.2\n\nAs our balance sheet declines, so does the supply of reserves. Eventually, reserves could become scarce again, which would, theoretically, make it possible to return to a classic corridor system in which interest on reserves operates as a firm floor on market rates. Exactly what level of reserves would enable that is a topic of ongoing research. That level could be substantially larger than the last time we conducted policy in a reserves-scarce environment, owing to how much has changed since 2008. I will therefore continue to monitor this issue as the balance sheet shrinks.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is, by and large, farther down the road to normal than other countries that turned to unconventional policies and, as such, we can pass along the lessons of our experiences thus far. These are clearly not direct correlations, but there are echoes, and we all operate on the fundamental monetary policy oath of “first do no harm.”\n\nThe knowledge that rates and the balance sheet can be decoupled has been invaluable, as has the work to prepare the markets for what’s to come.\n\nThis is a new path for all of us. What we’re trying has never been done before, at least not on this scale, and while it might be, to borrow a phrase, the “final frontier” of monetary policy, I do believe we’ll pull off the ultimate feat and make a couple trillion dollars utterly uninteresting.\n\nWith that, I’m happy to take any questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Michael Dotsey, Shigeru Fujita, and Tom Stark, “Do Phillips Curves Conditionally Help to Forecast Inflation?” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Working Paper 17-26, August 2017.\n\n[2]Roc Armenter and Ben Lester, “Excess Reserves and Monetary Policy Implementation,” Review of Economic Dynamics, 23, (2017), pp. 212–235.",

        "content": "Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here today.\n\nSome speeches start with jokes. Fed speeches start with a disclaimer: The views I express here today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to say how great it is to have such a diverse group of stakeholders here. The Fed brings a lot of research and talent to bear in the community development sphere, but we’re only as successful as our partners make us, so thank you.\n\nI think all of us have questions we’re asked regularly about our jobs. When I was in academia, that was mostly, “Can I have an extension?” The ones I hear now, other than “When are you raising rates?” often fall into the category of “Why does the Fed care about equitable transit? Why do you care about affordable housing? What does community development have to do with monetary policy?”\n\nAnd I suppose on its face, it may not be evident. But the American economy is not a monolith; it’s a collection of regions and businesses and households that are themselves a series of microeconomies making up the whole. We are stronger as a country when every link in that chain is economically sound. Ensuring that all our communities are economically stable and sustainable is important to everyone.\n\nAs for the rest of it — things like housing and transportation — they are the factors that help turn economic aspiration into reality.\n\nWhich is why we’re here today. I’m an engineer by training, by the way, so I can talk about transportation for hours. People already think Fed presidents are boring policy wonks. Imagine getting stuck next to me at dinner parties, expounding on the wonders of bus routes … But I have actually managed to get people to listen because transit-related issues can affect so many other economic factors.\n\nEconomic Growth & Mobility Project\n\nAs you all probably know, the Philadelphia Fed has launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project that looks for practical applications for research. In fact, this summit on equitable transit is part of our first Research in Action project. I’d normally save the “thank yous” until the end of my remarks, but we wouldn’t be here today without our partners. So, for making this possible, a quick note of thanks to our partners in forming the Equitable Transit Council, the Scranton Area Community Foundation, and Laura Ducceschi, its president and CEO. Thank you also to Teri Ooms, executive director of The Institute for Public Policy and Economic Development at Wilkes University. And thanks to all the members of the Equitable Transit Council for your commitment to collaboration.\n\nBack to the Economic Growth & Mobility Project. The EGMP focuses on three key areas: job creation, workforce development, and infrastructure.\n\nWe often refer to these as the three legs of the mobility stool, but we could also call them strands of DNA because they’re inextricably laced and are core parts of mobility’s being.\n\nWe can have the best workforce development in the world, and we can create jobs at lightning pace. But if people can’t afford to live near the training, or find a way to get to the jobs, it won’t do much good. We have to look at the whole picture, not just what we need to get the economy moving, but how to make it happen. A central focus is, obviously, jobs, and we’re dealing with a few different issues in the labor market right now.\n\nFirst, not everyone is looking at the same employment realities. On a national level, there’s very little slack left in the labor market. Unemployment is at 4.2 percent, and the other data — for instance, job openings and quits — also point to a pretty tight market. But that’s a national average, and there are areas around the country that don’t share that good fortune.\n\nSecond, in a market that’s tight overall, we wind up with a different problem: Employers can’t find workers with the right skills. If they can’t fill those positions, they can’t expand their businesses, and that affects growth.\n\nThird, we are dealing with a low labor force participation rate. And as the baby boomers continue their march into retirement — and continue to live longer, to which I say “Go, boomers!” — the United States will have more people needing more services for more time. And while the millennial generation is technically a bit bigger, they’re not all fully in the workforce yet, and even the oldest aren’t quite in their prime earning years. Research by my staff shows that the labor force participation rate, which is currently just above 63 percent, will likely drop a couple more tenths of a percentage point over the next few years. Since growth is fundamentally growth in productivity plus growth in the labor force, there’s a real incentive for us to get every last person off the sidelines that we possibly can.\n\nWe need to get workers to jobs. We need to get potential workers to training. We need to reach as many of them as possible. And we need to do it in an equitable way. Which brings us back to the subject of transportation.\n\nEquitable Transportation and Economic Health\n\nWhile transit is a central issue for everyone’s economic health, the issues with transit aren’t the same for everyone. They vary by geography and size, by resources and need.\n\nNortheastern Pennsylvania, like the rest of the country, has a transportation system that grew in the latter half of the 20th century. Those systems reflected the way we lived: We moved to the suburbs and worked in the city and therefore, reasonably, designed systems to bring people into and out of the city center. Now that jobs are booming in distribution centers and office parks on the outskirts of town, we need to rethink how those systems can get people to jobs.\n\nOf course, jobs aren’t the only issue. There are other ways transportation impacts people’s lives and their path to economic growth and mobility. Prosperity is more than a number on a balance sheet. To be fully economically healthy, we need to take into account all aspects of a person or family or community’s assets that aren’t numerically or monetarily defined. Things like access to quality health care and education affect our ability to move up the economic ladder as well. So it’s important to get people to jobs but also to doctors’ appointments and school and the grocery store.\n\nIf you live in a city with a large transportation system and lots of options, it’s easy to forget that in substantial portions of the country, if you don’t have a car, you’re out of luck. But even in larger metro areas, equitable transit is an issue. There was an article in the New York Times a few months ago about the effect of skyrocketing real estate prices pushing people farther and farther from where they work. A woman they profiled in the Bay Area leaves home at 4:00 a.m. to start work at 7:00. Another article this summer, about the New York metro area, was titled, “You Have a Bad Commute? Try Four Hours and Three Trains.”\n\nThe benefit in this region is that we have the ability to be nimble. We don’t have legacy infrastructure to redesign and adapt on the scale a larger area does. I can tell you from experience; I spent a summer in college working in the New York City subway. This was back in 1980, and I lived down in the tunnels from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for the entire summer, running prototypes of upgraded subway cars. Even back then, we had to work to update an old network. Since the existing infrastructure here is not as broad, we have the opportunity to imagine a more perfect system without those constraints. We have the ability to build an equitable system that works for everyone. We may have the challenge that most areas face of balancing budgets while trying to meet user needs, but we also have the space to be creative and agile. And while the budgetary issues are not insignificant, there are great examples of public-private partnerships out there as well as investment opportunities for the private sector.\n\nThere’s also great potential in operating as a region. This is something I think is important, particularly in the context of infrastructure development. We don’t all live and work in the same place; our lives and economic fates cross city and county and state lines all the time. With a region comprising three principal cities — Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton — as well as many boroughs and towns in between, that connection and collaboration is even more critical.\n\nSo, as we look to use our assets to build a better system, what are users’ needs? We’ve been working with a range of partners to figure out how to best serve the people of northeastern Pennsylvania, including running focus groups in partnership with Wilkes University. The feedback was important to understanding what and where the needs are.\n\nWe heard that users’ top destinations are health care and shopping and that the inability to get out to the industrial parks and distribution centers is hurting job prospects. We also heard that schedules are an issue, which makes sense. Not everyone works 9 to 5.\n\nAs we develop new systems in response to those needs, we have an opportunity to be a model for other areas. In such a large and diverse country, we can’t always use the same approaches — Scranton and San Francisco have very different requirements. But Scranton and Stockton might not. There are areas across the map that can learn from our future successes.\n\nResearch in Action\n\nThat’s one reason Research in Action is central to our Economic Growth & Mobility Project. We want to take the data and apply them to problems in our District but also have those areas serve as models for others.\n\nMy team has done a lot of research in conjunction with the Atlanta and Cleveland Feds on what they call “opportunity occupations,” jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require a traditional four-year college degree. They know what industries those jobs are in and where they are geographically. This is going to be central to the work we’re doing here — not just getting people to jobs but getting people to good jobs.\n\nThey’re also working to put numbers behind the question of how public transit impacts job access. They’re mapping the footprint of the existing transit networks and looking at how access to opportunity occupations using those networks varies across neighborhoods with different income and educational attainment levels.\n\nAdditionally, since we know that budget constraints are an issue for a lot of areas, our researchers have assembled examples of investment by financial institutions that meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements, which can help bring funders and partners to the table. One is a Cars for Careers partnership between a bank and a local nonprofit in the D.C. area. The bank provides affordable loans to low- and moderate-income clients to buy used cars that have been donated to the program. Another institution in Oregon is donating tax credits to the local public transit system and free dial-a-ride transportation for seniors and people with disabilities.\n\nConclusion\n\nI said at the beginning of my remarks that the issues at the center of economic growth and mobility are intertwined and inextricable from the overall economic health of a region. They also have effects that span farther than each individual.\n\nTransportation is essential to getting most people to jobs, and a region with low unemployment is stronger economically. A wider revenue base can mean more investment in education and infrastructure, and it can mean more investment in the community — which, in turn, can bring in more businesses and encourage more economic growth.\n\nTransportation can also be central to health care and education. That’s the current and rising American workforce, and keeping people healthy and educated will make that workforce stronger.\n\nTransportation is not, obviously, the only aspect of infrastructure that affects economic health, but it is significant and it touches many others. And the work we’re doing in northeastern Pennsylvania will help us here and serve as a model for others.\n\nWith that, I’m happy to take any questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

        "content": "Good morning and thank you.\n\nThat’s honestly one of the most impactful parts of being a Fed president: getting to see the real-life implications of the data I view on a daily basis and how it translates into life in my District and around the country. Talking to employers and job seekers and educators just resonates more than a line on a graph.\n\nI’m going to talk today about several different aspects of workforce development, each of which can truly bring about phenomenal results. And I don’t necessarily have a favorite program or approach, but sometimes the work speaks to you on a personal level.\n\nThe video you just saw was of the Philly Shipyard’s apprenticeship program. You may have heard me say that I grew up in a family of steamfitters and pipefitters. My brother was a welder, my uncles were all pipefitters, as was my dad for a long time.\n\nI saw how those jobs, those careers, gave people solid, middle-class lives, even without a college degree. I’m the result of that. I’m the beneficiary of a time and a place that offered a host of railways to the terminus of financial security. What you saw in that video was a program that can provide exactly that opportunity for this next generation of Americans. You saw people from all walks of life. Samantha, the young woman, has a B.F.A.; she’s a former artist. You saw that they were of all different ages — Shawn started the program in his 40s. And most of all, you saw that each of them feels an incredible world of opportunity is open to them because of this apprenticeship program. It’s not just a job, it’s a career — all of those people see a clear path up the company ladder. At a time when a lot of people have lost hope that fortune can favor anyone without a traditional four-year degree, it’s heartening to see those prospects alive and well.\n\nIt’s not all about the workers, however. On the flip side, companies can increase quality and output by stocking their ranks with incredibly skilled people. As people learn, adapt, and acquire new skills, the program can hone in on ways to make outcomes even better. And overall, organizations can minimize their risk by knowing they’ve got highly trained, expert tradespeople making up their workforce.\n\nIt’s a win-win.\n\nSo apprenticeships aren’t necessarily my favorite of all the workforce development approaches we’ll talk about over the course of this conference, but they do have a special place for me.\n\nIn light of that personal observation, let me assure you, with the familiar Fed disclaimer, that all the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Research\n\nSo, why am I here today? They don’t just trot out the presidents at these events, they make us earn it …\n\nAnd I’m here to talk about a really substantive report we’ve just released as a System, Investing in America’s Workforce: Report on Workforce Development Needs and Opportunities.\n\nThe impetus for this research was the CRA clarification that allows banks to include workforce development as an investment opportunity. And I want to stress that word: investment. Because I’m going to be using it a lot over the next 20 minutes or so.\n\nThis report is essentially about the value of investing in our combined economic future. So whether this work is directly relevant to someone, we all have a lot to gain from its success.\n\nThe Fed has a dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment — ultimately, we’re creating the conditions for economic growth. But those conditions won’t be as fertile if we can’t fill the jobs that are out there now, not to mention the ones coming in the future. The U.S. can only reach its potential when the needs of both business and the labor force are addressed in stronger alignment. So, we took a deep dive into what’s happening now and what we need to plan for the future.\n\nCommunity Development teams from across the Federal Reserve System gathered information in more than 50 listening sessions, across 32 states and Puerto Rico, from almost 1,000 workforce development leaders who work at the intersection of training, recruitment, and finance.\n\nMy team used qualitative research methods to find central themes from industry respondents: They talked about the challenges they’ve observed across the country but also the promising strategies they see as well as opportunities for investment in workforce development.\n\nA lot of the findings reflect what we see in the data and what we’re hearing from our community and business contacts across the country.\n\nBut what makes this report stand out is the approaches they used. It let them take a deep and broad look at the insights shared by using a rigorous, qualitative research method.\n\nFor me, the methodology and the findings confirm the unique role of Community Development in the Fed System.\n\nI often make the observation that while we make monetary policy on a national level, that’s the 30,000-foot vantage point. It’s a combined view of myriad microeconomies made up of regions and businesses and households. That’s why our decentralized system is so important: It allows us to really understand our Districts and their specific needs on an in-depth, local level.\n\nThat same understanding of the unique needs of the communities we serve is what makes the Community Development function so crucial and what adds so much value. They’ve got depth and breadth of understanding and an interconnected system of networks that provides insight on this vast and diverse collection of economies.\n\nChallenges in the Workforce\n\nSo, what are we working with?\n\nA lot of what we heard in the listening sessions reflects what I see in the data. The JOLTS data, for instance, and the Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey (MBOS), both show a skills gap. The MBOS shows that compared with 2014, the respondents identifying a labor shortage this year jumped from about 33 percent to over 60 percent. And the ones who saw a skills mismatch went from about 46 percent to around 68 percent.\n\nOf course, there are other issues. Everyone here is familiar with the factors that impact or limit people’s ability to enter the workforce, to find jobs that can support a family, or even to progress up the career ladder.\n\nThis report highlighted some of the factors we know contribute to these hurdles. They include the skills gap I mentioned, low educational attainment or poor quality of education, and a change in employer needs and demands due to increasing automation and technical advancement.\n\nThe research also highlighted the barriers that aren’t related to skills, like addiction, incarceration, child-care costs.\n\nThere are also logistical impediments; in the case of housing and insufficient transportation — the simple consequence of place.\n\nAnd there is the issue of job quality. While we’re essentially at the point of maximum employment — in its simplest terms, if you want a job, you can get one relatively easily — that doesn’t mean it’s a good job, or that it pays a living wage, or that it comes with the benefits that can be truly family-sustaining.\n\nThis situation doesn’t actually keep people from work, but it does affect their ability to move up the economic ladder.\n\nAnd that’s not just a problem for individuals, families, and communities but for the economy as a whole.\n\nLooking at these barriers, they’re each a brick in the wall, one that stands between people and either sustainable employment or economic mobility.\n\nSo, how do we chip away at the bricks? How do we knock that wall down?\n\nWhat we heard in the listening sessions, and what a lot of experts and practitioners say, is that there needs to be a change in perspective.\n\nThat shift in thinking is going to be a theme because, sometimes, it’s all about how we view things. When we change the way we look at things, those things can start to change. None of us is static, and none of us can view our work or our challenges through a single lens. The research showed that experts truly believe that a change in thinking will lead to a change in behavior, which can lead to a change in outcomes.\n\nThe Shift in Thinking: Public Sector\n\nSo, what for instance, would that mean for the public sector?\n\nWe heard consistently, and it is a central theme in the report, that we have got to stop looking at workforce development as just a social service. I mean everyone. We need to look at it for what it is: an investment in the American economy.\n\nIf we stop looking at workforce development as a cost and start looking at the long-term return on investment, we can change the conversation and the approaches.\n\nFrom a purely economic standpoint, early childhood education isn’t an expenditure; it’s an investment in our future workforce. It’s an investment in the next generation of entrepreneurs and health-care workers and teachers.\n\nLikewise, investing in workforce development doesn’t just benefit individuals; it helps create the workforce our businesses need.\n\nIf we ignore that investment opportunity, we aren’t just losing the economic resources; we’re likely creating a cohort that could actually be a cost.\n\nIn the same vein, we heard that we need to better align overlapping goals, like workforce development and economic development efforts. Or investing in intermediaries that connect people to jobs — not just the ones that train workers but the ones that train with an eye on what the industry’s future needs will be.\n\nAnd one of the key messages we heard was that people involved in this work need to start thinking like investors who look at long-term outcomes, rather than lenders that look at short-term risks.\n\nInvestors succeed when the company they’re backing does well. The U.S. economy succeeds when we back programs that move people out of poverty and into stable, sustainable employment.\n\nAnd when we shift to an investor mindset, it creates opportunities for financial institutions to become strategic partners.\n\nFor example, there’s a new fund in Philadelphia that allows banks to work with a CDFI intermediary to drive capital to early childhood education. This is important because we know it’s a two-generation strategy: helping the working generation find steady employment and knowing their children are getting the skills they need to be successful now and in the future.\n\nThe Shift in Thinking: Private Sector\n\nSo, what shift in thinking would they like to see in the private sector? Employers looking at their workers as assets to be invested in, rather a line-item labor cost to be limited or decreased. If employers do that, our experts believe their behavior might also change.\n\nThey may increase incumbent worker training or professional development opportunities. Those approaches both increase the skills of their current workforce and, as people start to move up within an organization, create entry-level positions to bring in a new generation of talent.\n\nIt could also encourage apprenticeship programs and work-based training. We know from experience that we’re especially successful when people can learn and earn, supporting their families while increasing their skills.\n\nSo, if private sector partners can shift their thinking, we’re more likely to see an increase in job quality, which is important. We’re in a tight labor market right now, but we aren’t creating quality jobs within that market; we won’t see as big of an economic impact.\n\nWhat did our listening session participants want from the financial institution side? They suggested favorable funding so businesses can invest in their workforce, which in turn can contribute to the overall virtuous economic cycle. In California, for example, lenders are providing reduced-cost capital to businesses that are committed to improving job quality over time or offering quality jobs.\n\nThe Shift in Thinking: Philanthropy\n\nAnd what did we hear from the philanthropic side? An invitation to be bold. Because philanthropy has the freedom to use real ingenuity.\n\nFoundations can use their capital to promote innovation, collaboration, and capacity building; they can be venture philanthropists.\n\nWe know that shifting thinking and perspectives isn’t always easy. We also know that it’s often not lack of funding — but lack of risk tolerance — that stops new approaches and innovations. Philanthropy is the group that’s able to take on that risk and prove best practices. They can be the catalysts for innovation and capacity building across the community development field.\n\nIf they can be the ones to bring their risk appetite up a notch, take the lead on facilitating increased collaboration and capacity building, and use those to prove best practices, they may be able to leverage additional investment based on solid track records.\n\nWe heard from a lot of people that there’s a need for this kind of leadership and support to address challenges the best way the respondents see: holistically.\n\nInstead of having very restrictive capital and rigid reporting requirements, organizations can be empowered to think about how they’re investing and building capacity to meet the needs of their clients, the same way venture capitalists would invest in the capacity of businesses they want to succeed.\n\nSo, instead of paying for services or funding services, they’re funding outcomes. And by doing that, we’re giving organizations flexibility and trust and the space to better meet the unique needs of their clients. Those organizations can become more nimble, more sustainable, and able to operate more effectively in the context of the complex challenges they’re facing.\n\nThis is also an opportunity for lenders to provide impact because they, rightfully, have to think about limiting risk. They can’t take on the more adventurous investments that foundations can, but they can support the capacity building that organizations need by offering flexible financial products.\n\nFor example, we heard that in order to effectively train people for the jobs of today and tomorrow, one of the pressing needs is cutting-edge, high-tech equipment. Which is expensive. So banks offering affordable financing can help organizations meet those challenges.\n\nConclusions and Next Steps\n\nThose challenges aren’t small. We wouldn’t all be here if they were. But the changes in perspective we heard overwhelmingly in our research, the different approaches we all talk about wanting, can yield game-changing results.\n\nRemember the barriers? The bricks that fit together to make the wall higher and harder to scale?\n\nIf we change the way we look at it, we see how it might change.\n\nClimbing isn’t necessarily easy. But with the insight we’ve already heard today; with the approaches our research participants highlighted; and with the capacity and talent of stakeholders from the public, private, and philanthropic sectors, we can absolutely turn that wall on its side.\n\nThose steps form the ascendant path of economic mobility, and they’re a climb everyone should have a chance at.\n\nAs many of you know, we’ve recently launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project at the Philadelphia Fed, and this is exactly what we’re focused on.\n\nIn addition to our work on the Investing in America’s Workforce report, we recently released an apprenticeship guide for business. We are also currently exploring ways to put some of the investment opportunities we’ve found through this research into action in the Third District.\n\nI truly believe we’ll have people lining up to partner in this work if we can change people’s perspectives. I met with a group of CEOs last week, and they confirmed that this is work the business community is crying out for.\n\nBefore I turn it over to questions, I obviously can’t end without the requisite, and well-deserved, shout-outs. To our colleagues across the System who hosted listening sessions and collaborated on this research: They’ve all done an incredible job contributing to the report. And to my team, of course; in particular, Theresa Singleton for her leadership and Noelle St.Clair for all her work on this report.\n\nI also want to thank our other colleagues across the Federal Reserve System and at the Board of Governors, our partners in the room today and those that couldn’t make it out to Austin, and those who have given their time and insight throughout the conference by speaking and sharing their work. I’m looking forward to the rest of it.\n\nWith that, I’m more than happy to take some questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

        "content": "Hello and welcome; it’s great to have everyone here.\n\nI’m going to keep my remarks to a minimum today, but I do want to take some time to express what I think is truly one of the most important areas of modern economic research. Which, being just one of the many opinions I’m going to share in the next 10 minutes, is a good place to stop to deliver the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nIn 2001, one of my predecessors stood on this very stage at the first Consumer Transactions and Credit conference, making the case for the newly launched Payment Cards Center (PCC). Today, I’ll be making the case for that center’s evolution. In some ways, there may as well be a century and a half, rather than a decade and a half, separating our two discussions. In others, some messages from that conference still resonate today.\n\nReading Anthony Santomero’s remarks with the benefit of 16 years’ perspective is a lesson in the power of research and, given the prescience of his case, something of an exercise in humility.\n\nHis view back then was that individuals’ use of consumer credit and payments had been relatively neglected in the research community. That was starting to change with the emergence of ever more complex financial vehicles, particularly relating to the mortgage market. But, by and large, he said we were still a long way from a sophisticated model of household decisions on spending, saving, borrowing, and allocation of assets. He said that “In short, the detailed payoff patterns associated with the debt instruments issued by the agent were entirely too mundane for the theorists’ consideration.”\n\nWhat a difference a few years would make and how much we all wish those instruments had actually been mundane.\n\nToday, the place of consumer credit and payments, and its attendant research, is markedly different than it was in 2001. But the foundation of the Philadelphia Fed’s continued focus remains the same: The Third District is home to the credit card industry, and we have years of research and expertise dedicated to the study of all things consumer.\n\nSo today, I’m incredibly pleased to say that we’re building on that legacy and the work of the Payment Cards Center by launching the Consumer Finance Institute (CFI).\n\nThis is an evolution rather than a rebranding or a new initiative. The Payment Cards Center will contribute to the CFI, along with researchers in our Supervision, Regulation, and Credit; Community Development Studies & Education; and Research departments. Our goal is to make the Consumer Finance Institute a primary source within the Federal Reserve System for consumer finance data and research.\n\nI hold the relatively straightforward belief that we should play to our strengths, and this expansion is an expression not only of the importance of consumer finance but the skill and expertise of our staff.\n\nWe’ve built on the great work of Bob Hunt, Julia Cheney, and the team in the PCC and created a new consumer finance section in our Economic Research group, led by Satyajit Chatterjee. Chatty will be joined by Wenli Li, and I’d like to take a moment to welcome Igor Livshits and Andrew Hertzberg. Just a plug for our fantastic research team, and a thanks for their work. I’d advise everyone to look out for Andrew’s upcoming article in The Journal of Finance. It’s a great example of how the close study of household behavior — in this case, understanding that households are actually made up of interdependent individuals — gives us valuable, and surprising, insights into consumption behavior. That’s important on a number of levels but particularly from my perspective as a monetary policymaker.\n\nWhich leads me to something I find so surprising about Anthony Santomero’s words not too many years ago. The absence of a fully developed field of robust research on consumer credit fundamentally indicates that we didn’t acknowledge that it touches every aspect of the economy. Consumer issues are intertwined and interwoven, inextricable from virtually every economic issue. From entitlement programs to business formation to health care, as Nathan Blascak is going to present later today, there’s nothing in the economy consumer credit doesn’t touch.\n\nPerhaps it’s simply more stark in the wake of the financial crisis and its aftermath, but it seems to me there’s no way to look at the economy without factoring in the work and research you all are doing.\n\nSo I’m going to let you get on with that discussion, now that I’ve shamelessly plugged all the great work of the staff here at the Philadelphia Fed. I want to thank the conference organizers, who reviewed 140 submissions this year, and Mike Dotsey, our director of Research, for his role in overseeing the CFI and realigning some of his research team to work in such an important area.\n\nWith that, thanks for coming and enjoy the rest of your day.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

        "content": "Good morning. It’s truly a pleasure to be here, and I want to extend my sincerest thanks to everyone who made today possible. This is an incredibly important topic, and the more people we can bring to the table, the better. There’s been a growing interest in apprenticeships in the area — in everything from IT to health care to financial services — and their success is a testament to the power of public-private partnerships.\n\nI’m going to do something a bit different today. Normally, the policymaker would get up and recite key statistics, which, frankly, is our comfort zone. You notice no one ever calls a monetary policymaker to host the Tonys.\n\nAnd while it’s not quite a Broadway number — the only one I’m qualified for is Hamilton, and believe me, you don’t want to hear me in a rap battle over central banking — I’m going to leave the heavy data to today’s expert presenters. I will, of course, address workforce development from a policy perspective, but I’m also going to add a bit of the personal. Which counts as really shaking things up in Fed world.\n\nThat’s the segue to the reason I’m here: Why, exactly, does the Fed care about workforce development?\n\nI should note that the answer to that question — along with everything else I say today — reflects my thoughts alone and not necessarily anyone else’s in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nWith that duly noted, there are actually a few reasons I care about workforce development. For one, it helps the Fed meet one of the goals set for us by Congress: maximum employment. For another, a better educated and more skilled workforce benefits us all, whether it’s more innovation, better goods and services, or additional revenue flowing into the economy. But there’s also my sincere belief that everyone should have a fair shot at success. That means developing skills that can help them get there, and apprenticeships are a critical tool.\n\nI think all areas of training are important, but I’m especially focused on how we address the changing landscape of the American workforce at a pivotal time in history. Now, to be fair, “pivotal time in history” is probably one of the most overused speech lines out there. But I honestly believe we’re experiencing a confluence of events that makes the needs and challenges of the labor market unique to our time. We’ve endured the biggest crisis since the Great Depression, and we’re finally emerging from its shadow. We’re seeing demographic changes — like the first wave of baby boom retirements — that are fundamentally altering the composition of the labor force. We’re in the midst of sustained technological change that has indeed disrupted many industries, with apologies for using a buzzword. And we’re seeing a skills gap that’s affecting employers and job seekers alike.\n\nWhile there’s some debate over the extent of the gap, research by my staff shows it is a real issue, even in a labor market with very little slack left. And while data are not, I admit, the plural of anecdote, I’ve been hearing it from employers across the region as well. They have jobs but can’t find people with the skills to fill them. Meanwhile, there are people who’d love the work but don’t have the training to qualify.\n\nSkills training in general, and apprenticeships in particular, can help to address this gap. We need more investment, and more involvement, to truly make a difference. And we need a cultural shift as well. That won’t necessarily be easy — as someone who spent a lifetime in academia, I can attest to the difficulty of cultural change — but it is definitely necessary.\n\nSomething that’s characterized America since our inception is that we’re incredibly creative. We excel at industries as varied as the physical landscape of the country. We’ve revolutionized so many sectors, and every day we see more examples of how we’re adapting our ways and methods of working to keep up with that change. Yet at the same time, we’ve become more and more rigid about the paths to success. We seem to be locked into the idea that the only way to access and advance in a career is through a four-year degree.\n\nThat has to change.\n\nThere are many ways to acquire skills. We know now more than ever that people learn in different ways. Not everyone is programmed to pick up information in a classroom setting. Not everyone wants or needs or should get a traditional bachelor’s degree. And not everyone who wants one needs to do so immediately.\n\nAnd that’s OK. That’s good. We need to stack our workforce with people who think and solve and learn differently. Apprenticeships aren’t just an alternative; they’re a smart, first-choice path, and we should view them that way. They’ve stood the test of time for a reason.\n\nApprenticeships go back to ancient Egypt and Babylon; they were so important they were enshrined in the Code of Hammurabi back in the 18th century BC.\n\nFrom the late middle ages, apprenticeships guaranteed a path to employment and maintenance or rise in social status. They were a hallmark of the Renaissance and made an important economic contribution during one of the great periods in human history.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was an apprentice; so were George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Paul Revere. There is incredible nobility and history there, and we should celebrate that.\n\nApprenticeships have changed and adapted to the needs of shifting economic landscapes over time. But some things have persisted, and they are important. First, apprenticeships can be a path to economic mobility. The road from apprenticeship to journeyman to artisan is as viable today as it was in da Vinci’s time. Second, the required concentration on skill not only maintains the quality of a trade, it fosters the kind of expertise that can lead to innovation.\n\nThe change in attitudes I’d like to see was evident when I visited Roxborough High School last year. They have an Academies program that allows students to pick a course of concentration while they study the regular curriculum. It’s not an apprenticeship program but shares some of the characteristics, including setting the students up to enter the workforce directly from high school. They can earn a good salary if they want to work for a few years before returning to school, they can work part-time while continuing their education, or they can just start their climb up the professional ladder immediately. Programs like this are a great entryway to what my staff has termed “opportunity occupations”: jobs that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a college degree. They did research with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds to identify not just where this work is in terms of sector but actually where they are geographically.\n\nThe students at Roxborough know that the skills they’re getting give them a leg up in the job market, and I hope that their attitudes toward creative paths to education and training will soon be the prevailing ones. We all have our own ways of getting to the endpoint, and, if we want our labor market running on all cylinders, we need a workforce that is as innovative and creative as the sectors they represent.\n\nOne of the great things about apprenticeships is that they’re useful at any stage in life. I visited Philly Shipyard a few weeks ago, which has one of the most well-established programs in the region, and met apprentices in their 20s and 30s. One of them was Samantha, who went to art school and has a B.F.A. But she decided she wanted to go down a different path and joined the apprenticeship program. She’s now one of the top welders. Her creative and innovative talents as an artist translated into incredible skill at welding. She loves what she does and, almost as importantly, sees real growth potential and opportunity in the company.\n\nShe and the rest of the apprentices aren’t just getting the skills to become masters of their trade; they’re getting the sanctuary of seeing a solid path to not just stability but success.\n\nI grew up in a blue-collar neighborhood in New Jersey, where my sister and I were the first in our family to go to college. I could tell you that back then, you could get a high school diploma, or go to community college, and still live a comfortable, middle-class life — and that was definitely true for some people. But it wasn’t true for everyone; some people never had the access to that security or had to work twice as hard. And it’s frankly less achievable for most people now. But I still think it should be a path available to everyone.\n\nIt’s probably more resonant coming off the July 4 holiday, but the core ethos of the American dream — that if you work hard, you can get ahead — is still something quite profound. We just need better ways for people to get there. Skills training and apprenticeships can help.\n\nHere’s where I go back to being a typical policymaker by plugging my staff’s work: If anyone here wants more information, the Philadelphia Fed has recently published a guide to apprenticeships in our area to provide private sector organizations with information on how you can get involved. Copies are available to everyone, and, since Keith Rolland is responsible, you can corner him and ask him all the questions you want in person. It’s good for the workforce, and it’s good for business.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

        "content": "Good afternoon and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be in London and a special pleasure to be standing in the truly beautiful Palace of Westminster.\n\nPeople generally invite a Fed president to speak about the U.S. economy, and I certainly plan to oblige. So today, I’d like to start with an outlook and discussion of my view of the path of monetary policy. But I’d also like to address something that binds not just our two countries but nations across the globe: international trade.\n\nI’m standing in a building that is steeped in history and tradition, from Black Rod and the Queen’s Speech to the dragging of the Speaker in the House of Commons. So, I feel a need to honor that tradition by sharing one of our own. And while our history is obviously shorter in term than yours, this is nonetheless a time-honored Fed custom: the standard disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nU.S. Outlook\n\nWith that, I’ll start off with a snapshot of the American economy.\n\nGrowth for 2017 so far is more or less what we expected. The first quarter was relatively weak, which has been the case for first quarters over the past several years. That’s what we’ve come to expect at this point, so it’s not cause for alarm. This year’s 1.2 percent Q1 growth was influenced by factors I believe are transient, like weather, seasonality, and low inventory investment. I expect second quarter growth to rebound and overall GDP growth for 2017 to average about 2.3 percent.\n\nI’m aware of the pitfalls of economic forecasting — I believe the old maxim is that economists are people who will know tomorrow why the things they predicted yesterday didn’t happen today. But I’ll tempt fate by saying that I predict growth of just above 2 percent for 2018 and 2019. That’s assuming that things unfold the way they have been. And if things do continue on their current path, that’s frankly the rate of growth we should consider normal in the U.S.\n\nInflation has been a hot topic of conversation recently. The latest PCE numbers are from April, which show a downtick in both headline and core inflation, to 1.7 and 1.5 percent year-on-year, respectively. That was the second report in a row that had PCE heading in the wrong direction. Coupled with the most recent CPI data for May, which makes for the third of those reports to trend downward, it’s prompted a lot of questions for Fed policymakers. Will soft inflation data derail our normalization plans?\n\nI make this point frequently, but policymakers are wont to be repetitive, so I’ll make it again. It’s a mistake to get caught up in a single decimal point, report, or even a quarter’s worth of data. The importance lies in underlying trends, and, in the case of inflation, I’ve seen the factors exerting downward pressure as temporary. That said, the Fed is data dependent, and, as information comes in, there’s the possibility that those transitory factors may be less transitory than we thought.\n\nFor the meantime, therefore, I’m sticking to my outlook that we’re on the right path, but I’m adjusting my view slightly on meeting our inflation goal from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018. This is the advanced economic practice of “hedging one’s bets.”\n\nAs for the labor market, I see very little slack left. The most recent data show an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, the lowest the U.S. has seen in 16 years. That’s either at or below the natural rate and reflects a steady tightening over the course of the expansion. I see that rate edging down even further over the course of the next couple of years before moving a few tenths of a percentage point back up again.\n\nJob creation remains strong, and you can see clearly in the JOLTS data that openings and quits continue to indicate a fairly tight market. I think we’ll see an average of about 190,000 jobs a month for this year, which should fall to about 100,000 jobs a month by the end of 2019. Many headlines and commentators have responded to any month of job creation below 200,000 with, in my opinion, overreaction; much of the narrative around May’s 138,000 number was anguished. But it was a good number for where we are right now. As we move forward on a downward glide path over the next couple of years, eventually reaching a pace of about 100,000 jobs a month, we should remember: That’s going to be more than adequate to keep pace with population growth.\n\nAn area I have been hoping to see more improvement in is wage growth, and we’re finally starting to see some upward pressure. I see wage growth of about 2.5 to 3 percent this year, which is very welcome.\n\nBased on the strength of the economy, therefore, I still support the continued gradual removal of accommodation.\n\nI still see another rate hike as appropriate for 2017, having already implemented two this year.\n\nAnd we’ve recently announced the plan to unwind our $4.5 trillion balance sheet. We debated a number of options but ultimately decided on a reduction of reinvestment in both Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. It will start off slowly, build gradual momentum, and begin sometime this year — though I don’t want to tie that to a date in the calendar or a rung on the inflation ladder. It will be predictable to the point of boredom; we will communicate our intentions clearly, with a good amount of lead time; and once the process commences, it will be essentially on autopilot.\n\nThe caveat, of course, is that this is dependent on things continuing to unfold as they have been. To adopt an adage from my host country this evening, policymakers agree with Macmillan on what we’re wary of: “Events, dear boy, events.”\n\nThose events can take many forms, and, in the years following the financial crisis and subsequent recession in most of the world, we were reminded that sometimes they come from outside our own borders. I’m aware that the U.S. in some cases is more resilient; we’re the ones who give the world the proverbial cold when we sneeze. But we’re not immune. All our economies have become more and more intertwined, and the discussion of national economics is now also a discussion of global economics.\n\nTrade Gains: The Classics\n\nThe fact is that all advanced economies rely on trade. It makes simple economic sense for nations to use their comparative advantages, focusing on goods that are relatively cheap for them to produce and importing those that are relatively expensive to make at home. International trade allows countries to focus on what they’re good at, rather than spending valuable time and resources attempting to produce every good they need.1 International trade also addresses cyclical ups and downs, letting countries borrow in the lean times and build nest eggs in the boom ones.\n\nMore importantly, many countries would fail to be completely self-sustaining, owing to the simple limitations of natural and other resources. But even a country like the United States, which covers enough diverse territory with multiple resources to source most of what we need, relies on trade, because our economy depends on selling to our partners.\n\nThen there is the overwhelming body of work arguing that trade fosters peace and cooperation. I don’t believe I’m allowed to deliver a speech in the United Kingdom without mentioning the great Adam Smith, so here’s my reference: From Adam Smith’s view of mutually beneficial trade relationships fostering harmony to Bastiat’s positing that trading nations will avoid war with one another, the idea that peace is wrought by intertwined economic fortunes is a well-established principle of economic thought.\n\nThe Production Chain Conundrum\n\nThat, however, is the philosophical, borne out by data as it may be. From the practical side, there is the reality that many supply chains have become as intertwined as global economies. Products whose provenance is a single country no longer make up the entirety of trade. A tractor, for instance, may be made out of raw materials shipped from Asia to South America for processing, then to North America to make the frame, then back to South America for finishing touches, then back to North America for sale, some domestically and some via the export market.\n\nWhile this is an extensive chain of custody for any one product, it’s generally done for efficiency’s sake, utilizing countries’ expertise and saving businesses money while delivering quality.2 It makes sense and benefits all parties involved.\n\nBut this kind of global production is particularly sensitive to trade protection because every time that tractor’s parts cross a border, they face a potential tariff.\n\nHere I will tread with extreme caution — I’m not in the business of dispensing advice to other policymakers, and I’m definitely not weighing in on trade policy for the U.S. or any other nation. From a purely economic perspective, however, our economies have become too integrated with one another to turn back. Trade on this level is unlikely to disappear — on the contrary, it’s likely to increase — and that means even modest tariffs, if they are applied several times over to the same production chain, would be enough to disrupt a host of industries.\n\nTrade’s Influence on Growth and Income\n\nThat would be a disservice to everyone, because trade is a net positive both on a national and individual level. Research shows that a 10 percent increase in trade is associated with a 5 percent increase in income per capita.3 Likewise, doubling a country’s trade share can lead to an increase in GDP of an estimated 25 percent over the span of a decade.\n\nHistory chronicles trade’s effects. Economic development from 1800 to 1980 saw a steady rise in global inequality precisely because only developed economies were open to trade. When previously closed economies subsequently opened up, the trend was reversed.4 China is just one — but perhaps the most discussed — example of how trade can rapidly reverse economic fates. Korea is another example, as are, increasingly, Vietnam and the Philippines.\n\nUltimately, international trade has helped mitigate global poverty: Although the world’s population grew by 1.6 billion between 1980 and 2000, the number of people living in extreme poverty actually declined by up to 200 million.5 While trade can’t take all the credit for that shift, it certainly played a role.6\n\nHarm over Help?\n\nIf trade’s benefits are so overwhelmingly positive, why has there been such animosity toward it? I think there are two reasons: First, there are common myths attached to trade and its effects. Second, there are, in fact, losers in the trade game, which is something we should take seriously.\n\nOne of the arguments against trade is the belief that low-wage countries unfairly compete against mature economies. Some believe this delivers the double blow of taking jobs away from developed countries while simultaneously allowing advanced economies to exploit their less developed counterparts.\n\nA more accurate depiction is that low wages go hand in hand with lower productivity, meaning less developed economies do not, on the whole, have an edge. Additionally, as trade in these goods shifts, it frees up resources in more developed economies, letting them concentrate on more specialized goods made by skilled workers, who, in turn, earn higher wages.\n\nAs for lower wage countries, the simple math is that, without trade, those wages would be even lower.\n\nThe Costs of Trade\n\nThat said, there are people who feel the downside of global trade more acutely than others.\n\nTrade, on the whole, is a benefit. It makes products cheaper, including necessities like food, and countries tend to reap the rewards on a macro level.\n\nBut the many who benefit don’t do so in a life-altering way; we aren’t moved by a price change of a few dollars or cents in our everyday purchases. In the case of the United States, the relatively abundant supply of skilled workers benefit, while the unskilled portion of the labor force can, in fact, lose out to competition from abroad.\n\nThe rewards are reaped in breadth, spread among the 320-plus million people who live in the U.S. Those who suffer, however, do so on a profound level. Entire industries and the populations that depend on them are affected. Those effects are big and are taken on by a small number of people, increasing their burden.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons jobs in certain sectors have disappeared. Automation, changes in market preferences, and other factors have contributed to industry shifts. So, while trade does have real effects for some workers, much of the debate is muddied by the multiple contributors.\n\nSo, what can we do to help the people who’ve been negatively affected?\n\nAgain, there isn’t much that can be done to stop the trade train. The natural state of the human condition is to search for not just subsistence but for substance, and opening the door to trade generally makes things better, faster, and more affordable.\n\nBut we have to do something to help those who are displaced or disadvantaged. This is something of a conundrum with a labor market with so little slack left. We’ve reached a point where the competition is among employers vying for candidates rather than applicants vying for jobs. While there’s some debate on the subject of the skills mismatch, research by my staff shows this is absolutely an issue. And while I know that the plural of “anecdote” isn’t “data,” it’s definitely something I’m hearing from the business community across my District. A businessman I know has doubled the bays for his trucking repair business to keep up with demand, but half of them are empty because he can’t find qualified mechanics. He’s paying salaries of over $100,000 a year, but he can’t fill the jobs. That’s because trucking repair doesn’t just involve basic maintenance anymore; it requires digital skills. It reflects what we’re consistently seeing: There are jobs but not enough people with the right training.\n\nI’m using examples from my District, but we’re seeing examples across the country. I should note that the Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks in Districts across the country, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. My District is the smallest, comprising about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and all of Delaware. In total, that’s a little less than half of the United Kingdom.7 So, small for the U.S., but not insignificant by any means. And it’s made up of multiple and diverse economies from postindustrial to rural, urban to suburban.\n\nOne solution to the skills gap is obviously training programs and more investment in practical education. My staff recently completed a guide to apprenticeships in our area to provide private sector organizations with information on how they can get involved. This is a good start, and the more research and data the better. But there also needs to be a cultural shift. At some point, vocational education took on a negative connotation, and that’s a problem. Education shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all. Not everyone wants or needs — or frankly should — take the traditional university route.\n\nMore research by my staff identified what they’re calling “opportunity occupations,” jobs that pay at or above the median wage but don’t require a traditional four-year degree. If we can be more strategic about the way we train our rising and existing workforce, we can benefit both workers and employers.\n\nWe can’t guarantee that every industry will be immune to whatever creative destruction comes its way. But we can instill a culture that prizes training and is therefore better able to adapt to change.\n\nAgain, I’m not telling anyone how to legislate. My only job is to offer data and economic reality.\n\nThat reality is that trade is not a zero sum game; a win for one country is not a loss for another. Rather, it is a contribution to a global market that ebbs and flows in an overall benefit to everyone.\n\nAnd international trade is an overall positive. There is nothing in this world that is without risks, and no progress comes without paradigm shifts. But we have it in our power to take those shifts and turn them to our advantage by thinking of new — and reprising old — ways of adapting to change.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]David Ricardo, On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.

        "content": "Good afternoon and welcome; it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economic outlook, including my views on monetary policy, then talk a bit about a subject that’s crucial to economic success on a local, regional, and national level but that often gets treated as a separate subject: economic growth and mobility.\n\nBefore I do that, let me perform the sacred Fed ritual of delivering the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System, including my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nI’ll start with the outlook, which, overall, is pretty good.\n\nFirst quarter GDP growth was quite weak. The most recent revision puts that number at 1.2 percent, which is better than the previous 0.7 percent estimate. This actually illustrates a point I want to make because I think it’s a mistake to give either number too much weight.\n\nWe’ve seen weak first quarter growth for several years now to the extent that it’s essentially become the new normal. This year’s culprits were weather, low inventory investment, and our old friend seasonality. These effects are likely transient, and they’ve proved to be so in the past. I project overall GDP growth of 2.3 percent for 2017, which is pretty much what we should consider normal for the medium term.\n\nTurning to inflation, things are still on track, despite a couple of months trending in the wrong direction. Both headline and core PCE ticked down in April, to 1.7 and 1.5 percent year-on-year, respectively, but I still think we’re doing fine. We spent a lot of the past few years waiting for inflation to rise to meet our 2 percent target. Now we’re on track, and two reports showing slight downward trends don’t derail my outlook.\n\nMuch like the disappointment over slow first quarter GDP growth, I think the concern over a couple of months of less-than-perfect inflation data is unwarranted.\n\nWe’re essentially at normal now, and it’s a mistake to get caught up in a single report, or month, or even quarter’s worth of data. It’s much more important to take a step back and look at underlying trends and what they mean for the medium term. In this case, my forecast remains that we should reach our inflation goal around the end of the year.\n\nOn the other side of our mandate, I see very little slack left in the labor market.\n\nIn May, unemployment reached its lowest rate in 16 years, reaching 4.3 percent. I see it moving down even further — dropping as low as 4.2 percent by the end of next year. Upward pressure on wages is finally starting to assert itself, and I estimate wage growth of between 2.5 and 3 percent this year. This is a very good sign; it’s one of the things that’s been missing as the recovery has unfolded.\n\nJob creation is still strong. We had 138,000 jobs in May, which is a good number. I see job creation eventually falling to about 100,000 a month by the end of 2019.\n\nJust as I think we need to put monthly fluctuations in inflation data in perspective, I think we need to put job growth in context. In the very near future, we’re not going to need to create jobs at the intense pace we’ve been experiencing over the past few years.\n\nThe 100,000-jobs-a-month rate is going to be more than sufficient to keep up with population growth. That’s more or less the rate we’ll need in a normal, healthy economy.\n\nBased on the strength of the economy, I still see three rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017.\n\nI also believe that we will begin unwinding the balance sheet sometime this year, although I’m not tying that to a date on the calendar or a data point on an inflation report. It will be slow, steady, incredibly boring, and essentially on autopilot.\n\nAnd, of course, all of this is predicated on the assumption that things continue to unfold as they have been.\n\nThe Costs of Poverty and Inequality\n\nI say “based on the strength of the economy,” and I do believe that we are more or less at full health. The small adjustments that need to be made here and there are not earth-moving numbers, they’re just needed to ensure that the foundation is strong.\n\nBut that, of course, is the macro view. And that doesn’t take into account the places across the country, and within the Third District, that haven’t recovered the way their neighbors have.\n\nYou’ll hear a presentation later today that delves deeper into the state’s economy, and, of course, I’m speaking to the Pennsylvania Economic Association, so I’m sure you’re fully aware that there are pockets of the state that haven’t made their way back yet. You’re aware that Philadelphia is the poorest of the top 10 cities in the U.S. You’re aware that some of the cities and towns right next door are struggling economically.\n\nOne of the things the Fed does that doesn’t get much attention is our Community Development work. It’s almost our best-kept secret, which is too bad, because it’s incredibly important. I’d therefore like to talk a bit today about why that is and what we’re doing at the Philadelphia Fed to work with communities of all economic profiles across the Third District.\n\nFrom my personal perspective, there is an ethical obligation to do what we can to help each other. But Congress didn’t charge us with determining moral imperatives, which, obviously, rely much less on data than a wonky policymaker would be comfortable with.\n\nSo, I’ll stick to the pragmatic argument, which is that inclusive growth is good for the overall economy, and conversely, that both poverty and inequality in income are detrimental to the economic well-being of the country.\n\nThe current poverty line in the United States is an annual income of $24,339 for a family of four. According to the most recently available data, the U.S. has over 43 million people living in poverty. That’s over 13 percent of the population.1 As for inequality, the United States ranks 43rd in the world by the Gini index.2 There is growing debate within the field of economics on the impact of inequality. But while some inequality is inevitable in any free-market society, I’m in the camp that says too much inequality, or too much breadth in inequality, ultimately costs us.\n\nChildhood poverty alone costs the U.S. close to $500 billion annually.3 And research shows the effects of inequality on GDP is significant as well. For instance, when additional income goes to the top quintile of earners, GDP actually falls by 0.08 percent. But when the same happens for the bottom quintile, GDPrisesby almost 0.4 percent.4\n\nThen there is the simple fact that this vast and diverse country is made up of micro- and macroeconomies that are intertwined and overlap and have ripple effects beyond city, county, or state lines. Our economic fortunes are tied to one another.\n\nSo, if the problems facing some of us ultimately translate into the problems that face all of us, what do we do about it?\n\nEGMP: The Economic Growth & Mobility Project\n\nFor our part, the Philadelphia Fed has launched the Economic Growth & Mobility Project to look for practical applications for the abundance of research in the field. We have a lot of data and in-depth studies that can inform issues across the District and, hopefully, across the country as well.\n\nI’m a huge fan of research, as I’m sure everyone here is as well. It’s the fuel that keeps academics going. But there’s an added energy when our research has a practical application.\n\nThe work in the field of economic mobility has incredible potential, and we’re lucky enough to be sitting in the middle of a natural laboratory.\n\nI say it pretty frequently, but it bears repeating — while the Third District is the Fed’s smallest, it provides a unique perspective. It covers Pennsylvania from about Johnstown and east; southern New Jersey; and all of Delaware. Although it’s geographically very compact, the District encompasses urban centers, suburban expanse, post-industrial cities and towns, and rural areas.\n\nThat means it’s a microcosm of America. We know that the challenges that Philadelphia faces aren’t the same as the ones we find in Reading. The footprint of the Third District means we have the opportunity to find custom-fit solutions for both of those profiles and others as well.\n\nEGMP: Workforce Development\n\nOne of our primary areas of focus is skills training and workforce development. We’re starting to see a different set of issues emerge than we were contending with at the height of the recession, when unemployment peaked at 10 percent. Now we’ve got jobs going unfilled.\n\nThis isn’t just what I hear from my contacts in the community; it’s in the data. We’ve come to a point in the labor market where the competition is among the employers trying to fill slots rather than the applicants vying for them. But there’s a skills mismatch. There just aren’t enough people with the right training to do the jobs that are out there.\n\nI’ll give you an example: A contact of mine has a trucking repair business in Pennsylvania, and he’s doubled the number of bays because business is so good. But half of them are sitting empty because he can’t find qualified mechanics. He’s paying over $100,000 a year, but he just can’t find workers who are equipped to do the job. It’s no longer just mechanical; now that so much of truck repair is computerized, workers need digital skills as well.\n\nSo, what do we do? There is obviously a need for training programs and more investment in practical education. But there’s also a cultural shift that needs to happen. At some point along the way, we decided to burden vocational education with a negative connotation. We seem to have collectively decided that education should be one-size-fits-all. And I don’t understand that.\n\nNot everyone wants to take the road more traveled, and it’s not in everyone’s best interest to do so. There are good jobs out there that don’t insist on a traditional college plan.\n\nMy staff has done research on these in conjunction with the Cleveland and Atlanta Feds. They’re calling them “opportunity occupations”: jobs that pay at or above the median wage that don’t require a four-year degree. A lot of them are in health care, which is an industry with immense growth potential.\n\nIf we can be more strategic about the way we encourage and train our rising workforce, we can benefit both the workers and the employers.\n\nThere is one caveat that I should mention. Because, of course, there’s very little under the sun that is devoid of nuance or, frankly, potholes.\n\nIn follow-up research by my staff, they found that during the recession and slow recovery, the competition for jobs meant some employers began to upskill job requirements, even though it wasn’t strictly necessary. That is, for a job that had previously required an associate’s degree or technical training, they could now ask for a bachelor’s.\n\nThat has remained somewhat sticky as the labor market has tightened. But I believe that as time passes, we’ll start to see things come back into balance again. And I’d like to see that. Because the pathway to an economically secure middle-class life can and should be paved by different forms of education.\n\nAt the end of last year, I visited Roxborough High School in Philadelphia, which has an Academies program that allows students to pick a course of concentration while they study the regular curriculum.\n\nIt’s a pretty brilliant model because it sets them up to enter the workforce directly from high school if they want to, which means they can earn a good salary if they want to take a couple of years on the job before returning to school, work part-time while continuing their education, or just start their climb up the professional ladder immediately.\n\nI should mention that all of the students I talked to thought the practical aspect of their learning was a huge positive.\n\nSome of them get up at 5:00 a.m. and take three buses just to get to school because they see a place in this program as a stepping stone to a bright future. After high school, some of them may go the route of the traditional four-year degree, and some will do something different. One of the young women I spoke with wants to be an anesthesiologist, for instance, while another is thinking about a social media start-up.\n\nBut regardless of which track they choose, there’s no limit to their choices in life; none of them see their vocational training as anything but a competitive edge.\n\nThey’re right; after talking with them, I’m pretty sure at least a couple of them are going to be running the country soon enough.\n\nI really want their attitudes toward creative paths to education and training to be the prevailing ones: We all have our own ways of getting to the endpoint, and for the United States to have a labor market that is truly running on all cylinders, we need a workforce that is as innovative and creative as the sectors they represent.\n\nEGMP: Transportation\n\nOf course, no difficult problem or economic issue has one root cause; if it did, our job in Community Development would be much easier.\n\nIt’s clear that even if we arm people with the skills and training to get good jobs, it might not be enough. Because at the end of the day, not everyone can get to the good jobs.\n\nTransportation isn’t generally seen as an exciting topic, which is fine, because neither is monetary policy. But it’s an important one nonetheless. Some of the most intractable issues we face with social mobility are caught up in these kinds of basic infrastructure matters.\n\nThe ways we’ve migrated in this country, socially and economically, have changed over the decades and centuries. Where we once found the hubs of commerce, we also found residential areas.\n\nThen we began the immense wave of suburbanization that fundamentally changed the way we live and work and travel between the two.\n\nNow, we’re seeing the reversal of the trend that characterized the latter half of the 20th century and find people returning to city centers.\n\nWe have a transportation system, however, that was largely developed during the retreat from urban living and therefore built to bring people from the satellites into the center. But that’s not necessarily the best structure now.\n\nOur Community Development team has been working with the city of Scranton on exactly this issue. The Economic Growth & Mobility Project I mentioned is going to focus on action labs, which we’ll convene to find practical means to solving challenges identified by the communities we partner with. For instance, we’ve been working with stakeholders from across Scranton for the past several months to better understand their challenges in getting low-income residents connected to work and helping them identify solutions.\n\nOne of the biggest growth areas in the region is distribution centers, and there are a lot of jobs attached to them. But our transportation system is set up to bring people to the city center, not out to the areas where those distribution jobs are. The basic arithmetic is that, if you can’t get to a job, it doesn’t matter how many there are. And if you can’t fill the jobs, your business can’t expand.\n\nWe’re working with a local foundation to help bring people together to address Scranton’s specific needs. Then, hopefully, we can export that model and the lessons we learned to similar cities around the country.\n\nEGMP: Future Work\n\nThere’s a lot more in the pipeline and a world of work open to us. We have opportunities to partner with businesses, civic groups, not-for-profits, and philanthropies across the District and the country to find innovative solutions to problems in diverse areas.\n\nThe fact is that economic health is the sum of multiple parts, and investments in one area have huge implications for others. A better educated population, for instance, means a more skilled workforce pumping more money into the economy. More people employed in good jobs means lower crime and safer neighborhoods. Safer neighborhoods mean higher property values.\n\nThe work we do in Community Development to strengthen local economies will have effects that resonate beyond those areas, from Scranton to Reading to Wilmington and beyond.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]See Poverty Thresholds, U.S. Census Bureau, www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html; see Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015, U.S. Census Bureau, www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html.\n\n[2]See the World Factbook, Central Intelligence Agency, North America: United States, www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html.\n\n[3]Harry J.

        "content": "Good evening; it’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nTonight, I’d like to give you an overview of my outlook for the economy going forward, including my preferences for the path of monetary policy. Which, I assume, is what you’re expecting from me.\n\nI also assume you expect the standard disclaimer, which I’ll get out of the way immediately: The views I express here this evening are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nLet’s jump right in.\n\nStarting off, the advance estimate of first quarter GDP was that it grew only 0.7 percent. That’s prompted a lot of concern, which I think is an overreaction. It’s not a good idea to get caught up in a single data point, or report, or even a quarter’s numbers. It’s more important to look at underlying trends and what they say about the economy’s trajectory in the medium term.\n\nA slow first quarter isn’t something to ignore entirely, but weak first quarters have been a feature of the economy for the past several years. It’s essentially the norm now. Seasonality, weather, and low inventory investment were the main culprits this time, and those are likely transitory — they’ve been issues in the past, and they’ve retreated as the year wore on. So, it’s not enough to make me think that we’re headed in the wrong direction. It is enough to make me revise my growth projection down by 0.1 percentage point for the year, but that’s about the extent of it. Overall, that means I see growth of about 2.3 percent for 2017.\n\nTurning to the inflation side of our mandate, we’re still on track. While numbers have retreated slightly, again, I’m looking at the trend. A month or two in the wrong direction isn’t enough to make me lose faith.\n\nOn employment, things are looking very good. The unemployment rate has dropped to its lowest point in a decade, quits are up, and we’re starting to see upward pressure on wages. I estimate 2.5 to 3 percent wage growth this year, which is good. It’s what has been missing from this recovery.\n\nI expect the unemployment rate to continue to edge down, dropping as low as 4.2 percent around the end of next year. As for job creation, I estimate a rate of about 200,000 a month on average for 2017, falling to about 100,000 a month by the end of 2019.\n\nHere’s another point I want to make about headlines making more waves than they should. In the relatively near future, we’re not going to need the same pace of job creation as we did over the past several years. We had a lot of ground to make up for then, but we won’t need the same rate going forward. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 a month is what many believe is appropriate to keep up with population growth.1\n\nUltimately, we’re looking at a labor market with very little slack left.\n\nIn the near term, that means we should start to see movement on wage growth. In the medium term, it means we’re going to be seeing a more moderate pace of job creation. In the longer term … it means a serious talk about the labor market.\n\nLabor Force Participation\n\nThe labor force participation rate is still low. In the past couple of years, it’s moved roughly sideways, which was an upward surprise to some, given demographic motivators. And it was a downward surprise to others who speculated that more people would start to come back off the sidelines as the recovery continued.\n\nI’m in the camp that says we’re still projected to stay at a lower rate than previous years and that we won’t see a reversal in that trend going forward. Research by my staff is clear that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.2\n\nThe most influential impact is coming from the first wave of baby boomers starting to retire. There’s also the simple fact that we’re living longer, so there are just more people in the mix. Which I think is something to be celebrated, personally.\n\nThere are other contributing factors: students not working while they’re in school, for instance. A shift in views on work–life balance that has more people making the tradeoff of a single-income household. And then there’s the one that’s received the most attention: the declining participation of the prime age male cohort. There are a lot of theories and research on where they’ve gone. Alan Krueger’s much-talked-about recent paper found that close to half of the prime age men not in the labor force may have a serious health condition that keeps them from working.3\n\nThat said, there is some nuance to the prime age male conundrum. While the overall participation rate is low and there’s no evidence that it will surge upward, there is some room for prime age men’s participation to edge up a bit. The largest contributor to this group’s nonparticipation in recent years has been disability. Which theoretically should be long-lasting or permanent. But my staff’s research shows that at least some of that can be cyclical.\n\nThat, of course, will contribute marginally to the overall rate, although it won’t give us the boost we need to keep up with growth.\n\nIf we look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, we can already see some effects of low participation. After bottoming out in mid-2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the subsequent six years. That’s very slow for a recovery, and it’s even slow by historical averages. Growth averaged 3.5 percent in the second half of the 20th century — 1.7 percent of that came from the expansion of the American workforce. By contrast, the labor force has only grown by 0.5 percent over the recovery, less than half the historical average.\n\nThen there are the demographic shifts: The changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.4 Even though millennials outnumber us, they aren’t all fully in the workforce, and even the oldest ones aren’t quite in their prime earning years.\n\nWith all those people in retirement and with people living longer, there are more economic pressures to contend with. And the consequence of a declining participation rate means that output per capita will grow more slowly.\n\nWe therefore have a workforce that is less productive than it used to be with the pressure of caring for a retiring segment of the population that is bigger than it’s ever been before. There will be a strain on Medicare and Social Security, leaving fewer resources for the country to spend on other areas — for instance, maintaining our competitive global edge.\n\nMy remarks today will be heavy with caveats. The first being that as a Fed president, I’m not in the business of telling other people how to conduct their policy. So, the points I make today are from the perspective of someone who is affected — as a policymaker and a citizen — by the decisions made in legislative halls but not as someone who’s in a position to make those changes himself.\n\nMonetary policy is fairly limited in its scope. The Fed’s job is to create the conditions for a strong and healthy economy. Changing the trajectory of U.S. growth takes legislative action.\n\nThe fact is that this is basically it. This is the labor force we have. And if we expect our economy to expand, we need people to do the jobs we have now and the ones that are coming in the future.\n\nEmployers are struggling to fill the positions they have open. Even with workforce development and training programs, which are necessary, we just don’t have the people. We need to close the gap in the workforce. And given long-term demographic trends, that means we need to turn to outside sources.\n\nAgain, I want to be clear: I’m not suggesting immigration policy or telling anyone how to go about legislating. But from a purely economic standpoint, immigration, particularly high-skilled immigration, is a source of immense potential for economic growth. Fundamentally, we need more people; that’s how we get more growth.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nBut let me talk about the policy that is within my purview.\n\nFirst and foremost, based on the strong economic outlook, I continue to see three rate hikes for 2017 as appropriate. That, as ever, is assuming that things unfold in line with my projections.\n\nThen there’s the 800-pound gorilla in the room. Or, should I say, the $4.5 trillion gorilla in the room: the balance sheet.\n\nI know everyone here has the specifics down, but for the benefit of anyone who might not, and for posterity’s sake, a very quick primer on where we are and how we got here.\n\nIn normal times, the Fed holds mostly short-term treasuries. In extraordinary times, like in the recession and its aftermath, we’ve turned to unconventional policies, including QE. Which meant we were buying assets on a much larger scale and venturing into longer-term treasuries along with mortgage-backed securities. That swelled the balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, which is significantly larger than the $2 trillion it was when we started extraordinary monetary policy and the roughly $900 billion it was before the crisis.\n\nSince we stopped the purchases, in late 2014, we’ve simply reinvested the proceedings as they’ve come to maturity to keep the balance sheet constant. The discussion now is how and when to begin unwinding those assets, and, to some extent, why.\n\nThe why part is easy: As the economy continues its march toward normal, we’ll need to start removing accommodation. That’s a point I want to emphasize. Monetary policy has been very accommodative for almost nine years. As we start the process of normalization, it’s important to remember that tightening policy isn’t the same thing as tight policy. We’re talking about easing our foot off the proverbial gas — very slowly, I might add — we’re not talking about applying the brakes.\n\nWe will still be holding a lot of assets, we’ll still have rates that are historically very low, and the overall stance of monetary policy will still be very supportive of growth.\n\nThis is about recognizing that we’re headed toward an economy at full health and that means we start hovering over the punch bowl again, just in case we need to take it away. We don’t have our hands on it yet; we’re just edging toward it in case the economy starts to look like it’s overheating.\n\nAnother factor of the “why” is that we want our unconventional tools to be at their most effective. As productivity has dropped, it’s taken the neutral funds rate with it, which means the zero lower bound is closer and we have less room for maneuver. That constricts the efficacy of using the fed funds rate. And if something were to happen, if another crisis were to occur, further asset purchases may prove less effective, or perhaps even more difficult to execute, with a large balance sheet still in place.\n\nAs for the “when” part, I’m going to disappoint the journalists in the room by saying that the timing isn’t tied to a specific date or number. It’s the same discussion we had about when to start raising rates: We don’t want to get too far behind the curve on inflation and get forced into an abrupt or steep correction course that could cause market disruption. But we also don’t want to commit to a course of action if the data were to start moving in the wrong direction. I do think we’ll start sometime this year, but I’m not tying it to any numerical determinant, whether that’s a decimal point on inflation or a day in the calendar.\n\nThe “how” is predictable, slow, and as boring as possible. There are different options under discussion, but we’re looking for a normalization process that is gradual and essentially on autopilot. If something happens, of course we’ll intervene, but we fundamentally want to push the start button and leave it to churn slowly away. We’ll still discuss the balance sheet in meetings, but if things are good, we’ll leave it to gradually unwind in the background.\n\nAnd we’ll let you know. I can say with absolute certainty that markets will get a heads up with a good amount of time.\n\nI can also definitively say that it will be boring. It will be the policy equivalent of watching paint dry. Fed presidents had a brief encounter with people finding us interesting over the past few years. Now we’re headed back to the natural state of things, where people try to avoid getting stuck next to us at dinner parties.\n\nThe funds rate will be our primary monetary policy tool, and we’ll keep the unconventional ones in the arsenal in case we need to use them again, which I hope we won’t.\n\nSo, that’s it. I know I’ve probably disappointed some of you by not giving dates and times and the secrets of the chamber … although I’m sure you’re going to ask me in Q&A anyway. And with that, I’ll turn it over to you to do exactly that.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, Scott A.

        "content": "Good morning, and thank you. And congratulations! This is a wonderful day. You’ve accomplished so much, and your friends and families are so proud of you … give yourselves a round of applause.\n\nThat’s an old trick to make it look like you were giving me standing ovations from the beginning …\n\nSome of you are probably wondering why a Fed president is giving the commencement address to graduates in the field of health. The answer is that I can’t charge a speaker’s fee, so I’m cheap.\n\nI’m just kidding … or at least I think I am. President Klasko?\n\nBut in all seriousness, there is some method to the madness. For one, I can tell you that you’ve made an economically sound career choice. And you know it’s true because I’ve just established that they can’t pay me to say it. Also, the data back me up — health care is one of the fastest growing sectors out there, and it’s set to keep expanding for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo graduates, you have the security of entering a job market full of opportunities. Which means, parents, you have the security of knowing they won’t be moving back in with you.\n\nThere’s also an inextricable link between physical and economic well-being. In the research canon on creating economically strong communities, health is a critical factor. In fact, there’s a ton of research out there on how important health is to every aspect of life. It affects children’s prospects in education and achievement. It affects people’s ability to work and succeed in their careers. It affects entire neighborhoods’ economic potential. And it affects people’s ability to hope.\n\nYou’re graduating at a time when medicine is more advanced than ever before. But perhaps the most necessary and healing tool you possess predates Hippocrates. It’s the hope you give to people who are suffering. That’s both the power to heal and the ability to act as a touchstone.\n\nThere’s an energy that attaches itself to graduation season. Across the country, you and your peers are headed into a world of endless possibilities.\n\nIt’s an air of hope. Because hope, fundamentally, is the ability to see a bright future.\n\nIt can be easy to forget, on days like today, that there are pockets dotting the American landscape where hope is in short supply. You’re going to see it more than other people because you’re going to see the effects close up.\n\nYou’ll see it in the opioid epidemic. You’ll see it in what recent research calls “deaths of despair.” You’ll see it in communities that have struggled through years of neglect.\n\nThe effects are devastating, and they have a ripple effect across the entire health-care spectrum. Some of you will encounter it directly, some indirectly, but it’s likely it will touch you all professionally in some capacity.\n\nWhat strikes me is that the areas of the country that are struck low by the intersection of poor health and dim economic prospects, the areas that are most affected by these crises, are caught in a spiral of hopelessness. Your connections with people, the part you’ll play in giving them hope, can be life changing. In the words of Desmond Tutu: “Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness.”\n\nThat’s something to remember when you start your careers because the impact of working in health resonates far beyond treating a single malady. And it’s something to remember when you reach the midpoint, when you’re burned out from being down in the trenches, or when you start to question why you went into this field in the first place. Because believe me, there will be that time. Everyone has it.\n\nSo, when it happens, remember that you’re helping to heal people. You’re giving them back their hope, and that’s crucially important. And that goes for everyone here, whether it’s hands-on work with patients, research, or being part of managing the overall system.\n\nFrankly, anyone who helps to tame the bureaucracy of health care deserves a congressional medal of honor …\n\nSo today, in the commencement address tradition of dispensing advice, I’m not going to tell you to live every day like it’s your last. I’m not going to tell you to dream the impossible dream. I’m not going to tell you to change the world via disruption, although certainly feel free to do all those things. Instead, I’ll just tell you about the immense power of human interaction and that you can change the world one quiet, empathetic, kind moment at a time.\n\nKeep that with you. You bring hope. You are hope. Never forget that.\n\nAnd never forget that wherever we wind up, none of us got there alone. Whether it’s friends, families, partners, or even just those who let you borrow their notes when you overslept, someone helped you get here today.\n\nSo, I want to take a moment to applaud them, the people in the audience who helped today’s graduates get here, the people who aren’t here but made all the difference, the people who sat beside you in class, and the ones who stood up in front and taught. The ones who gave you hope! They all have a piece of the success and joy of this day.\n\nLet’s give them a round of applause.\n\nI’m a former university president, so I know the rundown of the commencement address pretty well by now, and I think I’ve more or less reached the end.\n\nRequisite joke about students moving back in with their parents? Check.\n\nAdvice from the old guy who’s been around a lot longer than the fresh young faces in the audience? Check.\n\nSelf-deprecating joke about being old? Check.\n\nThat means I’m up to the part where I leave you with a last thought.\n\nI’ve already done the part where I quote someone famous and far wiser than I am, but I’ll do it again and turn to someone who inspired me both personally and professionally: John Gardner, who was a great scholar and, among other things, initiated the White House fellows program that helped start me on my way. He said, “You find that the world loves talent but pays off on character.”\n\nYou’re about to enter a world that’s hard work but eminently worth it. The impact you’ll have on hundreds, even thousands, of people throughout your careers will be immense. You will touch people’s lives, you’ll make an incredible difference, and you’ll have the power to heal body, mind, and soul. You will change the world, one person at a time.\n\nThank you. And congratulations!\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

        "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nWhile I’m tempted to launch into the subject of the day immediately, Fed presidents are all but required to give an economic update when we speak. So, with your indulgence, I’ll start with a brief overview and outlook for the U.S. economy, and then speak a little about the importance of infrastructure to economic health.\n\nAnother requirement of Fed presidents is that we all give the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWith that out of the way, time for the economic rundown.\n\nOutlook\n\nThe advance estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter is 0.7 percent, which pales in comparison to the previous quarter’s 2.1 percent. But weak first quarters have been constant enough in the past several years to make them effectively the norm. This year’s slowdown was due — as in years past — to a combination of residual seasonality, weather effects, and modest inventory investment. These drags are likely temporary, and I expect a rebound in the second quarter.\n\nOverall, I see growth for 2017 at about 2.3 percent. That’s a very slight downward revision of my previous estimate — only 0.1 percentage point, which reflects that slow first quarter growth.\n\nOn the inflation side of our mandate, things are looking good. Inflation has been persistently low over the past several years, but it’s on track to stabilize at our 2 percent goal by the end of this year.\n\nOn the other side, we’re looking at the lowest unemployment rate in a decade. We created 211,000 jobs in April, and unemployment is at or below its natural rate at 4.4 percent. Quits are up, and labor force participation is higher than a year ago, despite demographic trends that are pulling in the other direction. All in all, we’re looking at a labor market more or less at full health, with very little slack.\n\nI see the unemployment rate falling as low as 4.2 percent at the end of next year and average job growth of about 200,000 a month for 2017. That pace should ease down to about 100,000 jobs a month by the end of 2019.\n\nThis isn’t a bad thing. In a well-functioning labor market, we don’t need the kind of job growth we’ve seen over the past couple of years. In fact, to sustain a healthy economy, estimates of the ideal number range from about 70,000 to 100,000 a month to keep up with population growth.1\n\nSo overall, things are looking good. We’re essentially at normal now, and based on the strength of the economy, I continue to see two more rate hikes as appropriate this year.\n\nEconomic Growth and Mobility\n\nOf course, that’s the macro view of the American economy. I’m not blind to the areas that haven’t made the same comebacks as their neighbors. I know there are people across our District who feel left behind. One of the benefits to the regional Fed System is that Fed presidents get an on-the-ground view of their local economies. Another is that we have programs to help those communities. We don’t invest money or give grants because that’s not what we’re tasked to do, but we do have education and outreach programs; we get the right people in a room together; and we conduct research — something we are, in my totally unbiased opinion, exceptionally good at.\n\nResearch matters. I know we sometimes seem like we’re all just fusty old academics, sitting around pondering the minutiae of data and maybe even missing the forest for the trees. But the work we do — everyone here — forms the basis of real, demonstrable change. It has the potential to move people and families and towns and cities along the path from poverty to prosperity, and that’s powerful. It also allows us to sit around being fusty academics, poring over the minutiae of data, but that’s beside the point.\n\nWe recently launched an Economic Growth & Mobility Project at the Philadelphia Fed that will take that work to its natural next step. We’re establishing research and action labs that will bring together experts and stakeholders to find ways to attack persistent problems at their roots. We’re looking at everything from workforce development — like apprenticeships and skills training — to work on the subject we’re here for today, urban infrastructure, including affordable housing and equitable transit.\n\nWhich is my awkward way of both plugging the excellent work by my Community Development team and pivoting to a new topic: infrastructure, the ebb and flow of urban patterns, and building inclusive economic growth.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nAs a Fed president, one of my aims is better economic prospects for the people in the Third District and around the country. One of the ways to accomplish that, of course, is urban revitalization — everything we’re talking about today: housing, transportation, competitiveness.\n\nInfrastructure is crucial. Humanity is naturally pulled toward what sustains us, be that practical or amenable. Real infrastructure is essential to modern living, whether that’s transportation or housing. So is soft infrastructure that promotes a better quality of life, from entertainment to quality and choice in education.\n\nAnd all of those are necessary for economic well-being, which I view as the sum of many parts, some of which sound tangential at best to a lot of people. Not anyone here, I’m sure, but to many. Affordable housing, strong education, transportation, and even physical health are all fundamental components of a thriving economy.\n\nIf people can’t afford to live near jobs — or if there’s no transportation to get them there — unemployment becomes a problem. If businesses can’t fill positions, they can’t expand.\n\nLikewise, the quality of life and ease of access in cities makes them competitive. High-value employees who can go anywhere are guided not just by salary but by amenities. That’s part of what compels businesses to establish a presence in one location over another. But if you can’t, for instance, fly internationally with ease, the city starts to look less desirable to a company that does business across the globe.\n\nSo yes, infrastructure of all kinds plays a central role in any city, region, state, or country’s success.\n\nInfrastructure and the Movement of People\n\nInfrastructure, both real and soft, has also played a role in where we live since we first built cities and towns across the colonies. Philadelphia itself is a perfect example.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, when we were a major trading center, not to mention the New World’s financial capital,2 everything was located by the river. On the commercial side, obviously anything related to shipping was drawn to the banks of the Delaware. But so were businesses that relied on trade, from tanneries to carriage shops to breweries.3 With that kind of concentration, it made sense for financial services to set up shop nearby.4\n\nTransportation options were limited, so most people lived within a few blocks of the river. Sure, the wealthy had country estates, but in the city, even they lived in the center of the action. Ultimately, people of all statuses lived in the central port area because of the concentration of industry and the high cost — and limited means — of travel.\n\nIn the 19th century, things started to change. New York usurped our role as the country’s financial capital, and manufacturing became Philadelphia’s economic engine. Factories were built farther west, toward Broad Street and Manayunk. Newer, faster modes of transportation were developed, and people started to live farther away from work, in the more comfortable — and quieter — suburbs.\n\nIn the 20th century, of course, the same kinds of forces affected migration. Transportation evolved even further, became even cheaper, and got people farther in less time. People owned cars, and we invested in the Interstate Highway System; research shows that highways caused a full 25 percent decline in central city living across the U.S. from 1950 to 1990.5 The suburbs offered more space and amenities at the same time that diminishing public financing and city services made urban Philadelphia less inviting.6 Manufacturing jobs also started to move out of the city.\n\nNow, of course, we’re witnessing the reversal of the mid-20th century suburbanization trend. This time, it’s partly motivated by the preference of higher-income households for conveniences like restaurants and theaters.7 Amenities have improved, and crime has gone down. As any Philadelphian can tell you, the city looks a lot different now than even 10 years ago, much less 20 or 30.\n\nSo, what does all this mean?\n\nFor one, it means that infrastructure plays a central role in where and how we choose to live.\n\nMore importantly, it means we have to think not just about how to equip our cities to handle the demands of a changing population but how to essentially reengineer the infrastructure that supported the needs of a different time. How, for instance, do we modernize commuter systems to serve changing commuting patterns?\n\nAnd finally, it means that we have to look more broadly at how regions — not just cities and states — work together to make systems more effective.\n\nBuilding an Inclusive Economy\n\nThe Third District is the smallest in the Fed System. We cover about two-thirds of Pennsylvania, starting around Johnstown and going east; Delaware; and southern New Jersey. But it’s really a microcosm of America: We have urban centers, suburban expanse, postindustrial towns, and rural areas.\n\nWhich means I can see the effect and influence of infrastructure on pretty much every economic profile.\n\nThere are three points I think are important when we talk about economic revitalization. First, that it should be inclusive. Second, that it can’t be one-size-fits-all. Third, that our neighbors’ fates are tied to our own.\n\nTaking those in turn:\n\nFirst, while economic strength and sustainability are important, we need to ensure they’re inclusive. That means balancing the risks of growth, particularly the displacement of a city’s long-term residents when good economic fortune sweeps in.\n\nWe’ve been watching and talking about gentrification for a long time. We know the patterns, and we know a lot about what drives movement into one neighborhood or another. With so many examples of booming cities across the country, cities should be able to plan ahead, whether that’s ensuring mixed-income housing or transit-oriented development.\n\nSecond, we have to acknowledge that the needs of Allentown aren’t the same as the needs of Philadelphia. My Community Development team is working with the city of Scranton on equitable transit, and we’ll have a summit in October to share some of the findings that can be adopted by other small cities around the country. Infrastructure — real and soft — is an issue for big cities, but it’s also important to smaller cities and towns, although they’re obviously addressing different concerns.\n\nFinally, as the president of a District that encompasses parts of three states, we have got to start seeing beyond traditional borders. I-95 doesn’t stop at the Philadelphia city limits. We’re a region as well as individual states and cities; working together on infrastructure projects is in everyone’s interest.\n\nConclusion\n\nI realize that I’ve made these proclamations as though fixes are easily found. As ever, just because we have the data or the experience doesn’t mean we have the solutions. If solving problems of economic expansion and sustainability were easy; if infrastructure came in an IKEA-like flat-pack, ready to be assembled; or if working across bureaucratic lines were simple, we’d have done it already. And a lot of economists would be out of jobs.\n\nIt takes work, I understand that. And much of that work has to be done outside the scope of my own professional reach.\n\nWhat we can do, however, is contribute to the body of research and offer ideas. That’s what we’re hoping to accomplish at the Philadelphia Fed, and that’s what conferences like this, and research like you’re undertaking, can help deliver as well.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]See, for example, Daniel Aaronson, Scott A.

        "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be back on Penn’s campus and an even bigger pleasure to return to my postgraduate days at the Engineering School.\n\nSo, why am I here? What’s a Fed president doing talking to a bunch of engineers? I suppose it’s all in the title of this lecture series: Technology, Business, and Government. There is so much overlap in that it makes sense to look at the ways they’re intertwined. It’s like a three-legged stool of modern commerce that you’ll all undoubtedly encounter in whatever profession you pursue. I started out as an engineer, so I suppose I’m living proof of that.\n\nI’ve actually found that some theoretical insights from systems engineering are easily applicable to commerce. So, the principles I learned right here come in handy, from complex adaptive systems to robust control to the Lucas critique. Although while engineers focus on the comfort of 95 percent accuracy, I’ve noticed that economics earns the term “the dismal science.” Central bankers focus on that errant 5 percent and seem to always be looking for black swans.\n\nSince I’ve mentioned my colleagues, now’s a good time to deliver the standard Fed disclaimer that I’m speaking for myself today and my views do not necessarily represent those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nSo, today I’d like to briefly outline what it is I do, give a quick economic update and outlook, and then talk about an area of increasing discussion these days: fintech. This is something that touches all three legs of the stool — technology, business, and government — and is an area some of you might find yourselves working in or alongside.\n\nFederal Reserve Overview\n\nBefore I start, just a very brief overview of the Federal Reserve System for the uninitiated. The Fed is set up in a uniquely American way: It’s a decentralized central bank. We have 12 regional Banks around the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. We vote on policy roughly every six weeks, which now mostly consists of decisions on whether or not to raise interest rates.\n\nWe make monetary policy, which shouldn’t be confused with fiscal or other policy. We focus on a dual mandate given to us by Congress, which is maximum employment and price stability. We don’t make decisions about things like debts and deficits, spending, and entitlements.\n\nIn general, you don’t hear too much about us unless we’ve done something, so you probably know that we raised rates at this last FOMC meeting. It was only the third time we’ve done that since we lowered them to near zero more than eight years ago, so it attracted some attention.\n\nEconomic Outlook\n\nFrom my perspective, it made sense given the data we’ve seen.\n\nThe labor market has shown steady improvement, and the 4.7 percent unemployment rate is at, or near, what I consider to be the natural rate of unemployment. We created 235,000 jobs in February, and we’re averaging about 200,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months.\n\nWage growth has ticked up, which is something I’ve been looking for. Average hourly earnings increased 2.8 percent over the past 12 months.\n\nJob openings remain high, layoffs remain at almost historical lows, and more people are quitting their jobs. This is one of those quirky measures we focus on. It’s a good indication of how people view the economy: They’re more likely to quit when they have confidence they can find a new job quickly.\n\nOn the inflation side of things, the momentum continues to be in the right direction. Inflation has been persistently below our target rate of 2 percent, but it’s been moving slowly but surely upward. We’re on the right track to reach our goal by the end of this year or the beginning of next, in my estimation. Recently, GDP (gross domestic product) growth has been driven largely by consumption, and I continue to forecast just above 2 percent growth for the year.\n\nI’m on record as saying that I view three rate hikes as appropriate in 2017, assuming things stay on track, and I still think that’s the right call. I continue to believe they should be gradual, both in pace and increments. I don’t want to get behind the curve, but I don’t think we need to rush, either. I consider every meeting to be live and that gives us plenty of opportunity over the course of the rest of the year.\n\nWe say all the time that our decisions are data dependent. So, I’ll be looking at the information as it comes in, but right now that’s the trajectory I see for policy.\n\nFintech: The Technology Leg\n\nSo, what does all this have to do with fintech? The obvious answer is that we deal with the banking system. The other is that we deal with money. And a big area of interest for a lot of people is digital currency. What impact might digital currency have? And how do I, as a monetary policymaker, view it in the context of my responsibilities? Before I get into that, I want to take a step back and first consider what, exactly, currency is and how — or rather, why — it works.\n\nThe underpinning of currency, like the financial system itself, is trust. A fiat currency like that in the United States, which is issued by a central bank in a secure and stable economy, works because we trust it. A dollar is a dollar. We all agree that it is and there’s not much that can undermine that faith. We experience inflation, sure, but not often in dramatic or abrupt ways.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the things you’ll see with digital currency is how wildly the value swings. The question is will there ever be a digital currency that is stable enough to become as widely used as a government one.\n\nResearch by my staff indicates that privately issued currencies can lead to unstable money supply and depreciation of the currency. Why? Because there’s no fundamental guarantee of its value in the same way that there is with currency issued by the central bank of a credible and stable government.1 So, unless a government issues it, the answer is likely that no, digital currencies won’t drive out our own any time soon. And while some governments are exploring the possibility of producing their own digital currencies, several hurdles remain, as my colleague, Governor Powell, outlined recently. Those include technical challenges, the unprecedented risk of cyberattacks, potential for criminal activity like money laundering, and threats to privacy.2\n\nThen there’s blockchain. Blockchain has tremendous potential and banks can use it to further manage risk. From my perspective, however, its real value is in authentication, not on distributing a virtual currency. And the implications of having a distributed ledger that offers virtually failsafe data storage are huge on the risk management side for any business.\n\nSo, there’s definitely some very interesting and potentially game-changing innovation coming out of fintech. But fintech overall is actually just natural market evolution and the assumptions about disruption — or indeed, creative destruction — are, with apologies to Schumpeter, probably out of proportion.\n\nPart of the reason things can look like a revolution instead of an evolution is that we’re viewing them in isolation. If you look along the broad history of an industry, you put things into context. You see the way banking evolved its products and appendages just like the first single-cell organisms evolved fins and gills and eventually feet and legs. Securitization, credit scoring, prepaid cards — which my team had already done about 20 studies on before anyone was paying much attention to them — don’t look revolutionary on the scale of fintech. But neither does the Commodore 64 when you stand it next to a MacBook Air. Yet we’d never overlook the effect of widely available in-home computers.\n\nSo, while much of this is exciting and the technology is very, very cool, I always warn against overstating its overall effect. This is, by and large, the same kind of evolution the banking system has seen for the past 40 years; it’s just a different delivery system.\n\nMy favorite analogy is peer-to-peer lending. When I was growing up in New Jersey, we had the same thing. Only in our case, Frankie asked Jimmy at the local bar to loan him a 20. The big difference was Jimmy knew where Frankie lived, so there was a lower rate of default. But overall, we’re talking about the same concept; we’ve just applied new technology to it.\n\nIn fact, what underpins the Frankie and Jimmy scenario, and banking and lending in general, is the fundamental principle of trust. In the grand scheme of things, as innovations enter and leave markets, the ones that survive — in any good business, but especially banking — are the ones that engender trust.\n\nWe trust that the cash we take out of an ATM is U.S. currency that has an agreed-upon value. We trust that when we want to access our bank accounts, the funds will be available. We trust that when we access credit that the terms and conditions we agree to will be followed by both parties.\n\nFintech may be a major player, but people have to be able to put their trust in it, and it has to prove its value to markets and the consumer.\n\nWe’re hosting a conference in September that’s going to focus on exactly that subject: What’s the end result in the efficient functioning of markets and in benefits to the consumer? What’s the benefit in consumer surplus that any of these innovations creates?\n\nMore research from my Bank indicates in its initial findings that for the same risk of default, consumers pay smaller spreads on loans from fintech companies than from traditional lenders. That’s something that can add value to a lot of people.3 The question of trust and value, of course, is a basic business principle.\n\nFintech: The Business Leg\n\nWhich leads me to the next leg of the stool: What do these developments mean for business? If fintech is wildly successful, if we all abandon tellers and ATMs, are banks going away?\n\nPolicymakers don’t like to make predictions, because the future has a funny way of defying expectations. But in this instance, I’ll go out on a limb and say no. Banks aren’t going anywhere.\n\nIt’s true that out of every innovation, a little disintermediation must fall. And sure, some roles and functions will be made obsolete. But that happens with all progress. The changes in the banking system over the past 40 years have continually pushed some players out at the same time that it’s steadily brought others in.\n\nWith banks, I think it’s more a case of the real estate agent than the travel agent. Here’s the analogy: With the advent of e-commerce, both the travel and housing markets were affected. But only one of them saw the demise of one set of intermediaries. Travel agents largely disappeared because we all know what we want out of a flight, a hotel, or a vacation. It’s something we do often enough and are familiar enough with to trust our own instincts. The risks are small. Buying a plane ticket isn’t inexpensive, but it’s a low-risk proposition in the grand scheme of things. And the value that travel agents brought can be largely replaced by our own Internet research. In this case, the web did replace the travel agent as our intermediary.\n\nWe still have real estate agents, however, even though I can get a 360-degree view of a house that’s five states away from the comfort of my living room. Why? Because real estate agents still add value. They perform a fundamental service that we can’t provide ourselves and can’t be found online — at least not as well. People don’t buy houses that often. I personally don’t want to take on the risk of doing it all myself. I want a professional who knows what papers to file, what zoning laws have to be followed, what surveys should be done, and what market expectations are. Even though the technology has evolved, we still need those intermediaries.\n\nLikewise, no matter what happens in the world of fintech, you still need a trusted broker of money. The roles may change and adapt, but someone needs to be the source of funds and credit.\n\nThere’s always going to be a place for maturity transformation, for instance. When people make longer-term loans, it creates a maturity mismatch on the balance sheet of the lender. This is because the liability side of the balance sheet can evaporate much more rapidly than the asset side, making the lender either illiquid or insolvent.\n\nOne of the key economic contributions of banks is that they manage that risk. A fintech firm is unlikely to have that scope and long-term trust, at least not for a while. Similarly, you and I wouldn’t make good credit card lenders, even if we had the right coding and software. So, those won’t completely disappear, either.\n\nThere will be some disintermediation, but that’s been the case in banking since deregulation started in the 1980s. At the end of the day, we still rely on those institutions to manage risk and provide a safe haven.\n\nThis is where I return to the core principle: The benefit a business or technology creates for markets and the consumer. Banks know they have to focus on the functions that add value. It’s easy for a well-capitalized bank to fund a start-up, let it take the risks, and then adopt the successful technology. Fintech may fully permeate the banking industry, but it will likely be in a way that sees many of the old players adapting new technologies rather than being put out of business by them.\n\nFintech: The Government Leg\n\nThat relates directly to the government part because a large portion of government’s role in fintech will be regulation. Regulators have to think about how to create oversight that doesn’t stifle innovation while simultaneously protecting markets and consumers. The fintech industry has to think about what regulation means for them.\n\nI want to say here that regulation isn’t a bad thing. It’s necessary for a functioning system, and it’s one of the ways to confer the trust that is so essential. And in the case of fintech, it’s in fintech firms’ best interest to know what’s expected from them from the beginning. Otherwise, they may have to play catch-up or retrofit their business model to comply with oversight that comes later. Not to mention, building the trust in the system that regulation can offer makes their businesses more resilient.\n\nMost fintech firms are relatively new. They haven’t been through the downside of a credit cycle. And the unfortunate reality of modernity is that there will be a down cycle. For those companies that are getting to a scale where negative events could have a major impact on their business, regulation is especially important because it acts as a safety net.\n\nMore important, regulation that comes in after a crisis almost always fights the last war. That kind of oversight is generally more restrictive and would likely put far more burden on fintech firms than starting out sooner.\n\nI want regulation that safeguards the consumer, the market, and the emerging fintech industry itself. I like innovation; I like responsible innovation more.\n\nConclusion\n\nThat’s about the long and the short of it. Fintech touches many sectors and it offers some exciting ways to modernize the banking industry. It’s not a radical departure in the sense that the industry has been evolving over the past several decades, but it’s new and interesting in the sense of the technology it offers. I hope the value is equal to the technology, and I think it will be. Because that’s the story at the end. At the end of the day, it’s about efficient market function and protecting the consumer.\n\nThank you.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Daniel Sanches, “On the Inherent Instability of Private Money,” Review of Economic Dynamics, 20 (2016), pp. 198–214.\n\n[2]Jerome Powell, “Innovation, Technology, and the Payments System,” speech given at Blockchain: The Future of Finance and Capital Markets?

        "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here, and I want to thank everyone for coming, even those of you who are just trying to get out of class.\n\nToday I’d like to talk about the economy as a whole, which I’m sure you expect of a Fed president. But I’d like to start with a refresher course on the Fed and what it is we do as well as a sort of monetary policy 101. That’s not to assume no one knows what we do, although I’m often surprised at cocktail parties to hear how much power people think I have. I can’t single-handedly move markets, although it’s flattering people think so.\n\nIt’s more to reset the wider conversation about where the U.S. economy is today, what challenges we’re facing, and what can be done to really change its course. And, frankly, since I have a captive audience, I’m not missing an opportunity to talk to the next generation of potential Fed employees.\n\nBefore I begin, the first rule of the Fed club is: Don’t talk about the Fed club until you’ve delivered the standard disclaimer — the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed: Overview\n\nFirst, the very basic overview. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks across the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. I’m president of the Philadelphia Fed, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. Each of the regional Banks is an independent entity, and we represent our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate monetary policy.\n\nWe do that roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meetings. That’s where we vote on monetary policy, which is now mostly about moving interest rates.\n\nThe governors always have a vote as does the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate onto voting positions. I’m voting this year for the first time. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence.\n\nWhen we’re not in a voting position, we’re still part of the conversation. One of the benefits of the System is that we get to be the voices for the people in our regions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a dual mandate outlined by Congress: price stability and maximum employment. We also regulate banks, process payments, and conduct economic research.\n\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work in our communities to help strengthen local economies. We have an exceptional team in Philadelphia, and I’m not just saying that because they make me look good. We recently had Chair Yellen come with us to visit the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which connects unemployed people in the area with employers. The Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development team works with organizations to promote stronger economies through everything from skills training to research on economic mobility. And they connect people and issues to the resources they need.\n\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a lot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In Philadelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\n\nSo, that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy: The Basics\n\nThat said, monetary policy is still the big one. And that’s where I come — if you’ll indulge me — to my second primer of the day: monetary policy 101.\n\nMonetary policy is not the all-powerful tool it’s often portrayed as. It’s relatively limited in its scope, and it’s a relatively blunt instrument. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\n\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance. But the majority of it is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\n\nFiscal and other policy areas are where you’ll find the decisions that really affect things like growth. The Fed creates the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. We till the land and make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the crops — are decisions beyond our control, which brings me to where we stand now in our role and our decisions.\n\nThe economy, overall, is in pretty good shape. After eight-plus long years of recovery, the economy is more or less back to full health.\n\nWe added 227,000 jobs in January, continuing a steady pace of employment. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, at or below my estimate of the natural rate.\n\nI want to say here that when Fed policymakers talk about employment, we’re doing it at a national level. I’m not blind to the realities on the ground, particularly in my own District. There are pockets here and around the country that have been left out of the rebound. There are demographics that have been persistently cut out of that good labor-market fortune. The unemployment rate for African American men, for example, was 8 percent in January.\n\nWe make policy at a national level, so we look at national averages. But we understand that there are areas that still need particular focus. It’s part of the reason we, as presidents, make sure we feed back the realities on the ground in our Districts. Some of the issues we can help address through our community development work, but most of it is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nAs for inflation, that’s been a little more stubborn, but we’re on track there as well. The myth about inflation is that the Fed is only concerned about it when it gets too high. In truth, we have a goal of 2 percent, and we worry about deviation in either direction. I don’t mean we run around with our hair on fire if it’s a little higher or a little lower once in a while. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nIt surprises some people that the issue with inflation over the past few years is that it’s been too low. That sounds odd to a lot of people, especially those of us who lived through the high inflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The students in the audience definitely won’t remember that, and I think some of the faculty might even be too young.\n\nIn any event, we’re starting to see upward movement on our goal, and I see inflation rising to meet our target sometime late this year or early next, which means that we’re essentially at our goal.\n\nOur job now is to maintain the land and keep conditions right for economic growth.\n\nFor our part, that’s about how we manage interest rates. I see three hikes as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe growth part, however, is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nSo, what really does move the economy?\n\nAnd what problems are we actually facing?\n\nI think it’s safe to say there are a lot of opinions about both of those. And I hear most of them. Whether I like it or not …\n\nSo, I’d like to cut through the noise.\n\nWith employment generally at our goal and inflation on track to meet it, the issue now is growth.\n\nFrom an economic modeling standpoint, growth right now is more or less what we should consider normal. My forecast for 2017 is a touch above 2 percent.\n\nIf we want to move that needle, we need to address the underlying factors that are keeping it at its current rate.\n\nGrowth is fundamentally productivity plus growth of the labor force, and therein lie two of the bigger problems facing the American economy.\n\nProductivity\n\nI’ll start with productivity. Productivity has been falling lately — not just in the U.S., incidentally, but globally. And to some extent, the reasons are a mystery.\n\nThere is one school of thought, popularized by the economist Robert Gordon, that productivity has been spurred throughout history by big, game-changing inventions. Think steam engine, electricity, the Internet. And that the only way we will see productivity on par with past surges is if some revolutionary new invention again changes the way we do business. Well, wait a minute. Doesn’t the vast world of Internet-enabled work count? In this theory, not really. The explanation would be that in the first tech revolution, most of the innovation went to making businesses work more efficiently, letting them produce more with less. In this iteration, the majority of the disruption has been in areas of leisure rather than business. Some might even argue that the availability of such personal distractions has caused us to be less productive because we’re more distracted.\n\nThis might sound terrifying because what else is there to invent? But in this view of the world, all isn’t lost because we never really know when the next big revolution is around the corner.\n\nI’m not personally dedicated to this theory. I think there are ways to increase productivity. But it’s been a potent and interesting point of discussion.\n\nThe other question most often posed is whether we’re measuring productivity correctly. With all the web-based business out there, is it even possible to measure output? Aren’t we assessing productivity on an outdated scale?\n\nThe first thing I’ll say is that productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. And the economy may be changing in ways that make it even harder. We have the best minds available working on this, but they fully admit it’s difficult to keep up. For example, how do we include smartphone apps that are downloadable for free in measures of output? Research at our Bank suggests that, even if we correct for this, it would only make a small difference in the rate of output growth. So, our best guess remains that productivity has slowed, while at the same time, there is widespread agreement that output and productivity are likely somewhat greater than we think. Welcome to the dismal science.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nThe second factor in the growth equation is the labor force.\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk lately about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate. There is some thought that it might be significantly higher than the official numbers say.\n\nTo dig into this, I should outline a few measures of how we gauge the health of the labor market.\n\nSome of it is what you hear frequently: U3 unemployment. You’re all econ and finance majors, so you know that’s the basic measure of the unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. You’re unemployed if you’re looking for a job. If you’ve just graduated and you’re on your first search, you’re part of that number. If you’re looking for work after some time off, you’re part of it, too. If you’ve retired, if you’re not working by choice, if you’re taking a break, you’re not considered unemployed. U3, as I said, is currently 4.8 percent.\n\nYou also know that the U6 measure is more involved. For the uninitiated, that one takes U3 and adds people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time, and people who say they’d like a job but stopped looking. U6 currently stands at 9.4 percent.\n\nWe also look at how many people are quitting their jobs, which reflects how confident they are that they’ll find another. We look at how many net new jobs were created. We look at what we hear from businesses about how hard it is to fill positions, and a host of other information.\n\nThen there is the labor force participation rate. This is where things get sticky.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a measure of what proportion of the working-age population is either employed or looking for a job. It’s easy to look at this and draw some unsettling conclusions, especially when I tell you that the labor force participation rate is currently 62.9 percent.\n\nThis is the number that alarms some people, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.\n\nFirst of all, we define the working-age population as everyone over the age of 16. So, that means your kid brother who’s a junior in high school and my 92-year-old mother are both counted. Second of all, we’re dealing with a different population than we have in the past. The baby boomers represent the biggest generation in history to start moving into retirement, and we’re living longer in general. I’m pretty pleased about the last one, frankly. Ultimately, the pool of people not seeking employment for very good reasons is much larger, skewing the overall number.\n\nSo, in the sense that low labor force participation points to an unemployment rate that is radically higher than official numbers suggest, that’s not really the case.\n\nIt is, however, a problem. Just for different reasons.\n\nThe participation rate has been declining in recent years. There are a few factors that influence that. For one, people are staying in school longer, and many younger people aren’t working while they’re there. For another, some people have decided that they’re happy with a one-income household, often reflecting preferences of work–life balance.\n\nThe third, as I mentioned, is that the baby boomers are heading into retirement. This is the big one.\n\nI say this is the big one because research by my staff shows that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\n\nAnd since the vast majority of the decline comes from the onset of the baby boomers’ retirement, they don’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate will drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.2\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nIt’s a big deal because participation affects growth. As an example, if you look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, you’ll see that after the bottom out in 2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the next six years. That’s not just slow for a recovery; it’s slow by historical averages. In comparison, in the second half of the 20th century, growth averaged 3.5 percent. A full 1.7 percent of that came just from the expansion of the American workforce. Over the course of the recovery, by contrast, the labor force has grown by an average of about 0.5 percent. That’s less than half the historical average.\n\nWe also have to think about the economic pressures that demographics put on us as a country. With an unprecedented wave of Americans heading into retirement and living longer to boot, we’re talking about a lot of resources. Social Security, Medicare, living expenses in general. While the millennial generation is slightly larger than the boomers, they’re not yet fully in the workforce, and even the oldest of them still aren’t in their prime earning years.\n\nThe changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.3\n\nDeclining participation equals shrinking output. That is, with fewer workers, the U.S. will produce less. When we produce less, growth stalls. Ultimately, successful and healthy economies have high participation rates.\n\nPolicy Possibilities\n\nNow that I’ve scared the daylights out of everyone, can anything be done?\n\nAgain, the solutions to these problems lie in areas outside monetary policy. Since I know how it feels to have someone else comment on the job you’re doing, let me be clear that I’m not telling elected officials what to do. I’m just a policy wonk with too much data on my hands, and I follow the numbers.\n\nSo, please take this next part as simply the analysis of an impartial, data-driven party.\n\nAs pertains to productivity and growth overall, investment in human and physical capital are vital; that is, education, science, health, and the infrastructure of our cities and towns. These help create a strong and diversified workforce and will help America keep its edge as a leader in innovation across sectors.\n\nOne of the areas we’ve focused on at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to education and professional readiness.\n\nThe data show that there’s a skills gap. There are jobs out there that can’t be filled because people just don’t have the right training. That’s the big problem in many industries: They can’t fill jobs because not enough people are trained to do them.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make post-secondary education one-size-fits-all when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\n\nOn the participation side of things, we can only grow as fast as our workforce can take on the work. Right now, we just don’t have the people, unless we want my mother and her friends to come out of retirement. But I’m pretty sure we’d have a fight on our hands …\n\nWe need more bodies in the workforce. How and whether we make the decision to do something about it is again out of my hands. And I don’t want to wade into turbulent political waters. But the bottom line is that we don’t have enough people, and pulling talent in from outside the United States is one way to solve the problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is and has been an economic powerhouse for most of the past century. We’re the world’s largest economy, and we have consistently been a source of innovation and invention. If we want to keep our global edge, it’s time to think about broad policies that look to where we’ll be in the future. When I was playing football, we ran where the ball was headed to catch it; that’s how we have to look at policy — monetary, fiscal, and other — not where we are on the field but where we’re headed.\n\nWith that, I’m happy to turn the floor over to some questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Research Rap Special Report, February 2014.\n\n[2]Fujita.\n\n[3]James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, 89:1, February 2007, pp. 100–109.",

        "content": "Good afternoon and thank you. It’s always a pleasure to be back home at Wharton.\n\nToday I’ll give a brief overview of the economy, my outlook for the next year or so — including the path of monetary policy — and then talk a little bit about a subject that’s probably near and dear to a lot of your hearts: student debt.\n\nBefore I begin, I’ll start the way I always do with the standard proviso that my views today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of others in the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nLabor market\n\nWith that out of the way, things are looking pretty good.\n\nWe started off the year with a strong labor market. We added 227,000 jobs in January, and the unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, which is at or below my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. That’s a slight uptick from December, but it reflects more people coming off the sidelines and back into the labor force. So in this case, it’s a positive outcome.\n\nU6 unemployment is 9.4 percent. While that’s still higher than I’d like, it’s a far cry from the bad old days of the recession and its aftermath when U6 reached a peak of about 17 percent.\n\nQuits are still high, layoffs remain low, and job postings are near historical peaks. My business contacts continue to tell me that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting more and more difficult.\n\nTaking that all into account, the labor market continues to tighten. And I see it as more or less back to full health.\n\nWhenever I talk about the labor market, I’m always careful to point out that just because things are good — or even healthy — doesn’t mean they’re perfect. There continue to be pockets in the country — both geographically and demographically — that aren’t feeling the relief. We have a lot of them in the Fed’s Third District: post-industrial towns, rural areas, and the urban landscape. Philadelphia is the poorest of the 10 biggest cities in America, and Camden has, at various times, been called the poorest city in America period. Among different segments of the population, the unemployment rate for African American men remains at 8.0 percent, significantly higher than the national average.\n\nWe need to pay special attention to the regions and demographic groups that have been left behind. The Fed can help to some extent through our community development work, which focuses on strengthening local economies. But for the most part, monetary policy doesn’t have the scope or tools to address these issues head on. That takes legislative action.\n\nAnd while I’m relatively upbeat about employment, there’s still room for wage growth to move up. While the continued improvement in the labor market has moved the needle on wage growth — as of January, the year-over-year growth was about 2.5 percent — previous expansions have seen sustained growth of above 3 percent. That’s what we expect in a robust economy.\n\nInflation\n\nMoving on to inflation, we’re seeing positive upward movement, although PCE remains below our 2 percent target. Headline and core PCE closed out last year at 1.6 and 1.7 percent, respectively. That’s a world of improvement over the end of 2015, when they were at 0.6 and 1.4 percent.\n\nWe do have January numbers for CPI inflation, with headline CPI rising a remarkable 0.6 percent, driven largely by an increase in gas prices. That brings the year-over-year change to 2.5 percent. Core CPI rose 0.3 percent, bringing that year-over-year change to above 2 percent.\n\nI should note that inflation as measured by CPI is often higher than PCE. That said, it still indicates an overall upward movement, and I see us reaching our 2 percent target on PCE sometime this year or next.\n\nAnother positive indicator is that we’re starting to see inflation expectations rally around the 2 percent goal.\n\nGrowth\n\nTurning to growth, real GDP increased 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. A substantial drag from net exports slowed growth there. While real GDP growth was stronger in the second half of 2016 — after it grew by 3.5 percent in the third quarter — we’re really looking at moderate growth overall, averaging just under 2 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters points to 2.2 percent growth in the current quarter.\n\nRetail sales have been strong, rising 0.4 percent in January. In fact, we’ve seen a rapid acceleration in retail sales since the middle of last year. And consumer confidence has continued the upward trend it started in 2016, carrying into this year.\n\nOverall, I see strong consumer spending driving growth of about 2 percent over the course of the year. And that 2 percent growth is more or less what we should consider normal for the medium term.\n\nMonetary policy\n\nSo, what does all this mean for monetary policy? Given the state of the economy — more or less back to normal — I continue to see three modest rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track.\n\nI’ve said it before and I don’t mind repeating myself: Monetary policy is a fairly limited tool that is fairly limited in its scope. A lot of people would like to see growth above our 2 percent projection, but that’s not really up to Fed officials. That’s the kind of policy that’s outside our purview.\n\nIf we really want to move the needle, we need to invest in physical and human capital.\n\nStudent loans\n\nAnd that’s where I come to the subject of student loans.\n\nI should mention that different Federal Reserve Banks have different areas of research focus. Dallas, as you might imagine, spends a lot of time looking at energy markets. In Philadelphia, we’re the System leaders in research on consumer credit and finance. So, we have a lot of expertise in this area.\n\nThere’s no question that investing in the education of our citizens is essential for growth and is the core of our economic future. We’re talking about the engine of the American economy: The men and women who will be creating the next miracle drug, inventing the next radical technological innovation, writing the next wave of legislation.\n\nBut there’s an all-too-familiar problem that can act as a barrier to people getting the education they need.\n\nTo steal a line from John Oliver, if you went to college in America, chances are you have two things: Bob Marley’s greatest hits and student debt.\n\nThe headlines you’ve heard before, and they’re fairly staggering:\n\nThe number of people with student debt doubled between 2000 and 2014, for a total of about 42 million. Aggregate student loan debt in the U.S. is currently nearly $1.3 trillion.1\n\nThe average student loan borrower has about $31,000 in outstanding balances, whereas the typical American borrower owes over $16,000.2\n\nAnd 11 percent of balances are past due, compared with 8 percent 10 years ago. It should be noted, however, that the delinquencies have been coming down since the peak of 12 percent in 2012.3\n\nThat’s the data we’re used to hearing, and that’s what most of the conversation is about, for good reason.\n\nBut there are more data and some nuances to the numbers that bear investigating. Because if we’re going to reach policy conclusions — and for the record, I’m not going to reach any policy conclusions because that’s not my job — we should dig a little deeper.\n\nFirst and foremost, defaults on smaller loans are actually more common than on big ones.\n\nThere are a number of factors that play into this, but there are some trends that emerge.\n\nLarger loans tend be taken on by people attending four-year institutions, and those students tend to complete school at a higher rate. They may have more debt when they graduate, but graduating makes them more likely to find a job and a better paying one at that. So, those students tend to be in a better position to repay loans.\n\nStudents at for-profit colleges or two-year programs are generally in school for shorter periods of time, which is part of the reason the amounts are smaller. However, a significant portion of these students are unlikely to finish their degree or certificate. And people who don’t complete their programs are more likely to default.\n\nThis is largely because they struggle to find jobs that pay enough to both repay loans and cover the general cost of living. That was made exponentially worse by the recession and the attendant weak labor market.\n\nIn 2013, for instance, the unemployment rate for borrowers who were recent graduates of four-year, public, and nonprofit institutions was 7.7 — only a little higher than the overall average unemployment rate for that year.\n\nBy contrast, recent graduates of two-year colleges had an unemployment rate of 16.9 percent. More alarmingly, those who went to for-profit schools had an unemployment rate of 20.6 percent.4 To put that in perspective, we would literally have to go back to the Great Depression to get a national level of unemployment that high.\n\nThe recession was also marked by a dramatic increase in attendance at two-year and for-profit colleges. These schools accounted for roughly half of the increase in student debt between 2009 and 2011. This increase was part of a longer-term trend that highlights a lot of the data I’ve just talked about. From 2003 to 2013, over 30 percent of the increase in student debt was taken on by students from those institutions.5\n\nWhat does this tell us, and why does this matter?\n\nI’m not ignoring the issues facing students who graduated on time from four-year institutions and found good jobs when they left. Being in a better state than their counterparts doesn’t lessen the blow of a few decades of paying off loans. And it still has implications for the broader economy: Millennials are now technically a larger generation than the baby boomers, and owing money affects the way they live and participate in the economy. There’s a good amount of research that links student debt to younger adults being unable to move out on their own. Some of it finds a big enough effect to impact the housing market.\n\nBut we should also look at the way the segmentation of the student debt market impacts the way we view the issue, and, more broadly, how we approach policy.\n\nFundamentally, this is a question of how we look at skills, the labor force, and the ways in which we prepare people for professional success.\n\nI’m always careful to avoid wading into debates about how elected officials should make policy. There are larger questions about the allocation of funds at the local, state, and federal levels that I’m going to sidestep.\n\nWhat I can address is some of the data and research.\n\nI’m frequently amazed at the simplicity of programs that have demonstrable effects. Case in point, there is evidence to suggest that by simply offering high school students more intensive, personalized information about college options, they make better, more successful choices.6\n\nLikewise, a more flexible approach to repayment can keep people from winding up in a debt cycle that can permanently affect their credit.\n\nAt the moment, student debt holders have the option of programs that protect them from spending more than 10 percent of their income on repayment. But they have to reapply annually, filling out the kind of complex sets of forms that bureaucracy is famous for. And eligibility is based on the previous year’s income, which means if you lose your job, you won’t be off the hook for payments for quite a while. The complexity — and probably the frustration — of the process keeps a lot of people out of the process who could use the help.7\n\nOne possible solution can be found in our counterparts overseas. Repayments are automatically linked to income through the tax systems in countries like Australia, the UK, New Zealand, and others. In addition to the relief it gives people paying off student loans, it reduces the dreaded reams of paperwork.\n\nAnother issue altogether is thinking about how we address tertiary education on a societal level. When my parents were growing up, all you needed for a good job was a high school diploma. That was still true for some of my generation, but that necessity quickly turned to being a college degree. I bet a lot of you and your friends feel that you won’t be competitive in the marketplace without a master’s.\n\nThe thing is we don’t all need or want the same educational track. A traditional four-year degree is great for some people. Ditto a post-graduate degree.\n\nFor others, it’s not necessarily the right path. And we should stop making people feel as though they all need to fit into the same mold.\n\nOne of our research areas at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to education and professional readiness.\n\nThe data show a skills gap. I hear it all the time from my business contacts: They have the jobs — they just don’t have the people to fill them because they don’t have the right training.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce.\n\nI saw this in action when I visited the Academies at Roxborough High School with my Community Development staff. This is a program that trains high school students to be career ready when they graduate, so they can make the move into jobs that will pay them a good wage. Some of them will go on to traditional four-year programs, some will get further technical or vocational training, some will start their career path right out of the gate. But they’ll all have the opportunity to make a living while they’re pursuing either more education or moving along their professional pathway or both.\n\nIf we approach education and the needs of the workforce from a different angle, we can save a lot of the heaviest-hit students a world of debt hurt.\n\nConclusion\n\nI can’t formulate education policy, or allocate funds, or even make my own children study what I want them to — although, of course, I’m immensely proud of them and they’ve made excellent choices without listening to me.\n\nBut I can point to the research and what the data say. Changing our approach to how we invest in education and training won’t take care of the entire student debt issue, but it can help those who are disproportionately affected by it.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]FRBNY Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, November 2016.

        "content": "Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here, and I want to thank everyone for coming, even those of you who are just trying to get out of class.\n\nToday I’d like to talk about the economy as a whole, which I’m sure you expect of a Fed president. But I’d like to start out with a refresher course on the Fed and what it is we do as well as a sort of monetary policy 101. That’s not to assume no one knows what we do, although I’m often surprised at cocktail parties to hear how much power people think I have. I can’t single-handedly move markets, although it’s flattering people think so. It’s more to reset the wider conversation about where the U.S. economy is today, what challenges we’re facing, and what can be done to really change its course. And, frankly, with so many La Salle students in the audience, I’m not missing an opportunity to talk to the next generation of potential Fed employees.\n\nBefore I begin, the first rule of the Fed club is: Don’t talk about the Fed club until you’ve delivered the standard disclaimer: The views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Fed: Overview\n\nFirst, the very basic overview. The Federal Reserve System is made up of 12 regional Banks across the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. I’m president of the Philadelphia Fed, which covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. Each of the regional Banks is an independent entity, and we represent our Districts when we meet in D.C. to formulate monetary policy.\n\nWe do that roughly every six weeks at the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, meetings. That’s where we vote on monetary policy, which is now mostly about moving interest rates.\n\nThe governors always have a vote as does the president of the New York Fed. The rest of us rotate on to voting positions. I’m voting this year for the first time. I’ve noticed people care a lot more about what I have to say recently, which I’m sure is just a coincidence.\n\nWhen we’re not in a voting position, we’re still part of the conversation. One of the benefits of the System is that we get to be the voices for the people in our regions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has two responsibilities outlined by Congress, what’s referred to as our dual mandate. Those are price stability and maximum employment. In their very simplest terms — with apologies to any economists in the room who hate it when we put things in their simplest terms — that’s first, low and stable inflation. And second, that — for the most part — if you’re looking for a job, you can find one. That isn’t a guarantee for every single person or that the job you get is the one you want; it’s a cold and analytical assessment of the overall state of the labor market in a massive economy.\n\nThe Fed also regulates banks, processes payments, and conducts economic research.\n\nAnd — the part that never gets enough attention, in my opinion — we do research and work in our communities to help strengthen local economies. We have an exceptional team in Philadelphia, and I’m not just saying that because they make me look good. We recently had Chair Yellen come with us to visit the West Philadelphia Skills Initiative, which connects unemployed people in the area with employers. The Philadelphia Fed’s Community Development team works with organizations to promote stronger economies through everything from skills training to research on economic mobility. And they connect people and issues to the resources they need.\n\nDifferent Banks also sometimes specialize in particular research areas. Obviously, Dallas does a lot on energy markets. New York has a special focus on international financial markets. In Philadelphia, our area of expertise is consumer credit: cards, household debt, student loans, etc.\n\nSo, that’s the Fed overview. We do a lot of things other than monetary policy.\n\nMonetary Policy: The Basics\n\nThat said, monetary policy is still the big one. And that’s where I come — if you’ll indulge me — to my second primer of the day: monetary policy 101.\n\nMonetary policy is not the all-powerful tool it’s often portrayed as. It’s relatively limited in its scope, and it’s a relatively blunt instrument. In normal times, monetary policy is mostly raising and lowering interest rates — or keeping them the same.\n\nIn extraordinary times, we may use tools like quantitative easing or forward guidance, which is just policy speak for telling people what to expect.\n\nHowever, the majority of what we do is the somewhat boring business of keeping rates at a level that encourages a healthy economy and helps us meet our dual mandate.\n\nThe policy decisions that affect things like debts and deficits, taxes and spending, are made by elected officials. Those are fiscal policy.\n\nFiscal and other policy areas are where you find the decisions that really affect things like growth. The Fed creates the conditions in which a healthy economy can thrive. We till the land and make the soil fertile, if you will. But the actual thriving part — planting the seeds and tending the crops — are decisions beyond our control, which brings me to where we stand now in our role and our decisions.\n\nThe economy, overall, is in pretty good shape. After eight-plus long years of recovery, the economy is more or less back to full health.\n\nWe added 227,000 jobs in January, continuing a steady pace of employment. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, at or below what economists term the “natural rate” of unemployment. That’s the rate we can expect in a healthy economy.\n\nI want to say here that when Fed policymakers talk about employment, we’re doing it at a national level. I’m not blind to the realities on the ground, particularly in my own District. There are pockets here and around the country that have been left out of the rebound. There are demographics that have been persistently cut out of that good labor-market fortune: The unemployment rate for African American men, for example, was 8.0 percent in January.\n\nWe make policy at a national level, so we look at national averages. But we understand that there are areas that still need particular focus; it’s part of the reason we, as presidents, make sure we feed back the realities on the ground in our Districts. Some of the issues we can help address through our community development work, but most of it is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nAs for inflation, that’s been a little more stubborn, but we’re on track there as well. The myth about inflation is that the Fed is only concerned about it when it gets too high. In truth, we have a goal of 2 percent, and we worry about deviation in either direction. I don’t mean we run around with our hair on fire if it’s a little higher or a little lower once in a while. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nIt surprises some people that the issue with inflation over the past few years is that it’s been too low. That sounds odd to a lot of people, especially those of us who lived through the high inflation of the late ’70s and early ’80s. The students in the audience definitely won’t remember that, and I think some of the faculty might even be too young.\n\nIn any event, we’re starting to see upward movement on our goal, and I see inflation rising to meet our target sometime late this year or next, which means that we’re essentially at our goal.\n\nOur job now is to maintain the land and keep conditions right for economic growth.\n\nFor our part, that’s about how we manage interest rates. I see three hikes as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe growth part, however, is up to fiscal and other policy.\n\nSo, what really does move the economy?\n\nAnd what problems are we actually facing?\n\nI think it’s safe to say there are a lot of opinions about both of those. And I hear most of them. Whether I like it or not …\n\nSo, I’d like to cut through the noise.\n\nWith employment generally at our goal and inflation on track to meet it, the issue now is growth.\n\nFrom an economic modeling standpoint, growth right now is more or less what we should consider normal. My forecast for 2017 is a touch above 2 percent.\n\nIf we want to move that needle, we need to address the underlying factors that are keeping it at its current rate.\n\nGrowth is fundamentally productivity plus growth of the labor force, and therein lie two of the bigger problems facing the American economy.\n\nProductivity\n\nI’ll start with productivity. Productivity is defined as output per unit of input. Basically, how much cost and effort it takes to produce a single unit of a good.\n\nProductivity has been falling lately — not just in the U.S., incidentally, but globally. And to some extent, the reasons are a mystery.\n\nThere is one school of thought, popularized by the economist Robert Gordon, that productivity has been spurred throughout history by big, game-changing inventions. Think steam engine, electricity, the Internet. And that the only way we will see productivity on par with past surges is if some revolutionary new invention again changes the way we do business. Well, wait a minute. Doesn’t the vast world of Internet-enabled work count? In this theory, not really. The explanation would be that in the first tech revolution, most of the innovation went into making businesses work more efficiently, letting them produce more with less. In this iteration, the majority of the disruption has been in areas of leisure rather than business. Some might even argue that the availability of such personal distractions has caused us to be less productive because we’re more distracted.\n\nThis might sound terrifying because what else is there to invent? But in this view of the world, all isn’t lost because we never really know when the next big revolution is around the corner.\n\nI’m not personally dedicated to this theory. I think there are ways to increase productivity. But it’s been a potent and interesting point of discussion.\n\nThe other question most often posed is whether we’re measuring productivity correctly. With all the web-based business out there, is it even possible to measure output? Aren’t we assessing productivity on an outdated scale?\n\nThe first thing I’ll say is that productivity is notoriously difficult to measure. And the economy may be changing in ways that make it even harder. We have the best minds available working on this, but they fully admit it’s difficult to keep up. For example, how do we include smartphone apps that are downloadable for free in measures of output? Research at our Bank suggests that, even if we correct for this, it would only make a small difference in the rate of output growth. So, our best guess remains that productivity has slowed, while at the same time, there is widespread agreement that output and productivity are likely somewhat greater than we think. Welcome to the dismal science.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nThe second factor in the growth equation is the labor force.\n\nYou’ve probably heard a lot of talk lately about the “real” or “hidden” unemployment rate. There is some thought that it might be significantly higher than the official numbers say.\n\nTo dig into this, I should outline a few measures of how we gauge the health of the labor market.\n\nSome of it is what you hear frequently: the unemployment rate. That number is actually what we call U3 unemployment. That’s the basic measure of the unemployed as a percentage of the labor force. You’re unemployed if you’re looking for a job; if you’ve just graduated and you’re on your first search, you’re part of that number. If you’re looking for work after some time off, you’re part of it, too. If you’ve retired, if you’re not working by choice, if you’re taking a break, you’re not considered unemployed. U3, as I said, is currently 4.8 percent.\n\nThe U6 measure is more involved. That one takes U3 and adds people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time and people who say they’d like a job but stopped looking. U6 currently stands at 9.4 percent.\n\nWe also look at how many people are quitting their jobs, which reflects how confident they are that they’ll find another. We look at how many net new jobs were created. We look at what we hear from businesses about how hard it is to fill positions, and a host of other information.\n\nThen there is the labor force participation rate. This is where things get sticky.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a measure of what proportion of the working-age population is either employed or looking for a job. It’s easy to look at this and draw some unsettling conclusions, especially when I tell you that the labor force participation rate is currently 62.9 percent.\n\nThis is the number that alarms some people. But there’s more to it than meets the eye.\n\nFirst of all, we define the working-age population as everyone over the age of 16. So, that means your kid brother who’s a junior in high school and my 92-year-old mother are both counted. Second of all, we’re dealing with a different population than we have in the past. The baby boomers represent the biggest generation in history to start moving into retirement, and we’re living longer in general. I’m pretty pleased about the last one, frankly. Ultimately, the pool of people not seeking employment for very good reasons is much larger, skewing the overall number.\n\nSo, in the sense that low labor force participation points to an unemployment rate that is radically higher than official numbers suggest, that’s not really the case.\n\nIt is, however, a problem, just for different reasons.\n\nThe participation rate has been declining in recent years. There are a few factors that influence that. For one, people are staying in school longer and many younger people aren’t working while they’re there. For another, some people have decided that they’re happy with a one-income household, often reflecting preferences of work–life balance.\n\nThe third — and this is the big one — is, as I mentioned, that the baby boomers are heading into retirement.\n\nI say this is the big one because research by my staff shows that the fall in the labor force participation rate is mostly due to demographic factors.1\n\nAnd because the vast majority of the decline comes from the onset of the baby boomers’ retirement, they don’t think the trend will reverse. In fact, they project that the participation rate will drop a further 2 percentage points over the next five years.2\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nIt’s a big deal because participation affects growth. As an example: If you look at the U.S. economy during the recovery, you’ll see that after the bottom out in 2009, real GDP grew at an average of about 2 percent for the next six years. That’s not just slow for a recovery; it’s slow by historical averages. In comparison, in the second half of the 20th century, growth averaged 3.5 percent. A full 1.7 percent of that came just from the expansion of the American workforce. Over the course of the recovery, by contrast, the labor force has grown by an average of about 0.5 percent. That’s less than half the historical average.\n\nWe also have to think about the economic pressures that demographics put on us as a country. With an unprecedented wave of Americans heading into retirement and living longer to boot, we’re talking about a lot of resources: Social Security, Medicare, living expenses in general. While the millennial generation is slightly larger than the boomers, they’re not yet fully in the workforce, and even the oldest of them still aren’t in their prime earning years.\n\nThe changes to the American labor force in age, in educational attainment, and in expertise in certain sectors are actually harming productivity. In general, productivity is higher in midcareer workers, and their proportion of the U.S. labor market is smaller than it was during the height of the baby boom’s working years.3\n\nDeclining participation equals shrinking output. That is, with fewer workers, the U.S. will produce less. When we produce less, growth stalls. Ultimately, successful and healthy economies have high participation rates.\n\nPolicy Possibilities\n\nNow that I’ve scared the daylights out of everyone, can anything be done?\n\nAgain, the solutions to these problems lie in areas outside monetary policy. Since I know how it feels to have someone else comment on the job you’re doing, let me be clear that I’m not telling elected officials what to do. I’m just a policy wonk with too much data on my hands, and I follow the numbers.\n\nSo, please take this next part as simply the analysis of an impartial, data-driven party.\n\nAs pertains to productivity and growth overall, investment in human and physical capital are vital; that is, education, science, health, and the infrastructure of our cities and towns. These help create a strong and diversified workforce and will help America keep its edge as a leader in innovation across sectors.\n\nOne of the areas we’ve focused on at the Philadelphia Fed is skills training and alternative routes to education and professional readiness.\n\nThe data show that there’s a skills gap. That is, there are jobs out there that can’t be filled because people just don’t have the right training. That’s the big problem in many industries: there are jobs but not enough people who can do them.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nIf we reconsider the way we train people, especially for occupations that require special skills, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make post-secondary education one-size-fits-all when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\n\nOn the participation side of things, we can only grow as fast as our workforce can take on the work. Right now, we just don’t have the people, unless we want my mother and her friends to come out of retirement. But I’m pretty sure we’d have a fight on our hands …\n\nWe need more bodies in the workforce. How and whether we make the decision to do something about it is again out of my hands. And I don’t want to wade into turbulent political waters. But the bottom line is that we don’t have enough people, and pulling talent in from outside the United States is one way to solve the problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe United States is and has been an economic powerhouse for most of the past century. We’re the world’s largest economy, and we have consistently been a source of innovation and invention. If we want to keep our global edge, it’s time to think about broad policies that look to where we’ll be in the future. When I was playing football, we ran where the ball was headed to catch it; that’s how we have to look at policy — monetary, fiscal, and other — not where we are on the field but where we’re headed.\n\nI hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time, and I’m happy to turn the floor over to some questions.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014).\n\n[2]See Fujita.\n\n[3]James Feyrer, “Demographics and Productivity,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 89(1), pp. 100–109 (February 2007).",

        "content": "Introduction\n\nGood afternoon and thank you. I’d like to start by saying that I’m a proud and loyal son of the Federal Reserve System’s Third District, which encompasses the eastern portion of Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. I’m proud of the people, the places, and our contributions. With that said, thank you for getting me out of that weather and inviting me to San Diego.\n\nWe’re here today to discuss “payment systems in the Internet age,” a subject that could occupy a full month’s conference and that brings up interesting complexities for anyone interested or invested in the subject.\n\nIt is also something of a complex topic for someone involved in regulation, so I should note from the outset that the views I express today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nWith that out of the way, I’d like to talk today about how fintech has evolved and the role it plays in the overall financial system. That involves going back to first principles, because whenever we’re dealing with emerging areas of regulation, it’s important to address what that oversight is and isn’t addressing.\n\nThe Evolution of Fintech\n\nThose of us who’ve been watching the evolution of what we now call fintech can probably agree that it existed before the headlines it’s garnered over the past five or six years. That, in fact, they reflect changes that have been in motion since the ’90s and early 2000s.\n\nI don’t want to diminish the inventive spirit evinced by the tech sector. But it’s important to remember that the application of technology to financial institutions and functions has been going on for some time. We sometimes forget, with the incredible innovation coming out of Silicon Valley — and Silicon Alley, and Silicon Beach, and all the other hubs this country has produced — that the tech revolution is advancing into middle age, which is only to say that we’ve been watching the disruption of various sectors — even ones as staid and resistant to change as financial services — for a while now.\n\nWe’ve gone from hardware-oriented to software-oriented innovation, and IT has become much more sensitive and responsive. Internet capabilities have advanced by leaps and bounds just in the past decade, changing the game for front-end functions. This makes it possible for startups to reach consumers in a way that only banks could do 25 years ago. In many instances, this has inverted the relationship between consumers and service providers and banks.\n\nSo, if you ask anyone who’s old enough to have witnessed the industry evolve since that time — a time when many of the people creating today’s software were just being born — you’ll hear that major change has come but also that, in some ways, everything old is new again. We’re just finding new platforms.\n\nTake peer-to-peer lending, an area that’s captured particular attention. Lenders and lendees are connected in ways they haven’t been before, and there’s a spirit of inclusion and a feeling of active participation, which is wonderful. But even that movement is essentially adding a technological edge to something we’ve been doing since humankind embarked on a system of goods and trade in kind. In my day, it happened over beers at the corner bar, when Eddie asked Joey to loan him a 20. Peer-to-peer lending has been going on since time immemorial. What makes fintech different is that the scope of its ability to match people with one another is infinitely broader.\n\nDefining Fintech\n\nWhich brings me to what, exactly, we mean by fintech. While it doesn’t have a fully accepted definition, I think we can all agree that fintech is more or less the application of technology to the financial services sector.\n\nIt may seem odd to define it, but there is honestly some confusion. And with so many firms calling themselves fintech, it’s good to lay down a baseline. So, for the purposes of our discussion today, I’ll be talking about fintech firms as those that apply technological innovation to financial functions and systems.\n\nBanking and Financial Systems: First Principles\n\nAlso for the purposes of our discussion today, I am going to get even more basic and establish what those systems are, why they exist, and what underpins them.\n\nThe evolution of financial systems and intermediation has been studied and commented upon for centuries. It evoked renewed interest after the global crisis as people began to reexamine the purpose of markets and the role of the financial system.\n\nWhile there is a lot to dissect with regard to the various innovations of financial vehicles and the ways in which institutions are structured, a financial system is fundamental to the human experience as we know it.\n\nThese systems evolved because humanity is driven to find comforts beyond subsistence-level living. We can’t buy food or shelter in the modern age without a system of payments, finance, and credit. And our incorporation of a financial system has existed in some form for most of our history. Whether it was trading or banking, societies across the globe have operated on the premise of: You have something I want or need, and I will give you something in exchange. From the central agora to apps on our phones, whether it’s a creditor’s note or a series of 1s and 0s, the essentials of the system have stood the test of time.\n\nAt its most basic, the financial system exists to keep savings safe; to ensure that people and businesses can easily price, buy, and sell things; and to make certain that we can all use our financial resources to their best advantage, whether that means paying for food and housing, getting an education, expanding businesses, or investing our assets.\n\nThis is critical for all of us because a strong and sound economy can only exist when it’s underpinned by a strong and sound financial system.\n\nAnd what underpins a strong and sound financial system is trust.\n\nAdam Smith said, “All money is a matter of belief,” and it naturally follows that all financial systems are a matter of trust. A financial system can only exist if we collectively agree to it. A system of savings, credit, exchange, and investment survives because we have faith in people we don’t know, currency we have no individual control over, payment systems with inner workings we don’t see, and institutions we grant power to — both to house and to regulate those systems.\n\nWhy do I mention these? Because they are central to the next steps for fintech.\n\nFintech: What’s Next\n\nWhile I noted that fintech is just the latest iteration of changes we’ve been seeing for a few decades now, it is still new from a regulatory standpoint, and it’s likely heading into uncharted territory. It’s unlikely that increased oversight will be welcomed with open arms, but I should say now that it’s actually in the interest of fintech firms.\n\nIn part because they exist in a business environment that is much more Silicon Valley than Wall Street, fintech firms, by and large, do not see themselves as banks. But many of them are, ultimately, financial institutions.\n\nBanks, by definition, are institutions that take deposits and make loans. While many fintech organizations see themselves as mere facilitators, if they are providing the essential functions of a banking institution, that poses questions about regulation. And if they’re subject to oversight, it’s better for them to understand what it takes to be compliant from the beginning.\n\n“Regulation” being the great bogeyman of the industry, I’d like to note that regulation is necessary for a functioning system. The trust that underpins the financial system is either earned or guaranteed by people or institutions. One of the ways of conferring that trust is the promise that mechanisms are in place to safeguard the system.\n\nFintech firms need that trust the same as any other bank or financial institution. This underlying expectation is why it’s best to get in early on regulation. It’s in these firms’ self-interest to provide a layer of trust-building that regulation can offer, particularly those that are getting to a scale where negative events could have major consequences.\n\nThis is especially true because most fintech firms today haven’t yet seen the down side of a credit cycle, and trust then will be shaken.\n\nAny student of economic history has to acknowledge that, like death and taxes, a down side to the cycle is inevitable. The aftermath of the cycle’s end will determine a lot of the character and contour of what sort of company can survive in this space. That alone should be cause for fintech to want some form of oversight.\n\nWhat fintech outfits don’t want is regulation that comes in after a crisis. That type of regulation almost always fights the last war, and that could mean tighter strictures and less room for innovation after the crash at the end of a credit cycle. Policymakers have too much experience with the old adage that history may not always repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\n\nSo, I think there are two things to focus on when talking about regulation: First, that it’s structured to protect both institutions and the public. Second, that we consider what regulation already looks like and where we think it’s headed.\n\nRegulation\n\nI have to stress that as a Federal Reserve Bank president, I have no hand in drafting regulations. So, forgive me if I veer into armchair quarterbacking.\n\nWhat I am able to do is talk more broadly about what’s been proposed, the examples we have to look at in other countries and regions, and what I think is likely to occur.\n\nThe European Union has given us some comparison for the proposed measures from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which remains the most comprehensive attempt at mapping out a strategy in the U.S. to date. In particular, a lot of commentary in the payments industry has drawn parallels between the European Commission’s Payment Services Directives and the OCC’s proposal to grant national bank charters to fintech companies.\n\nFintech firms vary widely in their business models: While some provide payments-related services, others offer loans to consumers and businesses, provide digital currencies, or offer financial planning or wealth management services.\n\nFor fintech firms whose business falls more on the payments end, there is some comparison to the European model. The Commission’s Directives ask that these types of firms be licensed and satisfy other general requirements. The closest analogy we have in the U.S. is state regulation and supervision of money-service businesses. Some fintech firms that fall under this umbrella are unhappy with the idea of having to obtain many, if not dozens, of licenses to operate around the country. The proposed OCC charter may offer them some relief.\n\nOn the other side, to the extent that the fintech firm is weighted toward making loans — especially to consumers — the Payment Services Directives don’t quite correlate. For that, the better comparison is the Commission’s Task Force on Financial Technology, which makes policy recommendations on fintech in financial services. It formally incorporates viewpoints from multiple regulatory bodies, not just banking regulators, which sets the European model apart from the OCC’s suggested framework.\n\nThere is an open question about whether or who should supervise fintech lenders in the United States, made all the more complicated by the interplay between our state and federal regulatory frameworks. Most personal finance companies, for example, are licensed and regulated at the state level. Uncertainty about the boundaries between these two competing spheres of authority can be seen in some states’ reactions to the OCC’s proposal.\n\nBut, particularly if we’re talking about loans to consumers, it’s only a matter of time until federal consumer protections will come into play.\n\nAll of which is to say, it’s complicated. But it continues to be, in my opinion, in the interest of fintech companies to be regulated.\n\nThis may sound like the particular nannying of a sometime regulator asking for more oversight. I’m not speculating at all that the Fed will be involved in fintech regulation. But I can say that none of us are trying to stifle innovation. If anything, you’ll hear us praise the ingenuity and imagination that comes from the technology sector. But there are risks, and we should be talking about them. Regulation can’t solve everything, and it can’t anticipate or guard against every problem. But it can try.\n\nFor me, regulation is not just a question of protecting consumers; it’s a question of protecting the innovators as well. It’s in their best interest to have an established framework in which to operate. In part because the trust it engenders will underpin their essential role in the financial system.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgain, this all comes back to trust and its critical role in the financial and economic systems. Whether it’s Eddie borrowing a 20 off of Joey at the corner bar, or the loan officer at our local community bank, we trust people to act in accordance with an agreed-upon code, both the legal one enshrined in legislation and the moral one we’ve entered into as a society. Whether it’s a structurally important financial institution or an app on our phone, we trust institutions to hold up their end of the bargain we struck when we deposited or borrowed funds. And whether it’s administered by multiple agencies or a single body, at the state or federal level, we trust that there is a safeguard in place to guide and protect the companies we’re entrusting with our economic livelihoods.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.",

        "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning. It’s a pleasure to be in New Jersey.\n\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economy, talk about the implications for monetary policy, and explore some of the issues affecting the region, particularly workforce development.\n\nBefore I start, however, I should add the usual disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nWith that out of the way, the headline is that things are looking pretty good. Or, as I should say as a policy wonk, “The economy is displaying considerable strength.” GDP continued to grow in the third quarter at an even faster pace than in Q2. Third-quarter growth was recently revised up to 3.5 percent. That was driven largely by consumption.\n\nConsumer confidence is strong, retail sales are still solid — though slightly slower than previously anticipated — and equity markets are up.\n\nThe new orders index, though positive, fell slightly in December, though the regional business activity index increased sharply.\n\nAll in all, the snapshot is of a robust American economy.\n\nInflation\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In its simplest terms, that means that most people can find a job if they’re looking and inflation stays low and stable.\n\nStarting with inflation, we aim for an average of 2 percent. A little higher or a little lower from time to time is not something to worry about. We don’t need to be exactly at 2 percent all the time. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nPeople sometimes assume that the Fed worries more about inflation being too high than too low. But we give equal weight to distance from our goal, regardless of the direction. Over the past few years, inflation has been below target. That’s the main reason interest rates have been so low for so long. We’re starting to see some upward movement in the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE: It has increased to 1.7 percent, near our target.\n\nI know the joke is that Fed policymakers must not eat or drive because we prefer the core measure. But we’re looking for underlying trends, and stripping out those volatile components gives us a better read. That said, the yearly growth in the headline PCE index has also increased, rising to 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 0.3 percent a year earlier.\n\nAdditionally, inflation expectations are starting to rally around the 2 percent goal. One important facet of economics is that expectations can play a role in outcomes, particularly in inflation. It’s something of a monetary self-fulfilling prophecy. If markets believe inflation will remain low, it’s more likely to do so. And over the past few years, not everyone was on the same page with their predictions. But as expectations consolidate around our target rate, it makes it more likely that our target will become reality.\n\nLooking at all the information and the trends over the past few years, I see inflation on course to meet our target sometime this year or next.\n\nLabor Market\n\nOn the employment side of things, we’re doing very well. We had another month of solid gains in December, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs. That’s an average of 165,000 over the last quarter of 2016.\n\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent, which is at, or below what most economists believe is its natural rate of about 5 percent. The natural rate is the rate that we expect in a healthy economy.\n\nOf course, we don’t just look at the headline unemployment rate. And it should be noted that joblessness hits some portions of the population harder than others. For instance, the unemployment rate for African-American men was 8.6 percent in December, almost four percentage points higher than the average for the entire adult population.\n\nThere’s also a lot of talk about hidden pockets of unemployment, with particular concern that people may have dropped out of the labor market entirely, out of frustration. But even U6 unemployment has declined to 9.2 percent. While that’s still higher than headline unemployment, it’s worth noting that U6 peaked at about 17 percent during the worst of the recession and its aftermath.\n\nDemand for labor also remains strong and more people are quitting their jobs. That’s good news for the economy — it shows workers are more confident they can find another one — though I suppose some overworked HR managers might not be 100 percent thrilled about it.\n\nLayoffs also remain at all-time lows and job postings are near historical peaks. We continue to hear from our business contacts that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting progressively more difficult.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, it’s safe to call the U.S. labor market more or less at full health.\n\nOf course, that’s the economy as a whole. Things aren’t evenly distributed across this huge and diverse country. In New Jersey, unemployment is still slightly above the national average, at 5.0 percent. Job growth is lagging the country as a whole on an annualized basis, with New Jersey seeing 0.3 percent compared with the nation’s 1.7 percent. Labor force participation — which I’ll discuss in more detail in a moment — dropped steadily from April of 2016 to its current reading of 63.6 percent. That’s the lowest reading since 1983.\n\nOverall, New Jersey faces different issues than other states. The concentration of workers in uncompetitive industries has had a hand in slow job growth,1 and the large foreclosure inventory is restraining the housing market. The share of active loans in foreclosure is roughly three times larger than the country as a whole. We’ve made significant progress since 2013, but the share is still above prerecession readings, and we are faced with the simple math that when you’re hit harder, you have more ground to make up, and it takes longer to recover. House prices in New Jersey are growing below 3 percent, while the national average is 6. Add in the state budgetary pressures and the recent downgrade of the state credit rating, and the concerns of the people in this room look entirely different than those of other states’ bankers associations.\n\nThings are getting better, particularly in the past few months, but I point out the disparities between regions for two reasons.\n\nOne is that I get to praise the structure of the Federal Reserve System. I think it’s uniquely American to have a decentralized central bank — to have a structure that makes policy for a huge and incredibly varied economy, but takes into account the differences between regions. We know that the economic fortunes of Camden don’t look like those of Seattle. And when the FOMC comes together, the presidents of the 12 banks get to be a voice for their communities and businesses.\n\nI also mention it because I’m interested to hear your take on the employment situation in the area and the state. How are you faring? Something I’ve heard over and over again from businesses of all sizes is that they have the jobs; they just can’t find the people. There seems to be a skills void that can’t be filled by the existing workforce.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally. If we reconsider the way we are training people and further promote the occupations that require special skills, but not a traditional bachelor’s degree, we can start to maximize the potential of our workforce. Let’s stop trying to make postsecondary education “one-size-fits-all” when our job needs and workforce are so varied.\n\nThis is something that I think and talk a lot about. I’m a son of the District and an unapologetic cheerleader for it. I’m invested, not just as the president of the Philadelphia Fed, but as someone who sees the great potential of this region. I want to see us become a destination for business, and that means making the best use of our greatest resource: our people.\n\nI should be clear that I don’t have the power to change any policy or enact any law that can bring that kind of investment. But I can make the economic case to the people who do. We need to attract talent, train the people we have, and make the tristate area a top destination, in part by offering a world-class workforce.\n\nIt’s Peter Drucker 101: Play to your strengths. I always tell people that the best business advice I have is to make yourself invaluable. I’d offer the same advice to any city or region looking to become a business destination.\n\nLabor Force Participation Rate\n\nI will also note that despite positive overall trends in the labor market, the participation rate is lower than I’d like.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is a fairly basic calculation. It divides the workforce — those employed and those looking for work — by the population over the age of 16. That does not include people who’ve taken themselves out of the labor force.\n\nThe participation rate has been declining over the years and it plummeted in the aftermath of the crisis and recession, which is what we would expect. Recessions cause dips in the participation rate and it tends to rebound as the economy does.\n\nBut over the past six years, it hasn’t risen back up as much as we might have thought. We can point to a number of reasons to explain this, but later on I will talk about one trend that’s something of a mystery.\n\nA portion of the drop is that we simply can’t meet historical surges. In the 60s and 70s, as women entered the workforce in greater numbers, the rate swelled. But we no longer have a large, untapped portion of the population that can offer the same boost. So, we have to readjust expectations somewhat.\n\nAnother contributing factor is lifestyle fit: Fewer high school and college students are working while they’re in school, and some people have decided that they’re content to have single-income households.\n\nThen there is the big one: demographics. The initial wave of the large baby boom generation has started to retire. As the boomers exit the workforce, they’re not being replaced in the same numbers. Not to mention, we’re living longer, so the share of people on the retirement end is even larger. This is the overwhelming factor affecting participation, and I’ll return to it shortly.\n\nAnd then there is the mystery of the missing prime-aged males. This very unfairly named group consists of men aged 25 to 54. For reasons that we’re not quite sure of, their participation has been dropping. In 1954, it was 98 percent, compared with 88 percent today.2 This makes for one of the lowest participation rates for prime-age males among developed countries and one of the most rapid declines.\n\nAgain, the impact has not been felt evenly. Among prime-age African American men, the participation rate has fallen from 91 percent in 1972 — the oldest data available — to 80.3 percent today.\n\nThere are some troubling features of this decline among all men. The first is that dropping out seems to be a persistent state. The majority of men who report not working in any given month hadn’t worked in the previous year either. The second is that this demographic, when employed, adds to overall productivity, so the economy feels the loss when they are out of the workplace.\n\nI do want to reiterate that the group we’re talking about are men who are out of the labor force. For prime-age males in the workforce, the unemployment rate is low and the U.S. fares a lot better than our counterparts.\n\nAs I said, we don’t really know why this is happening to any degree of certainty. It could be that men participate in the workforce more intensively in their thirties and forties, so it’s reasonable to assume the ageing population is playing a role. But when we analyze the data, it turns out that nonparticipation goes up as the age goes down. That is, the younger the age group, the more likely they are to be out of the workforce. The data also show that participation rates follow educational attainment.\n\nThe consequences for this group’s lack of participation are severe, both for them and the economy. Around one-third of nonparticipants live below the federal poverty line. Most get by on government assistance or financial support from spouses or other family members.\n\nFor the rest of us a lower participation rate all around means lower productivity, which means lower growth.\n\nIt’s essential to have a robust workforce. Research by my staff indicates that, due to demographics and the retiring baby boomers, the low participation trend is unlikely to reverse. In fact, they project labor force participation could drop up to 2 percentage points further over the next five years.3 That’s from where we stand now at 62.7 percent.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this all mean for monetary policy? After December’s meeting, that makes a brisk average of one 25-basis-point hike per year for the last two years.\n\nBut I see three modest hikes as appropriate for the coming year, assuming the economy stays on track. Fed policymakers enjoy saying we’re data-dependent and this is an area where that rings especially true.\n\nI’ve said it before, and it’s worth repeating, that monetary policy is a fairly limited set of tools with a fairly limited reach. We will respond to changes in the economy with moves in the federal funds rate, and we can do a very good job of creating the conditions that are consistent with economic growth. But the kinds of policies that will deliver that growth — employment programs, development, taxation, and trade policies — are up to elected officials at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, things are looking good. The labor market is strong and we’re creating jobs at a good pace. The drop in labor force participation must be addressed, but that will take legislative action. Inflation is moving back up to our 2 percent goal and growth is solid. We’re starting 2017 off on a good foot.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Adam Scavette and Ethan Haswell, “Is Urban Cool Cooling New Jersey’s Job Market?” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Research Brief, December 1, 2016.\n\n[2]Council of Economic Advisors. “The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation,” June 2014.\n\n[3]Shigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Research Rap Special Report, February 6, 2014.",

        "content": "Good morning and thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here.\n\nI’m going to keep my introductory remarks short, so we can get to the conversation more quickly. I’m following Ben Franklin’s advice that: “Silence is not always a sign of wisdom, but babbling is ever a mark of folly.”\n\nI think it’s probably wise to start with an explanation of why I’m even here. Why is this policy wonk, who raises and lowers interest rates, interested in inequality and prosperity?\n\nThe Federal Reserve actually has a strong interest in the subject. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which among other things, requires banks to meet the credit needs of all communities, including those of lower income. Originally, the Fed got involved to help banks fulfill their CRA requirements, and we still do. But our role has also evolved to be a primary conduit and convener for community organizations and the funders that can help. That’s everything from community investment funds to some of the world’s largest financial institutions. We don’t fund projects or organizations ourselves, but we do conduct research and help foster best practices.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know, the Federal Reserve System is divided into 12 regional banks around the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. Each District bank is independent and operates as a representative and reporter of economic issues in their region. The Philadelphia Fed District consists of Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, and Delaware.\n\nEach of the 12 regional banks has a community development and outreach function, and each does exceptional work. Obviously, I’m biased towards our bank, and I see Philadelphia as having a unique position and ability to conduct research and find real, sustainable solutions for some of our most intractable problems.\n\nThe other banks oversee bigger Districts — San Francisco has the nine western states and covers more than 20 percent of the country — but the Third District offers a microcosm of the issues and economics we see around much of the country: We have urban, rural, and postindustrial areas. We have small businesses and huge multinationals. We have industries using the cutting edge of technology and traditional manufacturing. In short, we have a perfect laboratory to study the way programs aimed at economic mobility and self-sufficiency work.\n\nI’ll give you an example. The unemployment rate for Pennsylvania is higher than the national average. But when I talk to employers and business owners, they say they can’t find qualified applicants. There are people out there who want jobs and employers who have them; the gap is in skills.\n\nMy staff recently conducted a study on what they call “opportunity occupations.” These are jobs that pay at or above the national median income, but that don’t require a traditional four-year degree. They make up close to 30 percent of the job market nationally.\n\nWe can help a lot of workers and a lot of businesses by emphasizing training and skills and looking at practical ways to get people into not just jobs, but careers. I recently went with my team to Roxborough High School, which is involved with the Philadelphia Academies project. Students at the Academies study a core discipline — the ones I talked to were concentrating on everything from international entrepreneurship to biotech — and will come out of high school ready to enter a profession, if they choose. Some may stay in that career for a long time, some will go on to do a conventional bachelor’s degree, and some will get more technical training. But all of them will have the skills to find a path that leads them to a prosperous life.\n\nThis is just one example of the kind of work my team is studying and the research they’re undertaking. They also are examining everything from healthy communities to housing to consumer credit. It’s a big job and the Third District has a lot to contend with. In 2004, only six of the 60 counties had poverty rates higher than the national average. By 2014, that number had risen to 11.\n\nFrom a monetary policymaker’s perspective, the issues of poverty and economic mobility are obviously important. We tend to speak of the economy as a whole, using a broad brush to paint a sweeping portrait of America. And that’s important. But the national economy is made up of a myriad of other economies — state, local, and community microeconomies. Each is like a single brushstroke. Each microeconomy has its own cause and effect and contributes to the overall picture. No one of them operates in isolation, and we should all remember that our neighbors’ economic fortunes are tied to our own. Studies in community development add depth and contour to what we see.\n\nI’ve always gone with the business mantra of “play to your strengths.” So, I look at the strengths of the District and the strengths of the Philadelphia Fed and see a way to make real change happen.\n\nI truly believe that this District can be an innovation lab. We have the demographics, the economic profile, and most importantly, extraordinary people with a strong sense of community. The Fed has world-class research talent and exceptional partners in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. Programs and solutions we find here can be adopted and adapted for towns and cities across the country.\n\nI know that’s a big challenge, but you can’t succeed if you don’t try, right?\n\nEconomic mobility happens when people have a level playing field. That’s what community development work fundamentally does: It tries to put everyone at the same point on the starting line and ensure each person has access to opportunity.\n\nWe know there is a cycle of poverty, and that poverty in one generation disproportionately leads to poverty in the next. It is a systemic hurdle to success. Raj Chetty, a leading economics professor, now at Stanford, is the go-to guy for this area of research. He and his coauthors found that where a child grows up has an effect on his or her upward mobility later in life. The likelihood of a child born into the bottom fifth of the income distribution reaching the top fifth varies markedly across the United States, from a low of 4.4 percent in Charlotte, NC, to a high of 12.9 percent in San Jose, CA. Philadelphia falls in between at 7.4 percent. The San Jose odds are much better than either Charlotte or Philadelphia; but they’re still lower than we should accept.1\n\nEven here in our metro region, the data continue to illustrate inequality across geography. A child who is raised in a low-income family in Bucks County will make over $4,000 more at age 26 than a child in a similar family in Philadelphia County.2\n\nI’ve talked a lot about the pragmatic reasons behind the importance of this work. But I’d also add that this is a moral imperative. We’re honoring Benjamin Franklin today, and that naturally evokes the philosophy and essence of what it means to be American. This is a country, perhaps more than any other, whose fundamental ethos is that anyone can be anything they want if they work hard. Ben Franklin himself is a testament to this. He left school at 10 to work full-time in his father’s candle shop, yet went on to become one of our most revered founding fathers.\n\nFranklin saw the value of helping people and places in the future. In his will, he left trusts to Boston and Philadelphia that were intentionally invested in 100- and 200-year periods, so the interest could compound. The money was then used to fund apprenticeship programs and civic projects in each city, as Franklin’s will directed. Even today, Franklin’s legacy funds scholarships, helping students to move up the economic ladder.\n\nAt the heart of this push for economic mobility is the quintessentially American belief that everyone should have an equal chance at success. It is the soul of democracy and the foundation of any fair society.\n\nThere isn’t one single barrier to moving up the economic ladder, and those barriers don’t come from a single source. There are multiple, tangled factors — education, training, affordable housing, child care, even basics like transportation. If you can’t get to work, you can’t work. Finding solutions to those problems takes a lot of sharp minds and hard work, and I think we can get there.\n\nMaybe someone as extraordinary as Ben Franklin would’ve succeeded anyway, if he’d been born today, despite having to leave school at such a young age. But what if the structural barriers wound up being too much? The next Ben Franklin could be out there, but barriers are preventing him — or her — from succeeding. And wouldn’t we all be worse off for that?\n\nOur aim at the Philadelphia Fed is to make sure economic growth is inclusive and that every person has access to the tools needed to achieve his or her fullest potential. We want to use our research and our convening abilities to find solutions that can be applied across the Third District and the country. To quote Ben again: “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Chetty, Raj, Nathaniel Hendren, Patrick Kline, and Emmanuel Saez. “Where Is the Land of Opportunity?

        "content": "Introduction\n\nGood morning; it’s a pleasure to be here. This is my first public speech since we raised rates in December as well as my first as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I’m trying not to take it personally that people seem to find my opinions much more interesting nowadays.\n\nToday, I’d like to give an overview of the economy, talk about the implications for monetary policy, and explore some of the issues affecting the region — particularly workforce development.\n\nBefore I start, however, I should add the usual disclaimer that the views expressed today are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nGrowth\n\nThe headline is that things are looking pretty good, or as I should say as a policy wonk: “The economy is displaying considerable strength.” Gross Domestic Product continued to grow in the third quarter at an even faster pace than in Q2. Third-quarter growth was recently revised up to 3.5 percent. That was driven largely by consumption.\n\nConsumer confidence is strong, retail sales are still solid — though slightly slower than previously anticipated — and equity markets are up.\n\nThe New Orders Index, though positive, fell slightly in December, though the Regional Business Activity Index increased sharply.\n\nAll in all, the snapshot is of a robust American economy.\n\nInflation\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In its simplest terms, that means that most people can find a job if they’re looking, and inflation stays low and stable.\n\nStarting with inflation, we aim for an average of 2 percent. A little higher or a little lower from time to time is not something to worry about. We don’t need to be exactly at 2 percent all the time. We’re looking for an average over the medium term.\n\nPeople sometimes assume that the Fed worries more about inflation being too high than too low. But we give equal weight to the distance from our goal regardless of the direction. Over the past few years, inflation has been below target. That’s the main reason interest rates have been so low for so long. We’re starting to see some upward movement in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy. This is a long name for the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Most economists simply call it “the core PCE,” and it has increased to 1.7 percent, near our target.\n\nI know the joke is that Fed policymakers must not eat or drive, because we prefer the core measure. But we’re looking for underlying trends and stripping out those volatile components gives us a better read. That said, the yearly growth in the headline PCE index has also increased, rising to 1.0 percent in the third quarter of 2016, from 0.3 percent a year earlier.\n\nAdditionally, inflation expectations are starting to rally around the 2 percent goal. One important facet of economics is that expectations can play a role in outcomes, particularly in inflation. It’s something of a monetary self-fulfilling prophecy. If markets believe inflation will remain low, it’s more likely to do so. And over the past few years, not everyone was on the same page with their predictions. But as expectations consolidate around our target rate, it makes it more likely that our target will become reality.\n\nLooking at all the information and the trends over the past few years, I see inflation on course to meet our target sometime this year or next.\n\nLabor market\n\nOn the employment side of things, we’re doing very well. We had another month of solid gains in December, with the economy adding 156,000 jobs. That’s an average of 165,000 over the last quarter of 2016.\n\nThe unemployment rate remains low at 4.7 percent, which is at, or below what most economists believe is its natural rate of about 5 percent. The natural rate is the rate that we expect in a healthy economy. Unemployment is never zero, because people will always move from job to job, and we add new people to the workforce every day.\n\nOf course, we don’t just look at the headline unemployment rate. And it should be noted that joblessness hits some portions of the population worse than other demographics. For instance, the unemployment rate for African-American males was 8.6 percent in December, almost four percentage points higher than the average for the entire adult population.\n\nThere’s also a lot of talk about hidden pockets of unemployment, with particular concern that people may have dropped out of the labor market entirely, out of frustration. But even the broadest measure of unemployment has declined. That’s the U6 measure, which takes into account people who aren’t currently looking for a job but say they want one and people who are working part-time but would like to be full-time. That rate has dropped to 9.2 percent. While that’s still higher than headline unemployment, it’s worth noting that U6 peaked at about 17 percent during the worst of the recession and its aftermath.\n\nDemand for labor also remains strong and more people are quitting their jobs. That’s good news for the economy — it shows workers are more confident they can find another one — though I suppose some overworked HR managers might not be 100 percent thrilled about it.\n\nLayoffs also remain at all-time lows and job postings are near historical peaks. We continue to hear from our business contacts that finding workers, especially in certain occupations, is getting progressively more difficult.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, it’s safe to call the U.S. labor market more or less at full health.\n\nYou’ll note my previous remarks referred to the economy as a whole. Things aren’t evenly distributed across this huge and diverse country. We’re in Pennsylvania and things are different here. The state’s unemployment rate has been higher than the national average, though it finally edged down in November, from 5.8 percent in October to 5.7 percent. That’s the first decrease since January of last year.\n\nEmployment growth has been slower as well: While the country has experienced a rate of 1.7 percent in job growth, we’ve seen a rate of just 0.6 percent.\n\nI point this out in part because this is when I get to praise the structure of the Federal Reserve System. I think it’s uniquely American to have a decentralized central bank. To have a structure that makes policy for a huge and incredibly varied economy, but takes into account the differences between regions. We know that the economic fortunes of Camden don’t look like those of Seattle. And when the FOMC comes together, the presidents of the 12 banks get to be a voice for their communities and businesses.\n\nI also mention it because I’m interested to hear your take on the employment situation in the area and the state.

For prime-age males in the workforce, the unemployment rate is low, and the U.S. fares a lot better than our counterparts.\n\nAs I said, we don’t really know why this is happening to any degree of certainty. It could be that men participate in the workforce more intensively in their thirties and forties, so it’s reasonable to assume the ageing population is playing a role. But when we analyze the data, it turns out that nonparticipation goes up as the age goes down. That is, the younger the age group, the more likely they are to be out of the workforce. The data also show that participation rates follow educational attainment.\n\nThe consequences for this group’s lack of participation are severe, both for them and the economy. Around one-third of nonparticipants live below the federal poverty line. Most get by on government assistance or financial support from spouses or other family members.\n\nFor the rest of us, a lower participation rate all-around means lower productivity, which means lower growth.\n\nIt’s essential to have a robust workforce. Research by my staff shows that, due to demographics and the retiring baby boomers, they don’t think the low participation trend will reverse. In fact, they project labor force participation could drop up to 2 percentage points further over the next five years.2 That’s from where we stand now at 62.7 percent.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nSo, what does this all mean for monetary policy? After December’s meeting, that makes a brisk average of one 25-basis-point hike per year for the last two years. But I see three modest hikes as appropriate for the coming year, assuming the economy stays on track. Fed policymakers enjoy saying we’re data-dependent and this is an area where that rings especially true.\n\nI’ve said it before, and it’s worth repeating, that monetary policy is a fairly limited set of tools with a fairly limited reach. We will respond to changes in the economy with moves in the federal funds rate, and we can do a very good job of creating the conditions that are consistent with economic growth. But the kinds of policies that will deliver that growth — employment programs, development, taxation, and trade policy — is up to elected officials at the local, state, and national levels.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll in all, things are looking good. The labor market is strong and we’re creating jobs at a good pace. The drop in labor force participation must be addressed, but that will take legislative action. Inflation is moving back up to our 2 percent goal, and growth is solid. We’re starting 2017 off on a good foot.\n\nNote: The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n[1]Council of Economic Advisors, June 2014. “The Long-Term Decline in Prime-Age Male Labor Force Participation,” June 2014, available at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov.pdf  (last accessed January 9, 2017).\n\n[2]Fujita, Shigeru. “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special Report, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (February 2014). https://philadelphiafedcm.ws.frb.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/research-rap/2014/on-the-causes-of-declines-in-the-labor-force-participation-rate.pdf?la=en.",
