The Charlotte Economics Club has\nwelcomed many leading Federal Reserve voices to this podium over the years, including\na number of my fellow Fed presidents. You have heard from President Jeff Lacker of the\nRichmond Fed, which has its Charlotte Branch over on East Trade Street, as well as\nPresidents Richard Fisher of Dallas and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta. So I am pleased to\nhave been included among your distinguished guests.\nOn November 16, the Federal Reserve observed the 100th anniversary of the opening of\nall 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the country on the same day. These institutions\nalong with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., comprise our nation’s\ndecentralized central bank. This decentralized structure is one of the System’s great\n1\n\n\fstrengths. Not only does it promote a diversity of views, but it also helps to build public\ntrust and preserve independence. However, it requires that I begin by reminding you\nthat the views I express today are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nYour program chair, Professor Rob Roy McGregor, has spent a great deal of his academic\ncareer studying the workings of the FOMC — including the use of power by the Chair\nand the nature of consensus building and dissent within the Committee. Interestingly,\nsome of this work has been coauthored with a former colleague of mine at the\nPhiladelphia Fed, Todd Vermilyea, who now works at the Board of Governors.\nToday, I plan to talk about the importance of taking a longer-term view in setting\nmonetary policy. We live in a 24-hour news cycle that focuses a lot of time and energy\non analyzing the tea leaves from the daily onslaught of new economic data at our\ndisposal. Yet, I believe it is a mistake for policymakers to focus too intently on the most\nrecent numbers to justify a policy decision. Our data are always noisy and often subject\nto substantial revision, as we just witnessed with last week’s GDP revisions and as we\nsee regularly with the monthly employment report. Instead, we must focus our\nattention on the underlying trends and the likely path of the economy over the\nintermediate to longer-term horizon.\nOne reason why policymakers must think long term is that the effects of monetary\npolicy actions on inflation and employment may not be felt for many quarters and\nmaybe years in the future. Thus, the near term path of the economy is unlikely to be\naltered in any significant way by today’s policy choices. We must look further ahead in\nassessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy. Of course, there is a great deal of\nuncertainty about the future and that too has implications for how we should approach\npolicy.\n2\n\n\fI will begin with a brief overview of the economy as one policymaker sees it as we near\nthe end of 2014.\nEconomic Conditions\nOver the past year, we have seen encouraging signs in the economy. The most recent\nestimate of annualized real GDP growth in the third quarter was 3.9 percent, which\nfollowed strong growth in the second quarter of 4.6 percent. Taking a longer view,\ngrowth from the third quarter of last year to this year was 2.4 percent. But this includes\na negative 2.1 percent growth rate in the first quarter of 2014 that was a consequence\nof a severe winter and was largely transitory in nature. We are seeing continued\nstrength in personal consumption, especially in durable goods, as well as business fixed\ninvestment, which marked the strongest two quarter growth in investment by\nbusinesses in nearly three years.\nGDP growth has averaged 2.3 percent over the 21 quarters of the recovery since mid2009. That is a half point below the 5-year growth rates measured during most of the\n2000s before the recession, which is, in part, why this recovery is often seen as being\nmoderate or modest from an historical perspective.\nNonetheless, we have seen a sustained improvement in the manufacturing sector. The\nNovember reading from the Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey\nindicated very strong growth in manufacturing activity. Even more encouraging are the\nsustained increases we have witnessed in this sector. After a mediocre performance\nfrom mid-2011 to mid-2013, the index has now been positive for nearly 18 consecutive\nmonths, with the only aberration in February 2014 during the depths of our severe\nwinter weather. Our index is often viewed as a useful indicator of national\nmanufacturing activity, and indeed the national ISM manufacturing index has also\nshown solid performance over the past 18 months.\n3\n\n\fThe labor market has also strengthened over the year. Employers added jobs at an\naverage rate of 229,000 per month in the first 10 months of the year, which is 18\npercent higher than the rate in 2013, and it’s the highest we have seen at any point in\nthe recovery. This acceleration in job growth has helped bring the unemployment rate\ndown to 5.8 percent as of October, compared with 7.2 percent a year ago.\nOver the course of this recovery, the unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10\npercent in October 2009 to 5.8 percent today. Other measures of unemployment have\nalso declined. For example, the measure called U6, which includes marginally attached\nworkers and those working part time for economic reasons, has fallen from its peak of\n17.2 percent to 11.5 percent.\nInflation, for the moment, remains well contained. The personal consumption\nexpenditures, or PCE, price index, the measure of inflation preferred by the FOMC,\nregistered a 1.4 percent increase over the 12 months through October. It is running\nsomewhat below the FOMC’s stated longer-term target of 2 percent, but it remains\nabove the level that should stoke concerns of sustained deflation.\nFalling energy prices are generally good news for consumers and a favorable\ndevelopment for the economy going forward. In the short term, the decline in the\nrelative price of energy will show up in lower headline inflation, but as energy prices\nstabilize, headline inflation will increase. Policymakers tend to look through such\nvolatile and transitory price changes to assess the underlying trend in inflation. The\ncore PCE index, which excludes food and energy, is a bit higher than the overall\nmeasure, increasing 1.6 percent over the 12 months through October. Other measures\nof inflation, including those that attempt to reduce the weight given to large outliers in\nany given month, all tend to suggest that inflation is running between 1.5 percent and 2\npercent. Given the precision with which we can measure such things, I find this\n4\n\n\foutcome satisfactory. Nevertheless, I anticipate that the FOMC will conduct policy over\ntime in such a manner that inflation will gradually move toward the Fed’s 2 percent\ntarget. Private sector forecasters seem to share this view as the Philadelphia Fed’s most\nrecent Survey of Professional Forecasters shows that long-term inflation expectations\nremain stable at 2 percent.\nMonetary Policy\nIn my discussion of the economy, I have emphasized the longer-run path of the recovery\nrather than the month-to-month fluctuations. Viewed in this context, it is clear that the\neconomy has come a long way since the recovery began in June 2009. To me, that\nmeans we should no longer be conducting monetary policy as if we were still in the\nmidst of a financial crisis or in the depths of a recession.\nThe financial crisis was an extraordinary event, and much of the commentary on\nmonetary policy has focused on the actions of central banks in response to the financial\ncrisis. That is appropriate and understandable. Yet, there is another lesson to be\nlearned from the past six years that I think is important to recognize. And that is how\ndifficult it is for monetary policy to fine-tune real growth in the economy. Despite the\nFOMC’s stated desire and aggressive actions to accelerate the pace of the recovery,\ngrowth has proceeded at a moderate pace since the end of the crisis. Monetary policy\nhas simply not proved to be the panacea that many had hoped. As I have argued on a\nnumber of occasions, I believe we have come to expect too much from monetary policy.\nWe would be better served by greater humility and lowered expectations of the\npotential for monetary policy to manage real economic growth and employment.\nTen years ago, I suspect most commentators would have told you that six years of a\nnear-zero federal funds rate target and more than $3.5 trillion of long-term asset\npurchases by the Fed would likely produce an economic boom in the near term and\nwould risk inflation in the longer term. Well, although we have experienced modest\n5\n\n\fgrowth, we have not experienced a boom, and the jury remains out as to whether\ninflation will materialize as a consequence. Some argue that the absence of the boom is\nbecause the Fed didn’t do enough — more was needed to offset the constraint of the\nzero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Of course, there is an alternative\nhypothesis: Monetary policy was not capable of offsetting or mitigating the sorts of real\nchallenges the economy was facing. Distinguishing between these two hypotheses will\nundoubtedly be the subject of intense research in the coming decades. After all,\neconomists are still studying the policy choices and their effects during the Great\nDepression eight decades ago.\nBut let me turn our attention to how monetary policy should evolve going forward. I\nbegan my remarks by noting that monetary policy should focus on the intermediate to\nlonger term and be less sensitive or reactive to short-run and transitory movements in\nthe data. To that end, I see the economy continuing to improve with real growth\naveraging about 3 percent in 2015 before coming back down to its long-term trend\ngrowth rate of about 2.4 percent. Employment will continue to expand, and inflation\nwill move closer to our 2 percent target. While people can disagree about the extent to\nwhich the labor market has healed, it is clear that the labor market is in much better\nshape than it was in 2009 when unemployment reached its peak of 10 percent. The\neconomy has come a long way, and monetary policy should reflect such progress.\nThis progress suggests that monetary policy should begin to normalize. Keeping the\nfunds rate target near zero when inflation is close to our goal and the economy is near\nfull employment is both unprecedented and risky in my view. Waiting too long to begin\nthe process of raising the policy rate risks facing the possibility that the rate may have to\nincrease rapidly when the time comes and that could prove unnecessarily disruptive.\nAnd waiting could also risk a more rapid pickup in inflation.\nOf course, policymakers face many uncertainties, and so they must be prepared to\n6\n\n\fadjust policy as the underlying trends in inflation and the real economy evolve. So, how\nshould a central bank best inform the public about those uncertainties and the\nprospective path of policy?\nThe appropriate way to communicate the future of policy is to describe in a general way\na reaction function. That is to describe what key economic variables influence the\nsetting of policy and to give a sense of how policy will change in response to changes in\nthose variables. Over the past several years, I have criticized policy messages that\nsuggest that calendar time is a relevant metric for determining a policy action. We must\navoid such date-based forward guidance, whether it uses specific calendar dates or\nmore vague references alluding to a “considerable period” of time. As policymakers, we\ndo not know what the future holds, so forward guidance in this form cannot be very\ncredible.\nUnfortunately, it is unlikely that policymakers will adopt a specific reaction function in\nthe near term. Yet, there are numerous examples of such systematic approaches or\nreaction functions that can help us to gauge the stance of policy. Some of these\nreaction functions have been shown to be robust in a variety of circumstances and\nuseful in describing past monetary policy behaviors. They can, I believe, provide useful\nguidelines for assessing the stance and the likely path of monetary policy. They can also\nbe useful in communicating policy to the public. I frequently consider such reaction\nfunctions as I think about policy. These are typically Taylor-like rules named for the\nStanford University economist John Taylor who first proposed them in the early 1990s.\nThese policy rules typically call for the targeted funds rate to respond to deviations of\ninflation from some desired target and to deviations of output from some measure of\npotential — sometimes referred to as economic “slack” or the “gap.” Sometimes such\ngaps are translated into deviations from full employment.\nThese policy rules can offer useful guideposts for policymakers and the public in\n7\n\n\fassessing the stance of monetary policy, and communicating more about such\nguideposts would enhance transparency and help make policy more systematic. Thus,\nthere is no need to mechanically follow any particular rule, and judgment will always be\nrequired. Yet, policymakers and the public should be very cautious when they call for\npolicy rates to deviate in important or significant ways from these guideposts. Making\nsuch judgments should require careful analysis, and the justification for deviating from\nsuch guidelines should be clearly communicated to the markets and to the public.\nA monetary policy strategy such as I have just described could be communicated\nthrough a regular Monetary Policy Report, perhaps published quarterly. The report\nwould offer an opportunity to reinforce the underlying policy framework of the\nCommittee and how it relates to current and expected economic conditions.\nPublishing a Monetary Policy Report with an assessment of the likely near-term path of\npolicy rates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, would also provide added\ndiscipline for policymakers to stick to a systematic, rule-like approach. Communication\nabout that path, in turn, gives the public a much deeper understanding of the analytical\napproach that guides monetary policy, thus making policy more transparent and\npredictable.\nIn the current environment, an assessment of a variety of these robust rules suggests\nthat the funds rate target is no longer constrained by the zero lower bound. These rules\nindicate that liftoff of the funds rate target from zero should have already occurred or\nshould occur in the very near future. It is important to point out that all of these rules\nrecognize and take into account the fact that the inflation rate remains somewhat\nbelow the FOMC’s target of 2 percent. Nevertheless, they do not call for maintaining\nthe funds rate target near zero.\nThese rules are helpful because they not only suggest when liftoff should occur, but they\n8\n\n\foffer guidance about the future path of rate changes, given the likely direction of the\neconomy — that is, forecasts of inflation and employment “gaps.” Even more important\nis that if the forecasts of the future change, these guideposts can highlight how the\nentire policy path is likely to evolve. As such, they are capable of better aligning the\npublic’s expectations of policy with those of the FOMC, making the conduct of monetary\npolicy more accountable and more efficient.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the U.S. economy continues to recover at a moderate pace. Although we\nhave not witnessed the strong bounce back from the depths of the recession that some\nanticipated, the recovery has been somewhat remarkable in the steadiness with which it\nhas progressed. Labor markets continue to heal, and their stronger-than-expected\nrecovery should serve to underpin continued economic expansion. Consumer balance\nsheets are much improved, and individuals have regained significant fractions of the\nwealth they lost during the crisis. That gives me additional confidence that the economy\nis now operating fairly normally and that policy should reflect that normalization.\nPolicy can also be made more transparent and effective by specifying more completely\nthe variables that guide policy and the general way that one can expect policymakers to\nreact to those variables. To this end, I believe the FOMC should move forward to\ndescribe in a qualitative way its reaction function and then communicate our actions\nand decisions in terms of this reaction function. A detailed Monetary Policy Report\ncould be a useful vehicle for such enhanced communication by discussing a range of\nrobust policy rules. Placing policy choices in such a context will lead to a more\nsystematic approach to policy and one that is more transparent and predictable.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHighlights\n•\n\nPresident Charles Plosser gives his views on the debate about a new normal for economic\ngrowth in the U.S. economy.\n\n•\n\nWhile some economists believe we are in a secular stagnation with low growth and reduced\nproductivity that may persist for some time, President Plosser sides with those who think it is\nimpossible to predict the state of future technology.\n\n•\n\nPresident Plosser notes, though, that monetary policy is not a tool that can fix such a secular\nstagnation in any case.\n\nIntroduction\nI would like to thank George Washington University and Princeton University’s Griswold Center\nfor Economic Policy Studies for organizing this event. I also am delighted to be here with my\nfellow panelists, Frank Schorfheide of the University of Pennsylvania, who is a regular visiting\nscholar at the Philadelphia Fed, Neal Soss of Credit Suisse, and, of course, our moderator,\nBinyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times. As usual, I should remind everyone that my\nremarks today are my own views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or\nmy colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nThe question of whether we are facing the prospect of some sort of new economic normal or\nsteady state growth path is a challenging one. Some have pondered whether the severity of\nthe financial crisis and recession, or perhaps even the policy responses to these events, have\nushered in a period of low growth and reduced productivity that may persist for some time.\n\n1\n\n\fOthers have suggested the seeds of a secular decline in growth predate the recession. This\nview stresses an evolving secular decline arising from a weakening in the rate of innovation and\nthe productivity gains that such innovation often fosters. This view also points to demographic\nfactors, such as an aging population, that will strain government programs that transfer\nresources from workers to the elderly.\nThe evolution of longer-run growth also has implications for the longer-term real interest rate,\nwhich is largely determined by the growth in per capita consumption and the growth rate in\npopulation. In turn, the growth in per capita consumption depends on productivity gains and\nthe share of the population engaged in production. The implications of these factors on the\nreal interest rate is, of course, relevant for central bankers as they seek to set a policy rate to\nstabilize prices and promote sustainable growth. Yet, it is important to note that monetary\npolicy is not capable of reversing or mitigating such secular slowdowns. Consequently, it is at\nbest tangential to the efforts of a nation seeking to address secular declines in growth.\nIn my brief time, I will highlight some of the issues underlying the views of a secular slowdown.\nThat said, however, I want to emphasize that it is very hard to determine with any precision the\nlonger-term growth rate of the economy. It often takes many years of data to establish any\ndegree of confidence in asserting a change in a trend. As a result, it should come as no surprise\nthat I do not have an answer for the question whether we are facing a new normal. Instead, I\nwill offer observations on what I believe are some of the key issues that make such assessments\nso challenging.\nLong-Run Trends\nLet me start with the question of future productivity growth, since it is the most fundamental\ndeterminant of economic prosperity. Recently, Robert Gordon has advanced the notion that\nwe are in for a bout of long-term secular stagnation. 1 His writings reflect the idea, also\n1\n\nSee Gordon, “Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds” and “The Demise\nof U.S. Economic Growth: Restatement, Rebuttal, and Reflections.”\n\n2\n\n\fproposed by Tyler Cowen, that all the low-hanging fruit has been picked and that technological\nadvances will become increasingly more difficult.2 On the other hand, scholars such as Joel\nMokyr, Erik Brynjolfsson, and Andrew McAfee do not see any reason to anticipate a long-lasting\ndecline in human ingenuity.\nGordon has produced some provocative research concerning the demise of economic growth in\nthis country. He describes a number of headwinds, four of which are relevant for my\ndiscussion: slowing innovation, reduced growth in human capital due to a dysfunctional\neducation system, slower population growth, and the associated changing age distribution.\nThese four components are important because economic growth and the natural level of the\nreal interest are directly affected by growth in total factor productivity. Further, slower growth\nin population or declines in participation rates due to aging, other things being equal, can\nreduce the natural or long-run real rate of interest and lower per-capita economic growth.\nGordon’s view of stagnation is based on his evaluation of data over a long sweep of economic\nhistory. He has noted a decrease in total factor productivity, a decline in the growth rate of\nhuman capital, reduced hours per worker, and a decline in labor force participation rates. He\ndates the beginning of stagnation in these factors to 1972. For the 80 years before then,\nGordon asserts that economic growth was sparked by three great inventions: the electric light\nbulb, the internal combustion engine, and wireless signals. He noted that these three\ninventions eventually led to rounds of spinoffs that transformed society. Gordon sees no such\nround of spinoffs from the IT revolution, biotech, or such advances as 3-D printing.3\nEconomic historians such as Joel Mokyr are a bit more cautious, believing much as I do that it is\n\n2\n\nSee Cowen, The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and\nWill (Eventually) Feel Better.\n3\nGordon believes that future developments from existing or even yet-to-be-invented technologies are reasonably\npredictable, for instance, citing Jules Verne as one such visionary. I don’t see why he then chooses to ignore the\nimagination of Gene Roddenberry: Think iPhones, needleless injections, and touch-screen computers, to name a\nfew.\n\n3\n\n\fnearly impossible to predict the state of future technology.4 He notes that the 20th century\nexperienced considerable technological advancement, even in the face of considerable\nheadwinds, including two world wars, a cold war, and the Great Depression. Some might\nargue, however, that the world wars were not a headwind but a boost to technological\nadvancement.\nIt also may be that some impediments to innovation are not endemic to the nature or science\nof technological progress, but instead they are created by governments and thus can be\nreversed. For example, does increased regulation make the development of new drugs more\ncostly and risky? Could the significant increase in financial regulation after the financial crisis\nreduce the productivity of intermediation and thus impede investment and possibly the rate of\ngrowth? Or have increased taxes on the returns to saving and investment to support transfer\nprograms potentially reduced productivity growth? Regulatory and tax burdens can often act\nto reduce entrepreneurial activity and innovation and thus retard productivity growth. Such\ncosts must be weighed against any perceived benefits of such burdens.\nBrynjolfsson and McAfee are very optimistic about the future. They believe that we are at an\ninflection point and that a substantial period of more robust economic growth awaits us in the\nnot-too-distant future. 5 They point out that many revolutionary discoveries, such as DNA\nsequencing, occurred by creatively stringing together prior scientific procedures. They point\nout that the improvements in computational speeds and algorithmic developments are making\ncomputers capable of stringing together ideas, which could result in significant improvements\nin productivity.\nI believe technological advancement and the increased productivity it can foster is the\noverwhelming driving force behind economic growth. Demographic factors that may drive\n\n4\n\nSee Mokyr, “The Next Age of Invention.”\nSee Brynjolfsson and McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant\nTechnologies.\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\fhours per worker and labor force participation are relatively insignificant when compared with\ninnovation’s effects on productivity. After all, the remarkable growth of the 20th century\noccurred with a significant decline in the workweek from 60 hours to less than 40, as well as a\nsignificant increase in vacation or leisure time. It is hard to envision a decline of similar\nmagnitude going forward. Thus, I continue to have faith in the promise of human ingenuity and\ndo not envision the dire outcomes envisioned by Gordon.6 That does not mean that we won’t\nexperience spurts of unusually high- and low-productivity growth, but those periods are likely\nto be identified and understood only well after the fact.\nThe arguments presented by both sides of the secular stagnation debate highlight that the\nfuture could unfold in very different ways. I think there is no doubt that longer-term growth\nrates can and do vary, and thus, longer-term real interest rates also vary. Yet, such movements\ntend to occur gradually and are very difficult to assess with any precision in real time. As my\ndiscussion suggests, we should focus on policies designed to enhance innovation and\nproductivity if we are to continue to improve per capita consumption and general economic\nwelfare.\nMonetary Policy\nHow do variations in the longer-term growth rate of the economy, and thus the longer-term\nreal rate of interest, affect monetary policy? First, I want to reiterate that long-term growth is\nprimarily determined by productivity growth. Monetary policy is not an appropriate tool for\naddressing perceived declines in productivity. However, assessments of long-run potential\ngrowth can influence the setting of monetary policy because they influence the steady-state or\nlong-run real interest rate. If steady-state real rates are lower, then the so-called “neutral\nsetting of monetary policy” would also be lower. That is, the neutral funds rate would be\nlower.\n\n6\n\nSummers in “U.S. Economic Prospects: Secular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound” offers different\nconcerns. He argues that the real rate of interest may have declined to very low, or even negative, levels leading\nto the possibility of an inefficient equilibrium and a form of secular stagnation.\n\n5\n\n\fThe debate about a secular decline in growth today thus translates into a discussion of where,\nor how high, the neutral policy rate should be. So, the higher it is relative to the current funds\nrate, the more aggressive policy might have to be and vice versa. But there are other factors\nthat could complicate the policy path. If potential output is lower in the future than previously\nthought, then there is likely to be less “slack” in the current economy than one might think. So,\n“output gaps” are likely to be smaller, which in many policy rules would suggest higher interest\nrates, other things being equal. While a lower steady-state real rate may act to shift down the\nneutral rate, the effects on the dynamic path of policy as it returns to the neutral are somewhat\nmore complex.\nWhile the expected neutral funds rate is something that may be relevant, estimating and\ncommunicating a value with any confidence would be challenging. Measuring longer-run\ntrends is a difficult and delicate issue. Because expectations about monetary policy are\nimportant, particularly in financial markets, it may be useful for the FOMC to indicate what\nranges are likely for the neutral federal funds rate. But given the uncertainties, this may be\ndifficult and conveying a false sense of precision may prove to be counterproductive.\nSo, I believe, adjustments to the perceived neutral funds rate should be done with great care\nand discipline. They should not be done in response to the typical cyclical fluctuations in real\nrates. Our ability to truly assess a significant shift in the longer-term real rate is quite limited,\nand, in the presence of such uncertainty and measurement error, one should be careful not to\nconfuse the public.\nConclusions\nIn summary, there is a lively debate about the future of innovation and other factors that shape\nour prospects for growth. My own view is that human ingenuity and innovation will continue to\nbe a source of productivity growth. But that does not mean we should be complacent about\nour future. Productivity is the ultimate means to economic prosperity and we should\n6\n\n\fundertake policies that promote innovation and technological progress and eliminate practices\nthat discourage such progress.\nMonetary policy has a limited role to play in this endeavor except as it can promote a stable\nenvironment to allow these long-run forces to succeed. Yet, the appropriate setting of\nmonetary policy can be affected by the longer-term trends. Failure to adjust to such trends can\nlead to deviations from a central bank’s inflation target. Yet, distinguishing short-run or\ntransitory fluctuations from more permanent or persistent movements in growth and real\ninterest rates is a tricky and difficult task. It is near impossible in real time. These\nconsiderations lead me to believe that monetary policymakers should take great care in making\nsignificant adjustments in their view of the neutral policy rate.\nWe live in a constantly changing world and one that will hopefully be full of surprising new\ndevelopments that enhance economic welfare.\nReferences\nBrynjolfsson, Erik, and Andrew McAfee.

I want to thank our host Axel Weber for\nthat kind introduction and for inviting me to speak at this annual conference and to\nparticipate in the upcoming panel on monetary policy with fellow central bankers. I am\nlooking forward to a lively and interesting discussion.\nIn a few days, on November 16, 2014, we will mark the 100th anniversary of the date\nwhen the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, each independently chartered with oversight by a\nBoard of Governors in Washington, D.C, first opened their doors. Of course, among\ncentral banks, this makes the Fed the new kid on the block compared with the Bank of\nEngland; it also makes the Fed perhaps an older sibling to the ECB. I view the\ndecentralized structure of the Federal Reserve as one of its great strengths. However, it\nrequires that I begin by reminding you that the views I express this morning are my own\n1\n\n\fand do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nLet me begin with an update on the U.S. economy. The U.S. is now more than five years\ninto a steady, if unremarkable, recovery that began in June 2009. The unemployment\nrate has gone from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.8 percent in October of\nthis year. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined to a 2.1 percent annual rate in the\nfirst quarter of 2014 due to a severe winter. However, second-quarter GDP growth\nrebounded to 4.6 percent. The advance estimate for the third-quarter GDP growth is a\nsolid 3.5 percent.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP, has\nrecovered from 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter, to average 2.2 percent over the\nsecond and third quarters.\nI anticipate that consumer and business spending will help real GDP to grow at about 3\npercent for the second half of this year and for 2015 before reverting to trend, which I\nsee as about 2.4 percent.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey has proven to be a\nreliable indicator of manufacturing trends in the U.S. In October, manufacturers\nreported the eighth consecutive month in positive territory and well above its average\nnonrecession level. The survey’s future activity indexes also remained at high levels,\nsuggesting continued optimism about manufacturing growth. In addition, the\nPhiladelphia Fed now releases a monthly Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey,\nwhich showed that the region’s service sectors continued to grow in October, with\nimprovement in general activity, new orders, and sales or revenues. Nonmanufacturing\nfirms also continue to be optimistic about activity during the next six months.\n2\n\n\fLast week’s employment numbers showed employers adding 214,000 jobs in October.\nRevisions for September and August added 31,000 more jobs than originally estimated.\nInterestingly, what we once thought was a weak jobs report for August now shows we\nadded 203,000 jobs, which means that we have had nine months of job growth above\n200,000 for the first time in nearly 20 years. In all, employers have added more than 2.3\nmillion jobs thus far in 2014, at an average pace of 229,000 per month through October.\nThe unemployment rate in October was 5.8 percent, well below the 6.7 percent we\nexperienced in December 2013. Whereas the headline U3 measure fell 0.9 percentage\npoints since December 2013, the broader U6 measure, which includes discouraged\nworkers and involuntary part-time workers, dropped 1.6 points, from 13.1 percent to\n11.5 percent, its lowest since September 2008.\nThe unemployment rate continues to fall faster than many policymakers had been\nforecasting. For instance, in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), submitted in\nDecember 2013, the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the\nunemployment rate at the end of 2014 was 6.3 to 6.6 percent, dropping to 5.8 to 6.1\npercent at the end of 2015. We have clearly exceeded these expectations. At 5.8\npercent, the unemployment rate is already notably below where the Committee\nthought it would be at the end of 2014 and is at the low point in the range expected at\nthe end of 2015. Thus, it is fair to say that we are at least a year ahead of where we\nthought we would be when we started to taper asset purchases.\nThis is not to claim that all is rosy in the labor markets. Many Americans remain\nfrustrated and disappointed in their jobs and job prospects. For example, a large\ncontingent of those working part time for economic reasons would like to be working\nfull time. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that significant progress has been\nmade.\n3\n\n\fInflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, but it has\nrisen since last year. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In\nOctober 2013, inflation stood at 0.9 percent. The most recent reading for September\n2014 was 1.4 percent. Other measures of inflation have risen modestly as well. While\ninflation remains somewhat below the Fed’s target, the gap seems to be gradually\nclosing.\nAs noted by the FOMC in the October 2014 statement, the Committee believes it is\nunlikely that inflation will remain persistently below our long-term goal. The FOMC has\nstated that it expects the inflation rate to rise gradually to the 2 percent target, and I\nagree with that assessment. However, over the next quarter or two, headline inflation\nis likely to ease somewhat, reflecting the decline in the dollar price of oil and other\ntemporary factors. But looking through such transitory changes in relative prices, the\nFOMC sees underlying inflation gradually moving toward its 2 percent target. Thus,\nsince last year, the economy has moved closer to the Committee’s goals and has done\nso more quickly than anticipated.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, let me turn to some thoughts on monetary policy. The Fed has taken extraordinary\nmonetary policy actions, keeping the federal funds rate near zero for nearly six years\nand expanding its balance sheet to about $4.5 trillion.\nYet, the recovery began over five years ago, and the unemployment rate has declined\nfrom 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.8 percent now. Whether you believe that the\nlabor market has fully recovered or not, it is clear that the economy has made\nconsiderable progress toward full employment and price stability. We are no longer in\nthe depths of a financial crisis nor is the labor market in the same dire straits it was five\n4\n\n\fyears ago. To me, that means we should no longer be conducting monetary policy as if\nwe were still in the midst of a financial crisis or in the depths of a recession.\nIn its October statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative stance. In\ndoing so, it acknowledged that the economy had made significant progress. Therefore,\nas widely anticipated, the Committee brought to a close its asset purchase program.\nHowever, the Committee indicated that it would continue its practice of reinvesting\nprincipal payments. This should maintain the size of the Fed’s balance sheet at its\ncurrent, and sizable, level.\nThe Committee also adjusted its language somewhat regarding the expected path of\ninterest rates — the federal funds rate more specifically. In particular, the Committee\nreiterated its assessment that it would likely maintain the current target range of 0 to ¼\npercent for the fed funds rate for a “considerable time” after the end of the purchases.\nAs some of you may be aware, I objected to this forward guidance in both the July and\nSeptember meetings because it conveyed a date-based approach to guidance rather\nthan a data-based approach. I also objected to the fact that it failed to acknowledge the\nprogress made during the last year toward full employment and price stability.\nWhile the Committee retained the “considerable time” language, it added clarity by\nstressing the fact that the decision to lift the interest rate target would be driven by the\ndata. The Committee explicitly noted that should the economy make faster progress\nthan anticipated toward its goals, liftoff could occur earlier, and if progress was slower\nthan anticipated, liftoff could be delayed. From my perspective, this is the operative\nlanguage and it makes clear that the Committee intends for policy to be datadependent. It provides a start, but we could offer greater clarity as I will explain in a\nmoment.\nAs I said, we have moved much closer to our goals since last year, and, accordingly, the\nstance of monetary policy should reflect such progress and begin to adjust gradually.\n5\n\n\fThat is the essence of being data dependent. Given the progress to date, we must\nacknowledge and thus prepare the markets for the fact that interest rates may begin to\nincrease sooner than previously anticipated. I felt that adjusting our language was the\nappropriate first step in responding to better-than-anticipated economic conditions.\nMore generally, how do I think about the stance of policy and how it should be adjusted\nas the economy evolves? My view is informed by realized and projected economic\nprogress toward our goals. But it is also influenced by guidance gained from the\nconduct of past monetary policy — that is, historical experience. In particular, my views\non the appropriate funds rate setting are — and continue to be — informed by Taylortype monetary policy rules that depict the past behavior of monetary policy in response\nto deviation from its desired inflation target and economic activity from its natural or\nefficient level. I find such rules useful for benchmarking my policy prescriptions. These\nrules have been widely investigated and have been shown to be robust in that they\ndeliver good results in a wide variety of models and circumstances.\nThe guidance I take from such robust rules is that we should no longer consider\nmonetary policy as being constrained by the zero lower bound. A variety of these rules,\nwhich I discussed in a speech earlier this summer, indicates that given the current\ninflation rate of just under our target of 2 percent and the current unemployment rate\nof 5.8 percent, the funds rate should be above zero or should be lifting off in the very\nnear future. 1 In fact, maintaining a funds rate target near zero is unprecedented under\nsuch circumstances and, as such, could pose risks to the economy in the years ahead,\nincluding higher inflation and financial instability.\n\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club of\nNew York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014.\n\n6\n\n\fThere is a point of view that rates cannot be raised because the labor market has not\ncompletely healed. That is, we must wait, maintaining our current stance of policy until\nwe have achieved our goals. I think this is a risky strategy for three reasons.\nFirst, we do not know how to confidently determine whether the labor market is fully\nhealed or when we have reached full employment. In January 2012, the FOMC affirmed\nin its statement of longer run goals and strategies that, “The maximum level of\nemployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be\ndirectly measurable.” Chair Yellen gave an excellent speech at the Jackson Hole\nconference in August that highlighted some of the structural and nonmonetary factors\naffecting the labor market. Economists don’t fully understand the degree to which\nthese factors may be influencing our efforts to assess the meaning and measurement of\nfull employment.\nSecond, if we wait until we are certain that the labor market has fully recovered before\nbeginning to raise rates, policy will be far behind the curve. One risk of waiting is that\nthe Committee may be forced to raise rates very quickly to prevent an increase in\ninflation. In so doing, this may create unnecessary volatility and a rapid tightening of\nfinancial conditions — either of which could be disruptive to the economy.\nThis would represent a return of the so-called “go-stop” policies of the past. Such\nlanguage was used to describe episodes when the Fed was aggressively providing\nmonetary accommodation to stimulate employment and the economy — the go phase\n— only to find itself forced to apply the brakes abruptly to prevent a rapid uptick in\ninflation — the stop phase. This approach to policy led to more volatility and was more\ndisruptive than many found desirable.\n\n7\n\n\fA third risk to waiting is that the zero interest rate policy has generated a very\naggressive reach for yield as investors take on either credit or duration risk to earn\nhigher returns. While the Fed is attempting to monitor such behavior, it is difficult to\nknow how or where the consequences of such actions may show up. It seems to me\nthat the law of unintended consequences looms large in this arena.\nFor these reasons, I would prefer that we start to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nThis may allow us to increase rates more gradually as the data improve rather than face\nthe prospect of a more abrupt increase in rates to catch up with market forces, which\ncould be the outcome of a prolonged delay in our willingness to act. Of course, financial\nmarkets are not always patient, so some volatility will be unavoidable.\nOf course, there are also risks of moving too soon as tightening financial conditions\ncould stifle a fragile recovery, and some argue that this is the greater risk. However, it is\nimportant to recognize that rates always rise during a recovery — always. Thus, rising\nrates are not inconsistent with a continuing recovery. The inflation-adjusted or real\nfederal funds rate in the U.S. is notably negative, and it has been for some time. A\nnegative real rate is neither sustainable nor desirable when an economy is growing at 2\nto 3 percent and is near full employment.\nIn addition, by referring to historical experience as captured in some of the rules I\nmentioned, we can determine, to a degree, the economic conditions that have been\nconsistent with rising rates in the past. And as I discussed, these rules suggest that,\ngiven current conditions, we should begin raising rates in the near future. Moreover, it\nis important to recognize that these rule-like guidelines take into account the fact that\ninflation is running below our target. They do not tell us that we should keep rates at\nzero until inflation rises to 2 percent any more than they tell us to keep rates at zero\nuntil we reach full employment. They tell us that the stance of policy should be\ncalibrated and adjusted based on how far the economy is from our goals. We are closer\n8\n\n\fto our goals than we have been in quite some time. The stance of monetary policy\nshould reflect such progress.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I remain positive about the U.S. economic outlook. Growth in the second\nand third quarters has rebounded, demonstrating that the effects of the wintry first\nquarter were indeed transitory. Thus, I expect growth will average about 3 percent for\nthe remainder of this year and in 2015, before settling back down to long-term growth\nlevels of about 2.4 percent.\nThe unemployment rate continues to improve more quickly than many had expected.\nWe are now approaching the rate that many policymakers view as a long-run\nsustainable value. Further, numerous labor market indicators continue to show broad\nimprovement and inflation is not appreciably below our 2 percent goal.\nBeginning to raise rates sooner rather than later reduces the chance that inflation will\naccelerate and, in so doing, require policy to become fairly aggressive with perhaps\nunsettling consequences. Waiting too long to begin raising rates — especially waiting\nuntil we have fully met our goals for maximum employment or attained our inflation\ntarget of 2 percent — is risky because doing so could put monetary policy behind the\ncurve. Such policies could lead to a return to abrupt go-stop policies, which in the past\nhave led to unwelcome volatility. Finally, delay is likely to increase the risk of\noverstaying our welcome at the zero bound, thus fostering unintended consequences\nfor financial stability.\nIf monetary policy is to be truly data dependent, then our stance of policy must change\nwith the data. Changing the forward guidance to provide greater clarity about the\npolicymakers’ reaction function would strengthen accountability and afford us the\nflexibility to gradually adjust rates as the economy evolves.\n\n9\n\n\f"

One month from\ntoday, on November 16, 2014, we will mark the 100th anniversary of the date when the\n12 Federal Reserve Banks, each independently chartered by Congress, first opened their\ndoors to begin serving our nation’s economy. That opening day in Philadelphia and in\nthe other 11 cities was the outcome of the Federal Reserve Act, which was signed into\nlaw by President Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913.\nWilson is credited with engineering a compromise that created our nation’s\ndecentralized central bank. To balance economic and geographic interests, Congress\ncreated a Federal Reserve System of regional Reserve Banks with oversight provided by\n1\n\n\fa Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This decentralized structure is one of our\ngreat strengths and mirrors the federalist framework of the nation. However, it requires\nthat I begin by reminding you that the views I express this morning are my own and do\nnot necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nSince we are so close to this centennial milestone, I thought I would begin with a little\nbackground about how the Fed works and how we are structured before I offer some\nthoughts on the economic outlook and monetary policy.\nExactly what are these nearly 100-year-old institutions? The Reserve Banks perform\nseveral roles. They distribute currency, act as a bankers’ bank, and serve as the bank for\nthe U.S. Treasury. They also play a critical role in supervising many banks and bank\nholding companies across the country. The 12 Reserve Banks also serve as the eyes and\nears of our central bank in assessing the economic pulse of Main Street as it formulates\nand implements monetary policy.\nEach Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors selected to represent a crosssection of banking, commercial, and community interests. These directors fulfill the\ntraditional governance role, but they also provide valuable insights into economic and\nfinancial conditions, which contribute to our assessment of the economy.\nThe Reserve Banks seek to stay in touch with Main Street in other ways. Some have\nBranch offices with their own boards, and all have a variety of advisory councils.\nThe Federal Reserve Banks also collect and analyze data about economic activity.\nHowever, published data are generally looking backward at the last month or the last\nquarter. So, the viewpoints we gather through our boards and advisory councils, and\nour outreach to businesses and communities through events like this help us add a real2\n\n\ftime perspective to the data and help us form a rich and detailed mosaic of our nation’s\neconomy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that considers this mosaic as it makes monetary\npolicy decisions is the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the System with a\nnumber of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the FOMC has included\nthe seven Governors in Washington, D.C., who are appointed by the President of the\nUnited States and confirmed by the Senate, as well as the president of the New York\nFed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents, who serve one-year terms as members on\na rotating basis. Philadelphia votes this year, but whether we vote or not, all Reserve\nBank presidents attend the FOMC meetings, participate in the discussions, and\ncontribute to the Committee’s assessment of the economy and the policy options.\nThe FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each year to set monetary policy. In\nnormal times, the Committee votes to adjust short-term interest rates to achieve the\ngoals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us. The goals for monetary policy are\narticulated in the Federal Reserve Act and specify that the FOMC “shall maintain long\nrun growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s\nlong run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of\nmaximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since\nmoderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable, many have\ninterpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to promote maximum\nsustainable employment and price stability.\nEconomic Conditions\nSo, with that background, let me turn to an overview of the U.S. economy as we enter\nthe fourth quarter of 2014. The economic expansion began more than five years ago in\nJune 2009. While the pace has been sluggish and uneven, I believe progress is\nundeniable. In fact, I remain optimistic about the prospects ahead.\n3\n\n\fThis year began with a harsh winter, which proved to be highly disruptive to the\neconomy. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the\nfirst quarter. But second-quarter GDP growth rebounded to 4.6 percent, according to\nthe most recent estimates. In the second quarter, the strongest recoveries were in\ncategories that were most directly affected by the first quarter’s severe weather,\nincluding investment in equipment, residential structures, inventory accumulation, and\nexports.\nPersonal consumption, the largest spending sector of the economy, slowed during the\nfirst quarter to 1.2 percent. After all, it is hard to go shopping when snow and ice keep\nyou from getting out of your house or driveway. In the second quarter, personal\nconsumption growth roughly doubled to 2.5 percent. Purchases of durable goods, such\nas automobiles, advanced at an annualized rate of 14.1 percent.\nI anticipate that consumer and business spending will help real GDP to grow at about 3\npercent for the remainder of this year and next before reverting to trend, which I see as\nabout 2.4 percent.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey has proven to be a\nreliable indicator of national manufacturing trends in the U.S. We will get October’s\nreading just after this meeting at 10 a.m., but September’s reading was the seventh\nconsecutive month in positive territory. The survey’s future activity indexes remained at\nhigh readings, suggesting continued optimism about manufacturing growth. In late\nSeptember, the Bank also officially launched a monthly Nonmanufacturing Business\nOutlook Survey, which we have been conducting since March 2011. The latest results\nfrom nonmanufacturing firms suggest continued expansion in the region.\nThe jobs report for September was also very strong, with employers adding 248,000 jobs\n4\n\n\fin the month nationwide. Additionally, the initial low estimate for August was revised\nupward, as was the estimate for July. These revisions added 69,000 more jobs. In all,\nemployers have added more than 2 million jobs thus far in 2014, at an average pace of\n227,000 per month through September.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent, marking its lowest level since July 2008 and\nwell below the 6.7 percent we experienced in December 2013. Even the broader U6\nmeasure, which includes discouraged workers and involuntary part-time workers,\ndropped to 11.8 percent, its lowest since October 2008 and down from 13.1 percent in\nDecember 2013.\nThe unemployment rate continues to fall faster than many policymakers had been\nforecasting. For instance, in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in\nDecember 2013, the central tendency of FOMC participants was an unemployment rate\nof 6.3 to 6.6 percent at the end of 2014, and by the end of 2015, the central tendency\nwas expected to be 5.8 to 6.1 percent. We have clearly exceeded these expectations.\nThe unemployment rate is now below where the Committee thought it would be at the\nend of 2014 and is now within the range expected at the end of 2015. Thus, it is fair to\nsay that we are at least a year ahead of where we thought we would be when we\nstarted to taper asset purchases. In fact, in September, the central tendency was\nlowered yet again to 5.9 from 6.0 percent for 2014 and to 5.4 from 5.6 percent by the\nend of 2015. We reached our year-end number for 2014 weeks later. How soon will we\nreach the year-end 2015 number?\nIn Pennsylvania, job growth has been positive as well. The state added more than\n47,000 jobs over the past 12 months. The August unemployment rate in Pennsylvania\nwas 5.8 percent, down 1.6 points from a year ago and down from a peak of 8.7 percent\nimmediately following the recession.\n\n5\n\n\fThis is not to claim that all is rosy in the labor markets. Many Americans remain\nfrustrated and disappointed in their jobs and job prospects. For example, a large\ncontingent of those working part time for economic reasons would like to be working\nfull time. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that significant progress has been\nmade.\nInflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, but it appears\nto be drifting upward. Headline inflation as measured by year-over-year change in the\nconsumer price index, or CPI, was 1.7 in August, down from 2 percent in July. That\nbroke a four-month streak of inflation at or above the 2 percent level. The Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In December 2013, inflation stood\nat 1.2 percent. The most recent reading for August 2014 was 1.5 percent. Compare\nthat with the December 2013 SEP estimates for 2014, and you will find that we are\ncurrently in line with the FOMC’s central tendency of 1.4 to 1.6 percent for PCE inflation.\nIn the September SEP, FOMC participants left their assessment of inflation unchanged\nwith a central tendency for PCE inflation by the fourth quarter of 2014 to between 1.5\nand 1.7 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters\nalso increased its average estimate of headline PCE inflation to 1.8 percent in 2014, up\nfrom 1.6 percent in the last survey. The survey also increased the estimate of PCE\ninflation to 2.0 percent in 2015, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous estimate.\nThe FOMC has stated that it expects the inflation rate to gradually rise to the 2 percent\ntarget, and I agree with that assessment.\nSince last year, the economy has moved closer to the Committee’s goals and has done\nso more quickly than anticipated. Yet, the stance of policy and its projected path\nprovided by the Committee have not changed.\n\n6\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nSo, let me turn to some thoughts on monetary policy, including why I departed from the\nmajority view at the July and September FOMC meetings.\nThe Fed has taken extraordinary monetary policy actions, keeping the federal funds rate\nnear zero for nearly six years and expanding its balance sheet to more than $4.5 trillion.\nYet, the recovery began over five years ago, and the unemployment rate has declined\nfrom 10 percent in October 2009 to 5.9 percent now. Whether you believe that the\nlabor market has fully recovered or not, it is clear that we have made considerable\nprogress toward full employment and price stability. We are no longer in the depths of\na financial crisis nor is the labor market in the same dire straits it was five years ago.\nIn its July and September statements, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative\nstance. The statements noted that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0\nto ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress\n— both realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2\npercent inflation.” In assessing this progress, the Committee reported that it will look at\na wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial\ndevelopments.\nThe FOMC also noted, based on its assessment of these factors, “that it likely will be\nappropriate to keep its target federal funds rate near zero for a considerable time after\nthe asset purchase program ends …”\nI objected to this forward guidance regarding the expected timing for raising the funds\nrate because I believe this language is no longer appropriate or warranted. Appropriate\nmonetary policy must respond to the data. I believe that by indicating that the FOMC\n7\n\n\fcontinues to anticipate that it will be a “considerable time” after the end of asset\npurchases before it is likely that the Committee will raise interest rates does not reflect\nthe significant progress made toward our goals. It also limits the Committee’s flexibility\nto take action going forward.\nWe have moved much closer to our goals since last December, and, accordingly, the\nstance of monetary policy should reflect such progress and begin to adjust gradually.\nThat is the essence of being data dependent. In the current context, we must\nacknowledge and thus prepare the markets for the fact that interest rates may begin to\nincrease sooner than previously anticipated. I felt that adjusting our language was the\nappropriate first step in responding to better-than-anticipated economic conditions.\nMy view is informed, as I have indicated, by realized and projected economic progress\ntoward our goals. But it is also influenced by guidance gained from the historical\nconduct of past monetary policy. In particular, my views on the appropriate funds rate\nsetting are — and continue to be — informed by Taylor-type monetary policy rules that\ndepict the past behavior of monetary policy in response to deviation from its desired\ninflation target and economic activity from its natural or efficient level. I find such rules\nuseful for benchmarking my policy prescriptions. These rules have been widely\ninvestigated and have been shown to be robust in that they deliver good results in a\nwide variety of models and circumstances.\nThe guidance I take from such robust rules is that we should no longer consider\nmonetary policy as being constrained by the zero lower bound. A variety of these rules,\nwhich I discussed in a speech earlier this summer, indicates that given the current\ninflation rate of just under our target of 2 percent and the current unemployment rate\nof 5.9 percent, the funds rate should be above zero or should be lifting off in the very\n\n8\n\n\fnear future. 1 In fact, maintaining a funds rate target near zero is unprecedented under\nsuch circumstances and as such could pose risks to the economy in the years ahead,\nincluding higher inflation and financial instability.\nI am not suggesting that rates should necessarily be increased now. Our first task is to\nchange the language in a way that allows for liftoff sooner than many now anticipate\nand sooner than suggested by our current guidance. Raising rates sooner rather than\nlater also reduces the chance that inflation will accelerate and require policy to become\nfairly aggressive with perhaps unsettling consequences. Thus, I believe that our forward\nguidance should be adjusted to reflect economic realities and to give us the flexibility to\nrespond sooner and more gradually to the evolution of the economy.\nThere is a point of view that rates cannot be raised because the labor market has not\ncompletely healed. That is, we must wait, maintaining our current stance of policy until\nwe have achieved our goals. I think this is a risky strategy for three reasons.\nFirst, we do not know how to confidently determine whether the labor market is fully\nhealed or when we have reached full employment. In January 2012, the FOMC affirmed\nin its statement of longer run goals and strategies that, “The maximum level of\nemployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. These factors, such as demographics or advancements in\ntechnology, may change over time and may not be directly measurable.” Chair Yellen\ngave an excellent speech at the Jackson Hole conference in August that highlighted\nsome of the structural and nonmonetary factors affecting the labor market. Economists\ndon’t fully understand how these factors may be influencing our efforts to assess the\nmeaning and measurement of full employment.\n\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club of\nNew York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014.\n\n9\n\n\fSecond, if we wait until we are certain that the labor market has fully recovered before\nbeginning to raise rates, policy will be far behind the curve. One risk of waiting is that\nthe Committee may be forced to raise rates very quickly to prevent an increase in\ninflation. In so doing, this may create unnecessary volatility and a rapid tightening of\nfinancial conditions — either of which could be disruptive to the economy.\nThis would represent a return of the so-called “go-stop” policies of the past. Such\nlanguage was used to describe episodes when the Fed was aggressively providing\nmonetary accommodation to stimulate employment and the economy — the go phase\n— only to find itself forced to apply the brakes abruptly to prevent a rapid uptick in\ninflation — the stop phase. This approach to policy led to more volatility and was more\ndisruptive than many found desirable.\nA third risk to waiting is that the zero interest rate policy has generated a very\naggressive reach for yield as investors take on either credit or duration risk to earn\nhigher returns. While the Fed is attempting to monitor such behavior, it is difficult to\nknow how or where the consequences of such actions may show up. It seems to me\nthat the law of unintended consequences looms large in this arena.\nFor these reasons, I would prefer that we start to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nThis may allow us to increase rates more gradually as the data improve rather than face\nthe prospect of a more abrupt increase in rates to catch up with market forces, which\ncould be the outcome of a prolonged delay in our willingness to act.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, I remain positive about the economic outlook. Second quarter growth\nhas rebounded after the disappointing first quarter caused by the harsh winter. At the\nend of this month, we will get the first look at the third quarter, which I expect will help\nus reach an average of about 3 percent for the remainder of this year and in 2015,\n10\n\n\fbefore settling back down to long-term growth levels of about 2.4 percent.\nThe unemployment rate continues to improve more quickly than many had expected.\nWe are now approaching the rate that many policymakers view as a long-run\nsustainable value. Inflation appears to be drifting up toward our 2 percent goal.\nRaising rates sooner rather than later reduces the chance that inflation will accelerate\nand, in so doing, require policy to become fairly aggressive with perhaps unsettling\nconsequences. Waiting too long to begin raising rates — especially waiting until we\nhave fully met our goals for maximum employment — is risky because we cannot know\nwhen we have arrived. That could also put monetary policy behind the curve and could\nlead to a return to abrupt go-stop policies that in the past have led to unwelcome\nvolatility. Finally, delay is likely to increase the risk of overstaying our welcome at the\nzero bound, thus fostering unintended consequences for financial stability.\nIf monetary policy is to be truly data dependent, then our stance of policy must begin to\nchange. I’m not suggesting a rate increase now, but changing the forward guidance\nwould at least afford us the flexibility to gradually raise rates beginning earlier than\ncurrently anticipated.\n\n11\n\n\f"

As you may know, this is the centennial year for the Federal Reserve. On December\n23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the act that created the Federal Reserve\nSystem, and on November 16, 1914, the 12 Reserve Banks officially opened their doors as\nindependently chartered banks. Oversight was assigned to a Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. That decentralized structure is one of our great strengths, but it requires that\nI begin by reminding you that the views I express this morning are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fSince this is a professional society of business editors and writers, I thought I would discuss the\nbenefits of clear communications as part of a systematic, rule-like approach to setting\nmonetary policy.\n\nDuring the past eight years, I have spoken and written frequently about ways to improve the\nframework we use for making monetary policy decisions. In my view, the monetary policy\nframework is most effective when the central bank:\n•\n\nCommits to a set of clearly articulated objectives that can be feasibly achieved by\nmonetary policy;\n\n•\n\nConducts monetary policy in a systematic or rule-like manner;\n\n•\n\nCommunicates its policies and actions to the public in a clear and transparent way;\nand\n\n•\n\nProtects its independence by maintaining a clear separation of monetary policy from\nfiscal policy.\n\nThese four principles are interrelated, and, as you will see, communication is a key ingredient\nfor a sound policy framework. To its credit, the Federal Reserve has sought to strengthen its\ncommunications and its monetary policy framework in recent years. I have described the\nprocess as like a journey, with each step contributing to a more informed public and a more\ntransparent central bank. While we have made strides over the past several decades, I also\nrecognize that the journey in recent years has taken us into unchartered territory.\nExtraordinary actions by the Fed in response to the Great Recession have presented unique\ncommunications challenges, which have made clarity more difficult. Yet, I believe we have\nnonetheless made progress.\n\nThe Journey Thus Far\nJust consider how far we have come. It was once taken for granted that the central bank was\nsupposed to be secretive and mysterious. The guiding principle was simple: The less said about\nmonetary policy, the better. Indeed, it was not until 1994 that the FOMC began to announce\n2\n\n\fpolicy changes made at its meetings. Before then, the markets were left to infer the policy\naction from the Fed’s behavior in the market.1 Since then, the FOMC has issued statements at\neach meeting, which include a vote tally, along with the views of dissenters. The FOMC now\nexpedites the release of the minutes, publishing them three weeks after each meeting. It also\nreports the economic projections of Committee participants four times a year. These meetings\nare followed by press conferences with the chair of the FOMC. In 2012, the FOMC issued a\nstatement clarifying our longer-run goals and strategy, including an explicit 2 percent target for\ninflation. And the economic projections now include information about the policy path\nassumptions of participants.\n\nThese last two initiatives were based on the recommendations of a subcommittee on\ncommunications led by then Vice Chair Yellen, which included President Evans of Chicago,\nformer Governor Raskin, and myself. This summer, Chair Yellen asked Vice Chair Fischer to lead\na new subcommittee on communications, with Governor Powell, President Williams of San\nFrancisco, and President Mester of Cleveland, to continue to find ways to improve\ncommunications.\n\nClearly Articulating Objectives\nLet’s consider how communications support each of the four principles of sound central\nbanking, beginning with clearly articulating the objectives of monetary policy. But before doing\nso, it is useful to spell out exactly what the FOMC is supposed to do. The Federal Reserve Act\nspecifies the Fed “shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates\ncommensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote\neffectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest\nrates.” Since moderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable, many\nhave interpreted these goals as a dual mandate to manage fluctuations in employment in the\nshort run while preserving price stability in the long run.\n1\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, “Timeline to Transparency,” www.philadelphiafed.org/about-thefed/transparency/ (accessed October 9, 2014).\n\n3\n\n\fHowever, most economists are dubious of the ability of monetary policy to predictably and\nprecisely control employment in the short run, and there is a strong consensus that monetary\npolicy cannot determine employment in the long run. As the FOMC noted in its statement on\nlonger-run goals adopted in 2012, the maximum level of employment is largely determined by\nnonmonetary factors, such as changing demographics, which affect the structure and dynamics\nof the labor market.\n\nIn my view, excessive focus on short-run control of employment weakens the credibility and\neffectiveness of the Fed in achieving its price stability objective. We learned this lesson most\ndramatically during the 1970s when, despite the extensive efforts to reduce unemployment,\nthe Fed essentially failed, and the nation experienced a prolonged period of high\nunemployment and high inflation. The economy paid the price in the form of a deep recession,\nas the Fed sought to restore the credibility of its commitment to price stability.\n\nWhen establishing the longer-term goals and objectives for any organization, and particularly\none that serves the public, it is important that the goals be achievable. Assigning unachievable\ngoals to organizations is a recipe for failure. For the Fed, it could mean a loss of public\nconfidence. I fear that the public has come to expect too much from its central bank and too\nmuch from monetary policy, in particular. We need to heed the words of Nobel Prize winner,\nMilton Friedman. In his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association, he\nsaid, “we are in danger of assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform, in\ndanger of asking it to accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and as a result, in danger of\npreventing it from making the contribution that it is capable of making.”2\n\nIn my view, the dual mandate has contributed to a view that monetary policy can accomplish\nfar more than it is, perhaps, capable of achieving. Even though the FOMC’s 2012 statement of\n2\n\nSee Milton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, 58:1 (March 1968), pp. 1–17.\n\n4\n\n\fobjectives acknowledged that it is inappropriate to set a fixed goal for employment and that\nmaximum employment is influenced by many factors, the FOMC’s recent policy statements\nhave increasingly given the impression that it wants to achieve an employment goal as quickly\nas possible through aggressive monetary accommodation.\n\nI believe that assigning multiple objectives for the central bank opens the door to highly\ndiscretionary policies, which can be justified by shifting the focus or rationale for action from\ngoal to goal. That is why I have argued that Congress ought to redefine the Fed’s monetary\npolicy goals to focus solely, or at least primarily, on price stability. I base this on two facts:\nMonetary policy has a very limited ability to influence real variables, such as employment. And,\nin a regime with fiat currency, only the central bank can ensure price stability. Indeed, it is the\none goal that the central bank can achieve over the longer run.\n\nSetting clear, achievable objectives is part of the framework. Asking policymakers to pursue\nthose objectives in a systematic, rule-like approach is the second key principle.\n\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nSo, what do I mean by a systematic approach to policy? Quite simply, I mean conducting policy\nin a more rule-like manner. It is difficult for policymakers to choose a systematic rule-like\napproach that would tie their hands and thus limit their discretionary ability. Yet, economists\nhave long been aware of the benefits of rule-like behavior. Dating as far back as 1936, Henry\nSimons discussed how rule-like behavior is preferable to pure discretion.3 More recently, Finn\nKydland and Ed Prescott in their Nobel Prize-winning work showed that a credible commitment\nby policymakers to behave in a systematic rule-like manner leads to better outcomes than\ndiscretion.4 Since then, numerous papers using a variety of models have investigated the\nbenefits of rule-like behavior in monetary policy and found that there are indeed significant\n3\n\nHenry C. Simons, “Rules Versus Authorities in Monetary Policy,” Journal of Political Economy, 44:1 (February\n1936).\n4\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–491.\n\n5\n\n\fbenefits.\n\nOne of the reasons that rules work better than discretion is that they are transparent and\ntherefore allow for simpler and more effective communication of policy decisions. Moreover, a\nlarge body of research over the last 40 years has emphasized the important role expectations\nplay in determining economic outcomes. That means more effective communication of the\ndecision-making process leads to more accurate expectations. When policy is set\nsystematically, the public and financial market participants can form more accurate\nexpectations about policy. Policy is then less of a source of instability or uncertainty.\n\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic, or rule-like, is to base policy decisions on\nobservable economic conditions. That is, policymakers should describe the reaction function\nthat determines how the current and future policy rate will be set depending on economic\ndata. I want to emphasize that a reaction function does not mean a timetable or a threshold\nfor action. Monetary policy should be data dependent, not date dependent. And the use of\nthat data must recognize that policymakers are no more certain about future economic\nconditions than anyone else is. Thus, the future path of policy will always be highly uncertain.\nHowever, a reaction function should explain how the policy rate will be determined in the\nfuture as a function of economic conditions.\n\nI also want to clear up some confusion about whether a reaction function is somehow\nmechanical. The science of monetary policy has not reached the point where we can specify a\nsingle optimal rule for setting policy and turn decision-making over to a computer. Judgment is\nstill required. Because we do not know the true model of the economy, I would suggest the\nFOMC begin by considering and reporting on a set of robust policy rules designed to have good\nresults in a variety of models and across various stages of the business cycle. Such robust rules\nrecognize that data are measured imprecisely and are subject to revision.\n\nBy considering such robust rules, the FOMC might be able to move toward a consensus on a\n6\n\n\fqualitative description of its reaction function as an important first step. For example, we\nwould not have to specify the precise mathematical rule but would provide assessments of key\nvariables and then communicate our policy decisions in terms of changes in these key variables.\nIf policy were changed, then we would explain that change in terms of how the variables in our\nresponse function changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically use\nthem to describe our policy choices, then the public will form more accurate judgments about\nthe likely course of policy. That will reduce uncertainty, promote stability, and lead to greater\ntransparency.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\nAs I mentioned at the outset, communications has been the subject of considerable discussion\nin recent years. It took on heightened importance as the FOMC responded to the financial crisis\nand recession. Since December 2008, the federal funds rate target has been near zero. Since\nthe nominal federal funds rate cannot go below zero, we had to develop alternative policy tools\nin an effort to provide further accommodation to support the recovery, such as the large-scale\nasset purchase program. We also had to figure out how and what to communicate about these\nnew tools. The asset purchase program has had many dimensions, such as the overall volume\nof purchases, the pace of purchases, the kind of assets targeted for purchase, and the criteria\nfor starting and stopping the purchases. Policymakers have tried to fine-tune the program\nalong each dimension while assessing the tradeoffs among them and the tradeoffs with other\npolicy tools, such as the traditional funds rate decision. With so many moving parts to our\npolicy framework, it is not surprising that communication is very complicated and challenging.\n\nThe task was further complicated because one of the unconventional measures employed by\nthe FOMC was so-called forward guidance. Forward guidance is the central banker’s term for\ncommunications about the future path of policy. One way to think of forward guidance is that\nit is just another step toward increased transparency and effective communication of monetary\npolicy. However, another rationale for forward guidance is that it is a way of increasing\naccommodation in a period when the policy rate is at or near the zero lower bound. Some\n7\n\n\fmodels suggest that when you are at the zero lower bound, it can be desirable, or optimal, to\nindicate that future policy rates will be kept “lower for longer” than might otherwise be the\ncase. In this approach, such a commitment would tend to raise inflation expectations and\nlower long-term nominal rates, thereby inducing households and businesses to spend more\ntoday.\n\nThis approach asks more of forward guidance than just articulating a reaction function. It takes\nmore credibility and commitment because it requires policymakers to directly influence and\nmanage the public’s beliefs about the future policy path in ways that are different from how\nthey may have behaved in the past. As I have indicated in previous speeches, this approach to\nforward guidance can backfire if the policy is misunderstood.5 For example, if the public hears\nthat the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret this news as policymakers saying\nthat they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If the message is interpreted in that\nway, then the forward guidance will not succeed and may even weaken current spending.\n\nI believe we should think of forward guidance as part of systematic approach to decisionmaking and not an independent policy tool that attempts to bend expectations. As monetary\npolicy becomes normalized, we have the opportunity to ensure the public understands that\nforward guidance is an integrated part of a systematic approach to policy.\n\nSo, what additional steps can we take to increase transparency? I think that the FOMC could\nimprove communication and transparency by preparing a more comprehensive monetary\npolicy report on a regular basis, perhaps quarterly. Currently, the Chair testifies before\nCongress twice a year and submits an accompanying written report. In addition, the Chair\nholds press briefings four times a year when participants present their economic projections. I\nthink there is an opportunity to combine these efforts into a more comprehensive report on\nmonetary policy as many other countries do. The report would offer an opportunity to\n5\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research’s\n(SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA.\n\n8\n\n\freinforce the underlying policy framework and how it relates to current and expected economic\nconditions. Ideally, this report would incorporate a discussion of robust systematic rules I\nreferred to a moment ago. Such a discussion would provide the opportunity to inform the\npublic about the expected future path of policy conditioned on how the economy evolves.\n\nPublishing a monetary policy report with an assessment of the likely near-term path of policy\nrates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, would also provide added discipline for\npolicymakers to stick to a systematic, rule-like approach. Providing information about how that\npath is likely to evolve forces policymakers to think more deeply and systematically about\npolicy. Communication about that path, in turn, gives the public a much deeper understanding\nof the analytical approach that guides monetary policy.\n\nWhile I am discussing transparency, I also want to touch on another misconception. Some\ncommentators express the view that dissent causes dissonance and therefore confuses the\ncommunications. In fact, letting the public know about our debates and differing views is more\ntransparent than hiding behind false consensus.\n\nMonetary policymaking is conducted by committee, and divergent views can and often do exist.\nWhile this can be clumsy at times, such governance mechanisms have great strength in\npreventing institutions from lapsing into groupthink by ensuring that various views are heard in\nan environment that promotes better decisions and outcomes, and they help to preserve the\ncentral bank’s independence and accountability.\n\nOpen dialogue and diversity of views leads to better policy decisions and is the primary means\nby which new ideas are gradually incorporated into our monetary policy framework. Thus, I\nbelieve diversity of thought is a sign of thoughtful progress. I have often quoted the famous\nAmerican journalist Walter Lippmann who said, “Where all men think alike, no one thinks very\nmuch.” I think it is healthy for the American public to know that we debate some of the same\nissues that those outside the Fed debate. Hiding such debate behind a unanimous vote does\n9\n\n\fnothing to promote true transparency.\n\nPreserving Independence\nFinally, I believe that the fundamental concept of a decentralized central bank has great merit,\nin part, because it helps to preserve the independence and maintain the public trust in the\ninstitution. Independence is essential if a central bank is to play its fundamental role in\npreserving the purchasing power of a fiat currency. History is replete with examples of\ngovernments using the power to print money as a substitute for making tough fiscal choices,\nand the results are almost always disastrous.\n\nCentral bank independence is a fundamental tenet of sound central banking and leads to better\neconomic outcomes. But independence must be accompanied by accountability. And\naccountability is more easily achieved when there is transparency. The public can best hold a\ncentral bank accountable when its goals are clearly stated and achievable.\n\nTransparent and clear communications of monetary policy goals and a decision-making\nframework help ensure accountability and preserve central bank independence. Transparency\ncan also enhance a central bank’s credibility. A central bank that is transparent will be less\nwilling to make promises it cannot keep. When policy pronouncements are more credible,\npolicy is more effective. Transparency can also make it easier to explain changes in policy\nwithout damaging the central bank’s credibility.\n\nConclusion\nTo summarize, the FOMC is on a journey to improve communications and the transparency of\nits monetary policy decision-making process. The benefits of transparency are now accepted by\npolicymakers across the globe. Transparency not only improves the effectiveness of monetary\npolicy, it also improves the central bank’s credibility and accountability with the public. The\nFOMC’s recent moves to publish guidelines on its longer-run goals and policy strategy and the\npolicy assumptions that underlie FOMC projections are great strides toward this goal.\n10\n\n\fHowever, more can be done.\n\nIn particular, I believe the FOMC should continue to work toward increasing the public\nunderstanding of how policy will react systematically to changes in economic conditions. I\nbelieve the FOMC should move forward to describe a reaction function and then communicate\nour actions and decisions in terms of this reaction function. A detailed monetary policy report\ncould be a useful vehicle for such enhanced communication.\n\nBecause systematic policy is easily communicated to the public, it will improve the transparency\nand predictability of monetary policy, which reduces policy surprises. Businesses and\nconsumers are more informed about the course of monetary policy because they understand\nhow policymakers are likely to react to changing economic circumstances even if they are not\ncertain what those economic conditions might be. Equally important in my view is that greater\nclarity about policymakers’ reaction function strengthens accountability. Thus, systematic\npolicy, communicated transparently, strengthens accountability and serves to preserve the\ncentral bank’s independence.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Thank you for the opportunity to speak at this 137th annual convention\nof the Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers. Community banks have a long\nand venerable history in our nation, and the 137 years of the PACB is a powerful\ntestament to your roots as stalwarts in our financial system. I would note that the\nlongevity of this convention means that your organization significantly predates the\n1\n\n\fFederal Reserve System, which is observing its centennial this year. My suspicion is that\nthere are a number of community bankers here today who can trace their corporate\nhistories to firms that petitioned for the establishment of a Federal Reserve Bank in\nPhiladelphia 100 years ago. I actually have two letters here. One from the New Tripoli\nNational Bank dated December 27, 1913, and one from the First National Bank of\nMifflintown dated December 26, 1913, both addressed to William McAdoo, Secretary of\nthe Treasury, requesting the establishment of a Federal Reserve Bank in the City of\nPhiladelphia.\nOver the years, community banking organizations, whether they are state member\nbanks or not, have provided important links between the Federal Reserve Banks and the\nbusinesses and communities your institutions serve. We have reached out and listened\nto community bankers through their representation on our boards of directors and\nadvisory councils, as well as through our ongoing contacts with individual firms and the\nbusiness organizations you serve.\nThe insights we gather from community bankers in our District help me as a policymaker\nbring Main Street perspectives to the national policy table each time the Federal Open\nMarket Committee, or FOMC, meets in Washington. When such information from all\nthe Districts comes together at our meetings, it forms a rich mosaic of our economy that\nhelps shape our monetary policy decisions.\nSo, I want to thank Nick DiFrancesco, president and CEO of the PACB, and Dennis\nCirucci, your chairman, for inviting me here today. I also want to publicly thank Dennis\nfor serving so ably on our Bank’s Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, or\nCDIAC, and as our council’s representative to the Board of Governors.\nMy last opportunity to address the PACB was in September 2007, a very different\neconomic environment than we find ourselves in today. I used that speech seven years\nago to discuss the Federal Reserve’s initial responses to growing financial instability in\nthe housing sector. I explained that the Fed’s role in promoting financial stability rather\n2\n\n\fthan its monetary policy responsibilities had prompted the short-term injection of some\n$68 billion in liquidity through open market operations in early August 2007, a mere 12\nmonths after I joined the Fed. That seems like a long time ago and much has transpired\nsince then. At the time, the FOMC had yet to lower the federal funds rate from its\ntarget of 5.25 percent. Weeks later, though, the FOMC began to lower the federal funds\nrate target and then kept lowering it to essentially zero in December 2008, as the global\nfinancial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession enveloped economies around the world.\nThe rate has been near zero for nearly six years now, and the Fed has augmented its\naggressive policy actions through large-scale asset purchases, now tallying in the\ntrillions, rather than in the billions of dollars.\nToday, I would like to give you my assessment of the U.S. economy and then share some\nthoughts about the stance of monetary policy.\nI should note that my views are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\nReserve Board or my colleagues on the FOMC, which will shortly become apparent.\nEconomic Conditions\nSo, let me begin with an overview of the U.S. economy. We are more than five years\ninto a recovery that began in June 2009. While the pace has been sluggish and uneven, I\nbelieve the progress is undeniable. In fact, despite a winter cold spell in the first\nquarter, I remain mostly positive about the prospects ahead.\nThe severe winter led to a decline in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first\nquarter of the year, but second-quarter growth rebounded to 4.2 percent, according to\nthe most recent estimate. This largely confirmed that the disappointing performance in\nthe first quarter was mostly a temporary weather-related slowdown rather than a more\npersistent retrenchment in the ongoing recovery. In the second quarter, the strongest\nrecoveries were in categories most directly affected by the first quarter’s severe\nweather, including investment in equipment, residential structures, inventory\n3\n\n\faccumulation, and exports. Exports declined sharply at an annual rate of 10.1 percent in\nthe first quarter and then jumped 9.5 percent in the second. Total private domestic\ninvestment fell 6.9 percent in the first-quarter freeze but then grew 17.5 percent during\nthe second-quarter thaw.\nPersonal consumption, the largest spending sector of the economy, slowed during the\nfirst quarter to 1.2 percent. In the second quarter, personal consumption growth\napproximately doubled to 2.5 percent. Durable goods, which advanced at an annualized\nrate of 14 percent, were the strongest component of personal consumption in the\nsecond quarter.\nI believe consumer and business spending will help real GDP to grow at about 3 percent\nfor the remainder of this year and next before reverting to trend, which I see as about\n2.4 percent.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey in our region has proven\nto be a reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends in the U.S. In August, the\ndiffusion index of current activity increased for the third consecutive month and had its\nstrongest reading since March 2011. The survey also indicated that expectations for\nmanufacturing activity six months ahead remained strong. Underlying details of the\nreport included strong results for new orders and shipments. The current indicators for\nlabor conditions also suggested continued expansion in employment. The employment\nindex has been positive for 14 months, and the workweek index was positive for the\nsixth month.\nThese data suggest continued improvement in U.S. labor market conditions, despite a\nsomewhat softer August number yesterday, which showed that 142,000 jobs were\nadded to nonfarm U.S. payrolls. However, I prefer to look at longer-term trends rather\nthan monthly numbers that are still subject to revision. Year-to-date monthly average\njob growth has amounted to 215,000 jobs this year, compared with a monthly average\nof 194,000 jobs added last year.\n4\n\n\fDespite the slowdown in August, job creation has improved markedly this year. The\neconomy has created 1.7 million jobs since the start of the year, nearly 10 percent more\nthan the same period in 2013, 20 percent more than in 2012, and 30 percent more than\nin 2011.\nThe unemployment rate was 6.1 percent in August, down more than a full percentage\npoint from a year ago. This means the unemployment rate continues to fall faster than\nmany policymakers had been forecasting. For instance, in the Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP) submitted in December 2013, the central tendency of FOMC\nparticipants was to end 2014 with an unemployment rate of 6.3 to 6.6 percent, and by\nthe end of 2015, the central tendency was expected to be 5.8 to 6.1 percent. We have\nclearly exceeded expectations. The unemployment rate is below where the Committee\nthought it would be at the end of 2014 and is now within the range expected at the end\nof 2015. Thus, it is fair to say that we are at least a year ahead of where we thought we\nwould be when we started to taper asset purchases.\nIn Pennsylvania, job growth has been positive as well. The state added more than\n54,000 jobs over the past 12 months. July’s unemployment rate in Pennsylvania was 5.7\npercent, down from 7.5 percent a year ago and from a peak of 8.7 percent immediately\nfollowing the recession.\nIt is not just that the unemployment rate has fallen, other measures of labor market\nconditions have improved as well. Long-term unemployment in the nation, those\nunemployed for more than 27 weeks, has dropped by about 1.3 million from a year ago;\nthe duration of unemployment spells has declined; job openings have returned to prerecession levels; and the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs, called the\nquit rate, has risen.\nThis is not to claim that all is rosy in the labor markets. Many Americans remain\nfrustrated and disappointed in their jobs and job prospects. For example, there remains\na large contingent of those working part time for reasons economists don’t fully\n5\n\n\funderstand. Nonetheless, we have to acknowledge that significant progress has been\nmade.\nInflation remains somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent, but it appears\nto be drifting upward. Headline inflation as measured by year-over-year change in the\nconsumer price index, or CPI, was 2 percent in July, the fourth month at or above that\nlevel. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price\nindex for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. In December of last\nyear, that figure stood at 1.2 percent. The most recent reading for July 2014 was 1.6\npercent. Compare that with December 2013 SEP estimates for 2014, and you will find\nthat we are already at the top of the FOMC’s central tendency of 1.4 to 1.6 percent for\nPCE inflation.\nIn the June SEP, FOMC participants modestly increased their assessment of inflation,\nraising the central tendency for PCE inflation by the fourth quarter of 2014 to between\n1.5 and 1.7 percent. The Philadelphia Fed’s most recent Survey of Professional\nForecasters also increased its average estimate of headline PCE inflation to 1.8 percent\nin 2014, up from 1.6 percent in the last survey. The survey also increased the estimate\nof PCE inflation to 2.0 percent in 2015, up 0.1 percentage point from the previous\nestimate. All of these figures suggest that inflation appears to be gradually moving\ncloser to our target of 2 percent and doing so more quickly than anticipated in\nDecember 2013.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me turn to some thoughts on monetary policy, including why I departed from the\nmajority view at the July FOMC meeting.\nAs I noted in the beginning of my remarks, the Fed has taken extraordinary monetary\npolicy actions, keeping the federal funds rate near zero for nearly six years and\nexpanding its balance sheet to more than $4 trillion. Indeed, the balance sheet\n\n6\n\n\fcontinues to expand, so the Fed is still trying to increase accommodation even though\nthe pace of purchases is slowing and is expected to end in October.\nYet, the recovery began over five years ago, and the unemployment rate has declined\nfrom 10 percent in October 2009, to 6.1 percent now. Whether you believe that the\nlabor market has fully recovered or not, it is clear that we have made considerable\nprogress toward full employment and price stability. We are no longer in the depths of\na financial crisis nor is the labor market in the same dire straits it was five years ago.\nIn its July statement, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative stance. The\nstatement noted that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent\ntarget range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress — both\nrealized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent\ninflation.” In assessing this progress, the Committee reported that it will look at a wide\nrange of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of\ninflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\nThe FOMC also noted, based on its assessment of these factors, “that it likely will be\nappropriate to keep its target federal funds rate near zero for a considerable time after\nthe asset purchase program ends …”\nI objected to this forward guidance regarding the expected timing for raising the funds\nrate because I believe this language is no longer appropriate or warranted. Appropriate\nmonetary policy must respond to the data. I believe that by indicating that the FOMC\ncontinues to anticipate that it will be a “considerable time” after the end of\nasset purchases before it is likely that the Committee will raise interest rates does not\nreflect the significant progress toward our goals. It also limits the Committee’s flexibility\nto take action going forward.\nWe have moved much closer to our goals since last December, and, as we do so, the\nstance of monetary policy should reflect such progress and begin to gradually adjust.\nThat is the essence of being data dependent. In the current context, we must\n7\n\n\facknowledge and thus prepare the markets for the fact that interest rates may begin to\nincrease sooner than previously anticipated. I felt that adjusting our language was the\nappropriate first step in responding to better-than-anticipated economic conditions.\nMy view is informed, as I have indicated, by realized and projected economic progress\ntoward our goals. But it is also influenced by guidance gained from the historical\nconduct of past monetary policy. In particular, my views on the appropriate funds rate\nsetting are — and continue to be — informed by Taylor-type monetary policy rules that\ndepict the past behavior of monetary policy. I find such rules useful for benchmarking\nmy policy prescriptions. These rules have been widely investigated and have been\nshown to be robust, in that they deliver good results in a wide variety of models and\ncircumstances.\nThe guidance I take from such robust rules is that we should no longer consider\nmonetary policy as being constrained by the zero lower bound. A variety of these rules,\nwhich I discussed in a speech earlier this summer, indicates that under current\nconditions the funds rate should already be above zero or should be lifting off in the\nvery near future. 1 I am not suggesting that rates should necessarily be increased now.\nOur first task is to change the language in a way that allows for liftoff sooner than many\nnow anticipate and sooner than suggested by our current guidance. Raising rates\nsooner rather than later also reduces the chance that inflation will accelerate and, in so\ndoing, require policy to become fairly aggressive with perhaps unsettling consequences.\nThus, I believe that our forward guidance should be adjusted to reflect economic\nrealities and to give us the flexibility to respond sooner and more gradually to the\nevolution of the economy.\nThere is a point of view that rates cannot be raised because the labor market has not\ncompletely healed. That is, we must wait, maintaining our current stance of policy until\nwe have achieved our goals. I think this is a risky strategy for two reasons.\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Systematic Monetary Policy and Communication,” remarks to the Economic Club of\nNew York, New York, NY, June 24, 2014.\n\n8\n\n\fFirst, we do not know how to confidently determine whether the labor market is fully\nhealed or when we have reached full employment. In January 2012, the FOMC affirmed\nin its statement of longer run goals and strategies that, “The maximum level of\nemployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and\ndynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be\ndirectly measurable.” Chair Yellen gave an excellent speech at the Jackson Hole\nconference just a couple of weeks ago that highlighted some of the structural and\nnonmonetary factors affecting the labor market. Economists don’t fully understand\nhow these factors may be influencing our efforts to assess the meaning and\nmeasurement of full employment.\nSecond, if monetary policy waits until it is certain that the labor market has fully\nrecovered before beginning to raise rates, policy will be far behind the curve. One risk\nof waiting is that the Committee may be forced to raise rates very quickly to prevent an\nincrease in inflation. In so doing, this may create unnecessary volatility and a rapid\ntightening of financial conditions — either of which could be disruptive to the economy.\nThis would represent a return of the so-called “go-stop” policies of the past. Such\nlanguage was used to describe episodes when the Fed was viewed as providing lots of\naccommodation to stimulate employment and the economy — the go phase — only to\nfind itself forced to apply the brakes abruptly to prevent a rapid uptick in inflation — the\nstop phase. This approach to policy led to more volatility and was more disruptive than\nmany found desirable.\nFor these reasons, I would prefer that we start to raise rates sooner rather than later.\nThis may allow us to increase rates more gradually as the data improve rather than face\nthe prospect of a more abrupt increase in rates to catch up with market forces, which\ncould be the outcome of a prolonged delay in our willingness to act.\n\n9\n\n\fConclusion\nTo summarize, my own forecast is positive. Second-quarter growth has rebounded,\nconfirming that the disappointing performance in the first quarter was mostly weather\nrelated rather than a retrenchment to the ongoing recovery.\nUnemployment continues to improve more quickly than many had expected, and\ninflation appears to be drifting up toward our 2 percent goal.\nIf monetary policy is to be truly data dependent, then our stance of policy must begin to\nchange. I’m not suggesting a rate increase now, but changing the forward guidance\nwould at least afford us the flexibility to gradually raise rates beginning earlier than\ncurrently anticipated.\nWaiting too long to begin raising rates — especially waiting until we have fully met our\ngoals for maximum employment — is risky because we cannot know when we have\narrived. That could also put monetary policy behind the curve and could lead to a\nreturn to abrupt go-stop policies that in the past led to unwelcome volatility.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\n•\n\nPresident Plosser gives his views on the economy and the FOMC’s most recent policy\ndecisions.

You have continued to deliver the great\nprograms and speakers that so many have come to expect from the club. As many of\nyou know, this is the centennial year for the Federal Reserve. In the spirit of such an\nanniversary, my hat goes off to The Economic Club of New York, which has been around\nfor 107 years. What a great and storied history you have, and it is an honor to be here.\nI should note that Congress created our decentralized central bank 100 years ago. That\ndecentralized structure is one of our great strengths, but it requires that I begin with the\nusual disclaimer that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC).\n\n\fIn my remarks this morning, I want to discuss the benefits of rule-like, systematic\nbehavior in the design and conduct of monetary policy. Such behavior, combined with\ngreater transparency, leads to communication that is more effective. This, in turn, helps\nthe public understand the FOMC’s strategies, individual policy decisions, and the likely\npath of policy.\nI will go one step further and illustrate how the FOMC might take a step toward a more\nsystematic policy framework by producing a detailed monetary policy report, similar to\nthose issued by many central banks around the world. One aspect of such a report\ncould highlight the policy paths implied by a few Taylor-like or robust rules and use\nthem as benchmarks to set and communicate policy in a more systematic, rule-like way.\nI will begin with a brief overview of my thoughts about the economy and the FOMC’s\nmost recent policy decisions before I discuss the role that systematic policy can play in\nthe communication of policy.\nThe Economy and the Recent Policy Decision\nFirst, the economy. My overall view of the economy is fairly optimistic. After a first\nquarter buffeted by winter storms, I believe we are poised to grow at a rate somewhat\nabove trend for the remainder of this year and next before reverting back to trend,\nwhich I see as about 2.4 percent. Steady employment growth and healthier household\nbalance sheets will support consumption activity. The current data suggest economic\nstrength is fairly broad based, as evidenced by recent indicators and the optimism\nexpressed by firms in both the manufacturing and service sectors.\nAs for inflation, recent readings have moved a bit higher, mitigating somewhat the\nconcerns that low inflation will persist or decline further. We have ample monetary\naccommodation in the economy to ensure that we will be able to achieve our 2 percent\ntarget over time. It is important, however, that we continue to reinforce our\n2\n\n\fcommitment to that goal so that inflation expectations remain well anchored near our\ntarget.\nAt the meeting last week, the FOMC released its latest Summary of Economic\nProjections (SEP). The outlook going forward was largely unchanged. While real GDP\ngrowth for 2014 was marked down, which reflected the disappointing first quarter, the\noutlook for the second half of the year and the projections for 2015 and 2016 were\nunchanged. Unemployment projections were reduced slightly, and the inflation\nforecast remained stable.\nMy own submission for economic growth was generally in line with my colleagues. But\nmy forecast for unemployment was a bit lower in the near term. Specifically, I think the\nunemployment rate may reach 5.8 percent by the end of this year and 5.6 percent by\nthe end of 2015. My view of inflation is that it will stabilize at about 2 percent in 2015.\nSome market participants and commentators have focused on the so-called dot charts\nand the movement of the implied median funds rate for 2014–16. I would remind\neveryone that the dots are not a forecast of what policymakers think the Committee will\nactually do, but they are a reflection of the policymakers’ views of appropriate policy.\nSome have noted that the median path steepened ever so slightly. This should not\ncome as a particular surprise as it likely just reveals greater confidence that the\neconomy is improving. The rebound after the bad winter seems to be progressing, the\noutlook for unemployment is a bit better, and the inflation rate appears to be firming.\nThe changes in the dots thus simply tell us something about individual policymakers\nreaction to the change in economic conditions. The FOMC statement notes that the\nCommittee will adjust future funds rate decisions based on the progress toward our\nobjectives. So, it is entirely reasonable that the expected path of “appropriate policy”\nshould adjust as we close in on those objectives. Indeed, it would be surprising if they\ndid not behave in such a manner.\n3\n\n\fI believe that we are closing in on our goals — perhaps faster than some people might\nthink. So, while I supported the recent policy statement, I have growing concerns that\nwe may have to adjust our communications in the not-too-distant future. Specifically, I\nbelieve the forward guidance in the statement may be too passive, given underlying\neconomic conditions.\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nLet me now turn to the importance of conducting monetary policy in a systematic\nmanner. By systematic policy, I mean conducting policy in a rule-like manner as\nopposed to relying on discretion. Decisions are always made period by period, but in a\nrules-based approach, the decisions are guided by the rules. Discretion is the opposite\nof rules-based decisionmaking. Discretionary decisions are made without being\nconstrained by past promises or previous forward-looking statements.\nThe monetary policy debate over whether rule-like behavior is preferable to pure\ndiscretion dates back at least to Henry Simons in 1936.1 More recently, in their Nobel\nPrize-winning work, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott demonstrated that a credible\ncommitment by policymakers to behave in a systematic rule-like manner leads to better\noutcomes than discretion. 2 Since then, numerous papers using a variety of models have\ninvestigated the benefits of rule-like behavior in monetary policy and found that there\nare indeed significant benefits. Policies characterized by commitment have been shown\nto lead to more economic stability. In fact, the mainstream theoretical models that we\nuse for monetary and macroeconomic analysis are built on the notion that monetary\npolicy is conducted in a rule-like manner.\n\n1\n\nHenry C. Simons, “Rules Versus Authorities in Monetary Policy,” Journal of Political Economy, 44:1\n(February 1936).\n2\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal\nPlans,” Journal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n4\n\n\fThe benefits of a rule-like approach arise, in part, because consumers and businesses\nare forward looking. When policymakers credibly commit to a rule-like approach to\nsetting policy, they can alter expectations in ways that make policy more effective and\nless uncertain.\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic, or rule-like, is to base policy decisions\non the state of the economy. That is, policymakers should describe the reaction\nfunction that determines how the current and future policy rate will be set depending\non economic conditions. Policymakers are, of course, no more certain about future\ncourse of the economy than anyone else is; therefore, they cannot realistically commit\nto particular future values of the policy rate. Nonetheless, describing a reaction\nfunction or rule that explains how the policy rate will be determined in the future as a\nfunction of economic conditions can be highly informative.\nUnfortunately, the science of monetary policy has not progressed to the point where we\ncan specify the optimal rule for setting monetary policy. Given our current state of\nknowledge, judgment is still required in setting policy. One reason is that optimal rules,\nthat is, those that maximize economic welfare, are highly dependent on the particular\nmodel from which they are derived, and there is no broad-based consensus for the right\nmodel. Another factor is that the optimal rule for one model can produce very bad\noutcomes in another model. A third reason is that optimal rules can often be quite\ncomplex, thus making them difficult to implement and to communicate to the public. In\nother words, they may not be very transparent.\nHowever, these limitations to implementing optimal policy rules should not deter us\nfrom efforts to adopt a more systematic, rule-like approach to the conduct of policy.\nIndeed, there has been a great deal of progress made in identifying simple, robust rules\n\n5\n\n\fthat appear to perform well in a variety of models and environments. The most wellknown rule is attributable to John Taylor. 3 The Taylor rule is a reaction function that\nindicates how to set the policy rate as a function of deviations of inflation from the\ninflation target and some measure of economic slack.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules goes beyond their intuitive appeal or the fact that\nthey seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The\nreality is that Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical models.\nWhile this is surprising to some, it is of enormous practical importance. Given our\nuncertainty about the true model of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in the\nform of a Taylor-like rule delivers good outcomes in a variety of models means that\nthese simple, robust rules can provide useful guidance for policy. Moreover, rule-like\npolicies also play an important role in central bank communication.\nCommunication\nThe fundamental reason that communication is so important is that monetary policy is\nmore appropriately viewed as the path of the policy rate, not simply the current rate.\nThis is evident today as the markets seem highly attentive to signals regarding the\nfuture path of the funds rate not simply its current setting.\nBecause systematic policy is easily communicated to the public, it also greatly improves\nthe transparency and predictability of monetary policy, which reduces policy surprises.\nBusinesses and consumers are more informed about the course of monetary policy\nbecause they understand how policymakers are likely to react to changing economic\ncircumstances even if they are not certain what those economic conditions might be.\n\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy,\nNorth-Holland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n6\n\n\fEqually important in my view is that greater clarity about the policymakers’ reaction\nfunction strengthens accountability. Thus, systematic policy, communicated\ntransparently, strengthens accountability and serves to preserve the central bank’s\nindependence.\nIn this regard, Taylor-like rules have many of these desirable features. They are\nsystematic, based on a limited number of variables, perform well in a variety of models,\nand can therefore provide important guidance for policy decisions. If our policy is\nguided by state-contingent rules, then by reporting our assessment about the evolution\nor forecast of key economic variables, the public will get a better understanding and\nappreciation of the likely path of policy. Indeed, that is likely to be the best information\nwe can provide regarding the future path of policy.\nRules as Benchmarks: A Step Forward\nGiven model uncertainty and data measurement problems, there are, of course,\nlimitations to the use of a simple rule. A robust rule is intended to work well on\naverage, but central banks look at many variables in determining policy. Inevitably,\nthere will be times when economic developments fall outside the scope of our models\nand warrant unusual monetary policy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial\ncrisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the 1987 stock market crash may require\ndepartures from a simple rule.\nHowever, in such unusual circumstances, policymakers will be expected to explain the\ndepartures from the rule. With a rule as a baseline, departures can be quantified and\ninform us how excessively tight or easy policy might be relative to normal. If the events\nare temporary, policymakers will have to explain how and when policy is likely to return\nto normal. Thus, a simple rule provides a valuable benchmark for assessing and\ncommunicating the appropriate stance of policy.\n\n7\n\n\fThe operational question is how might we go about the effort to implement a more\nrules-based policy?\nOne strategy could be to indicate the likely behavior of interest rates based on a few\nTaylor-like rules that have been consistent with the conduct of monetary policy in the\npast or ones that are considered robust across various models. Doing so would require\nagreement on a particular model in order to produce the resulting rule-based behavior.\nFor the Fed, the economic model developed by the Board’s staff seems like a reasonable\nplace to start. Such an exercise could also be enhanced, I believe, by using some of the\ndynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, models that have been developed\nwithin the Federal Reserve System.\nAs a start, the results of this type of exercise could be published in the FOMC’s current\nbiannual monetary policy report to Congress. Perhaps we might consider releasing\nthese reports on a quarterly basis in keeping with other central banks. The Committee\ncould then indicate whether and why it anticipates policy to be somewhat more\nrestrained or more accommodative relative to the projections given by the various rules.\nThe monetary policy report could also include various views that may differ from the\nbaseline summaries.\nA major benefit of this exercise would be to illustrate the various dimensions of\nuncertainty that policymakers face. Financial markets often prefer certainty about the\nfuture path of monetary policy, but that is unrealistic and not necessarily desirable. For\nexample, this exercise would indicate the extent of model uncertainty, forecast\nuncertainty, and the variations implied by different rules. Many central banks use fan\ncharts and other devices to highlight such bands of uncertainty about the forecast, and\nthe Fed should do the same.\nOverall, this exercise would provide a better sense of the likely direction of policy and\nthe variables most related systematically to that policy. It would also lead the FOMC to\n8\n\n\fdiscuss policy in the context of rules and a systematic approach to decision-making,\nwhich I believe will lead to better decisions and better economic outcomes over the\nlonger run. Moreover, it would require policymakers to explain why they choose to\ndeviate from the benchmarks and the guidelines they provide.\nAn Example\nAs I discussed, communication is an important aspect of monetary policy. I have long\nbeen an advocate of the Fed producing a periodic monetary policy report similar to\nother central banks. It is simply too difficult to convey monetary policy design and\nstrategy within the confines of the brief statements issued at the conclusion of each\nFOMC meeting. Therefore, what I am about to suggest should not be viewed in isolation\nbut as one part of such a periodic report to the public.\nSo, let me illustrate how we might begin to incorporate a more systematic and\ntransparent approach to rule-like decision-making. I view this as one step in a journey,\nnot as the end result.\nMy example uses five simple rules that have been discussed in the literature and\ndescribes their implications for the projected path of the funds rate from now through\n2015. Since these rules are contingent on economic conditions, I will use the midpoint\nof the forecasts derived from the most recent SEP and apply an Okun’s law relationship\nto convert projections of unemployment into projections of economic slack. I should\nimmediately note that this is not a completely coherent exercise as each participant’s\nprojections were based on his or her own view of optimal policy and, as you are well\naware, those views differ. Put differently, the midpoint of the projections arises from an\namalgam of different models and thus represents no one’s forecast or model. Thus, the\nresults are likely to be more diverse than otherwise expected. So my example is purely\nillustrative yet easily replicable. However, given the relevance of the SEP, I thought the\nexercise would be more interesting than if I used an off-the-shelf economic model.\n9\n\n\fThe rules I have chosen are these: first, the original Taylor 1993 rule; second, a variant\nof Taylor’s original rule, sometimes called the Taylor 1999 rule, which places greater\nemphasis on the output gap; third, a version of the Taylor 1999 rule that allows for\nconsiderable interest-rate smoothing and is called the inertial Taylor 1999 rule; fourth, a\nperformance- or outcome-based rule developed by staff at the Philadelphia Fed that is\nsimply an estimated rule that best mimics previous FOMC actions; and fifth, a firstdifference rule that is based on academic work of Athanasios Orphanides and is\ndesigned to take into account the imprecision and uncertainties of our measurements of\nthe level of the output gap or slack and the underlying or steady state real rate of\ninterest.4\nI have plotted the outcome of this exercise in Figure 1. So what can we take away from\nthis picture? First, all the rules suggest that liftoff of the funds rate from the zero bound\nshould occur next quarter. This is considerably sooner than many seem to be expecting.\nSecond, we can also see that although the rules point to policy being tighter, they do\npresent somewhat different profiles of the future path of interest rates. The Taylor 93\nand Taylor 99 rules have a steeper path over the next several quarters than the other\nrules. The primary reason for this is that both of these rules are playing catchup as they\nwould have had liftoff occur earlier. After catchup, they increase more slowly. This\ndispersion in the pace of tightening also reflects model uncertainty. But ignoring or\ndismissing the rules does not avoid the problem such uncertainty poses. Robust rules,\nsuch as the first-difference rule, tend to have better outcomes on average across\nmodels.\n\n4\n\nSee the Appendix for the precise mathematical formulations of each of these rules and the relevant\nreferences.\n\n10\n\n\fThird, we see that three of the policy paths are not that different from each other.\nTaylor 93, Taylor 99, and the performance based rules tend to converge to between 2.5\nand 3.0 percent by mid-2015 and remain close thereafter.\nMy own assessment of appropriate policy is similar to that described by the firstdifference rule. However, my point is not to decide which path is correct, but to\nillustrate how such benchmarks can be useful for communications.\nFor example, the exercise might suggest that policy choices that fall outside the bounds\nof these rules should be viewed with some caution. That does not mean they would be\nwrong but they would require careful and substantial discussion and justification.\nEven for policy choices that might fall within the bounds, the exercise can provide\nmeaning, quantitative and qualitative, to phrases such as rates are expected to be\n“lower than normal.”\nAnother way of highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the future path of policy is to\nconsider different paths for the economy. Consider Figure 2. Here I employ the first\ndifference rule but consider the implications of a stronger and a weaker path for the\neconomy. To illustrate the range of policy paths that could ensue, I use three different\nforecasts, the midpoint forecast from the SEP, as in the previous chart, as well as two\nhypothetical forecasts. The first takes a combination of the lowest inflation and highest\nunemployment forecasts (a weak forecast), and the second does just the opposite by\ncombining the highest inflation and lowest unemployment forecasts (a strong forecast).\nOf course, neither represents a particular forecast or model; they combine various\nelements of different forecasts. Thus, the exercise represents a fairly extreme\nconstruction of forecast uncertainty. In any event, we observe a wide range for the\npredicted funds rate paths as in the first experiment. The weakest forecast anticipates a\nfunds rate of nearly 1 percent by the end of 2015, while the strongest forecast envisions\na funds rate of about 4.7 percent in part because both inflation and unemployment\n11\n\n\f“overshoot” their long-run and sustainable values and corrections must follow. Note,\nhowever, that even the weakest economic view coupled with the first-difference rule\nhas the funds rate rising above the zero lower bound next quarter. This picture is\nanalogous, but not in a precise way, to a fan chart.\nI have indicated throughout my talk the imprecision of our knowledge about the\neconomy. My understanding is no more precise than the understanding of colleagues\nor private-sector economists. These two exercises highlight the model and forecast\nuncertainty policymakers face. Rather than trying to target particular future values of\nthe policy rate, a monetary policy report under a rules-based approach could convey the\nuncertainty and still assure that decisions will be driven by the state of the economy.\nThese two exercises indicate a need to explain more fully why policy is deviating from\nwhat is suggested by these rules.\nNo doubt, there is a variety of views on this issue, but I think the policy process itself\nand our communication of policy would benefit greatly from producing a detailed\nmonetary policy report with some of the features I have discussed today.\n\n12\n\n\f13\n\n\fAppendix\nTaylor 1993\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n𝑖𝑡 = 𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝑡\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n+ 0.5�𝜋𝑡\n\n− 2� + 0.5(𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ )\n\nTaylor, John B. “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference\nSeries on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December 1993), pp. 195–214.\n(http://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Papers/Discretion.PDF)\n\nTaylor 1999\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n𝑖𝑡 = 𝑅 ∗ + 𝜋𝑡\n\n𝑎𝑣𝑔\n\n+ 0.5�𝜋𝑡\n\n− 2� + (𝑦𝑡 − 𝑦𝑡∗ )\n\nTaylor, John B. “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B.

Rules-based policy is a topic that I have discussed\nnumerous times in the past few years, urging policymakers to seek a more systematic approach\nto policymaking. I am particularly honored to be on a panel with my colleague John Williams,\nwhose research in this area has been an important influence on my views, as well as Tom\nSargent. In Tom’s case, there probably isn’t an economist in this room who hasn’t been\n1\n\n\finfluenced by his work and his contributions to economics. But before I go any further, I should\nbegin with the usual disclaimer that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nThe Theoretical Justification for Rules\nThe theory part of this session’s title is well established. In their Nobel Prize-winning work, Finn\nKydland and Ed Prescott demonstrated that a credible commitment by policymakers to behave\nin a systematic, rule-like manner over time leads to better outcomes than discretion. 1 Since\nthen, numerous papers using a variety of models have investigated the benefits of rule-like\nbehavior in monetary policy and found that there are indeed significant benefits. 2 Policies\ncharacterized by commitment have been shown to lead to more economic stability — lower\nand less volatile inflation and less volatile output. In fact, the mainstream theoretical models\nthat we use for monetary and macroeconomic analysis are built on the notion that monetary\npolicy is conducted in a rule-like manner.\nThe Practice\nThe practice part of the session title has proven to be a bit more elusive. The science of\nmonetary policy has not progressed to the point where we can specify the optimal rule for\nsetting monetary policy. The reason is that optimal rules, that is, those that maximize\neconomic welfare, are highly dependent on the particular model from which they are derived,\nand there is no broad-based consensus for the right model. More relevant is the finding that\nthe optimal rule for one model can produce very bad outcomes in another model. In addition,\noptimal rules can often be quite complex, thus making them difficult to implement and to\ncommunicate to the public. In other words, they may not be very transparent.\n\n1\n\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n2\n\nFor an excellent overview, see Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali, and Mark Gertler, “The Science of Monetary Policy,”\nJournal of Economic Literature (December 1999), pp. 1661–1707.\n\n2\n\n\fHowever, these limitations to implementing optimal policy rules should not deter us from\nefforts to adopt a more systematic rule-like approach to the conduct of policy. There has been\na great deal of progress made in identifying simple rules that appear to perform well in a\nvariety of models and environments. Such robust rules can form a basis for developing more\nsystematic, rule-like policymaking.\nOne important and desirable characteristic of a systematic and rule-like approach to policy\nrelates to communication. In particular, it is an approach that is easily communicated to the\npublic and thus greatly improves the transparency and predictability of monetary policy, which\nreduces surprises. The public and markets are more informed about the course of monetary\npolicy because they understand how policymakers are likely to react to changing economic\ncircumstances. Equally important in my view is that greater clarity about the policymakers’\nreaction function strengthens accountability and thus can serve to preserve the central bank’s\nindependence.\nThe most well-known simple rule, of course, is the one proposed by John Taylor in 1993.3 The\nTaylor rule and the family of rules it has inspired call for setting the nominal fed funds rate\nbased on three factors: the economy’s long-run real interest rate plus the Fed’s target rate of\ninflation, the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target, and the departure of real\nGDP from some measure of “potential” GDP. The rule implies, for example, that when inflation\nis above target, the funds rate should increase by more than one-for-one with the deviation,\nand when GDP is below “potential,” the funds rate should be reduced.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact that they seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well.\nTaylor-like rules tend to fall in the class of those rules that are robust. That is, they yield good\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy, NorthHolland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n3\n\n\fresults in a variety of theoretical settings. This feature is of enormous practical importance.\nGiven our uncertainty about the true model of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in\nthe form of a Taylor-like rule delivers good outcomes in a variety of models means that simple,\nrobust rules can provide useful guidance for policy.\nGiven model uncertainty and data measurement problems, there are, of course, limitations to\nthe use of a simple rule. The rule is basically intended to work well on average, but central\nbanks look at many variables in determining policy. There inevitably will be times when\neconomic developments fall outside the scope of our models and warrant unusual monetary\npolicy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of Lehman Brothers,\nand the 1987 stock market crash may require departures from a simple rule. Having articulated\na rule guiding policymaking in normal times, however, policymakers will be expected to explain\nthe departures from the rule in these unusual circumstances. With a rule as a baseline,\ndepartures can be quantified and inform us how excessively tight or easy policy might be\nrelative to normal. If the events are temporary, policymakers will have to explain how and\nwhen policy is likely to return to normal. Thus, a simple rule provides a valuable benchmark for\nassessing the appropriate stance of policy. That makes it a useful tool to enhance effective\ncommunication and transparency.\nRules and Forward Guidance\nIn addition to providing important guidance for current policy decisions, Taylor-like rules can\nalso be extremely useful in providing guidance for the expected future path of policy. Such\nforward guidance has received a good deal of attention recently. One reason for this increased\nattention is that short-term rates have been constrained by the zero lower bound. Thus,\nforward guidance and communication regarding future policy decisions take on greater\nsignificance.\nHowever, forward guidance is not a separate or independent policy tool. Its effectiveness is\nintimately related to other features of monetary policy. Monetary policy should be thought of\n4\n\n\fmore holistically, if you will. How effective we are with forward guidance, for example, can only\nbe assessed or thought of in the context of a central bank’s overall approach to policy, including\nits approach to communication and transparency.\nIn particular, I see a credible, rule-like approach to policy and the general openness and\ntransparency of the policy process as essential elements in shaping expectations. Indeed, a\ncommitment to a policy framework that is systematic and rule-like provides the foundation for\nestablishing expectations concerning the future path of policy and thus forward guidance.\nRules as Benchmarks: A Step Forward\nSo from my perspective, using Taylor-like rules to shape current and expected future policy is\nan important and useful part of any monetary policy framework. The operational question is\nhow might one go about such an effort? This is not a trivial assignment. As I mentioned at the\noutset, it has proved to be quite elusive.\nIn a stylized world, where there is a single monetary policymaker who has considerable\nconfidence in a model of the economy, communication would include a forecast derived from\nthis model. This forecast would incorporate a policy path that yields the best economic\noutcomes based on that single policymaker’s views.\nUnfortunately, we don’t live in such a world. Monetary policymaking is often conducted by\ncommittee, and divergent views can and often do exist. While this can be clumsy at times, such\ngovernance mechanisms ensure that various views are heard in an environment that promotes\nbetter decisions and better outcomes.\nNevertheless, I believe that given the nature of U.S. institutional arrangements, Taylor-like rules\ncan serve a very useful purpose. Specifically, they could underpin the construction of a periodic\ndetailed monetary policy report, a feature of communication that has been adopted by many\n\n5\n\n\fcentral banks around the world. However, while these reports have many similarities, there are\nsome key differences.\nMany central banks include detailed forecasts in their published reports and highlight risks\nalong with the outlook. This communication about the evolution of key economic variables\nthat shape policy is important, but there is still debate about the nature of the forecasts and\nthe assumptions that underlie them.\nA critical piece of a forecast emanating from the central bank is the nature of the future path of\nthe policy rate. Should a central bank’s published forecast be based on its assessment of what\nthe policy rate path is likely to be, perhaps based on its reaction function, or should the forecast\nbe based on an interest rate path that is more arbitrary, such as a constant interest rate path or\none that is related to market expectations?\nAn alternative approach that could easily be adopted would be to indicate the likely behavior of\ninterest rates based on a few different Taylor-like rules that have been consistent with the\nconduct of monetary policy in the past or ones that are considered robust across various\nmodels of the economy. Doing so would require agreement on a particular model in order to\nproduce the resulting rule-based behavior. For the Fed, the economic model developed by the\nBoard’s staff, called FRB/US, seems like a reasonable place to start. Such an exercise could also\nbe enhanced, I believe, by using some of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE,\nmodels that have been developed within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe FOMC could then use its biannual monetary policy reports to communicate the results and\nwhether and why it anticipates policy to be somewhat more restrained or more\naccommodative relative to the projections given by the various rules. The monetary policy\nreport could also include various views that may differ from the baseline summaries. Policy\nstatements between reports can refer back to the reports to provide consistency in the\nCommittee’s communications with the public.\n6\n\n\fPerforming this exercise would illustrate the various dimensions of uncertainty that\npolicymakers face. For example, there is model uncertainty, forecast uncertainty, and the\nvariations implied by different rules. Many central banks use fan charts and other devices to\nhighlight such bands of uncertainty about the forecast, and the Fed should do the same. It\nwould provide a better sense of the likely direction of policy and the variables most related\nsystematically to that policy. Further, this type of communication would push the FOMC to\nconduct policy in a more systematic manner, which I believe will lead to better economic\noutcomes over the longer run.\nConclusions\nI am fully aware that we need to take great care in providing more specific forms of forward\nguidance so that we avoid a false sense of certainty and a mistaken sense of commitment. Yet,\nI believe systematic rule-like monetary policymaking can enhance economic performance, and\ntherefore, I favor clearer communication concerning the formulation of policy.\nProviding information about how the policy path is likely to evolve forces policymakers to think\nmore deeply and more systematically about policy. Communication about that path, in turn,\ngives the public a much deeper understanding of the analytical approach that guides monetary\npolicy.\n\n7\n\n\f"

I would also like to thank Professor Maury Obstfeld for suggesting a number of\ninteresting topics for us to consider. He has highlighted some issues that I believe are\nintimately related to one another: namely, the central bank’s ability to influence expectations\nthrough forward guidance, the role of quantitative easing, and the process of exiting from that\neasing. Indeed, I think it is important that we think about monetary policy more holistically, if\nyou will. How effective we are with forward guidance or quantitative easing can only be\nassessed in the broader context of a central bank’s overall approach to policy, including its\n1\n\n\fapproach to communication and transparency.\nHowever, before I go any further, I should begin with the usual disclaimer that my views are my\nown and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nI want to focus my remarks today on communication and transparency in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. One major reason for this emphasis is the recognition that the stance of\nmonetary policy encompasses not just the current level of the short-term policy rate but its\nexpected future path as well. Economists have come to understand that expectations about\nmonetary policy can play an important role in determining economic outcomes, such as real\neconomic growth and inflation. For example, today’s decision to save or to spend is influenced\nby the current interest rate as well as tomorrow’s expected future consumption. In turn,\ntomorrow’s expected future consumption is influenced by next period’s interest rate and next\nperiod’s expected future consumption. Therefore, the entire expected path of interest rates,\nnot just the current interest rate, influences today’s consumption. This is not only true for\npersonal consumption, but also business investment decisions, and the setting of prices and\nwages.\nAn element of communication that has received a good deal of attention is forward guidance.\nForward guidance relates to the communication about the future course of monetary policy,\nboth the likely path of the short-term policy rate as well as path of balance sheet actions\nassociated with quantitative easing.\nOf course, one reason for this increased focus on future policy actions is that the current shortterm policy rate conveys little information, as it has been constrained by the zero lower bound.\nThus, forward guidance in the U.S. has evolved to include information about the future pace\nand duration of asset purchases, as well as under what conditions, and how quickly, the policy\nrate might eventually lift off from the zero lower bound.\n2\n\n\fHowever, forward guidance is not a separate or independent tool of policy. Its effectiveness is\nintimately related to other features of monetary policy. For example, a credible, systematic\napproach to policy and the general openness and transparency of the policy process are\nessential elements in shaping expectations and thus must be considered when formulating\nforward guidance. For forward guidance to be successful, it must be credible. And it is difficult\nto make it credible if it is inconsistent with other features of the policy framework.\nOne of the most important ways to support credibility and thus the effectiveness of forward\nguidance is to practice it as part of a systematic policy framework. I believe that indicating how\nthe evolution of key economic variables systematically shapes current and future policy\ndecisions is critical to such a policy framework. Indeed, a commitment to a policy framework\nthat is systematic and rule-like provides the foundation for establishing expectations for the\nfuture path of policy and thus forward guidance.\nIf We Only Had a Reaction Function\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic and rule-like is to make policy history\ndependent and base policy decisions on the state of the economy. Doing so does not commit\nthe policymakers to particular future values of the policy rate, but describing a reaction\nfunction explains how the policy rate will be determined by economic conditions.\nUnfortunately, the science of monetary policy has not reached the point where we can specify\na precise or optimal rule for setting policy. That would require an agreed-upon model of the\neconomy — something we don’t have yet. Nevertheless, I believe systematic policy can be\nguided by various forms of robust rules, such as the one proposed by John Taylor — with which\nwe are all familiar.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact that they seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The\n3\n\n\freality is that Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical settings. This\nfeature of the rules is of enormous practical importance. Given our uncertainty about the true\nmodel of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in the form of a Taylor-like rule delivers\ngood outcomes in a variety of models means that these simple rules can provide useful\nguidance for policy.\nSystematic policies that provide important information about the policymakers’ reaction\nfunction combined with other information, such as the policymakers’ economic forecasts, can\nsharpen forward guidance in ways that reduce policy uncertainty and enhance economic\nperformance. Thus, well-designed communications are valuable, and behaving systematically\nhas the added advantage of making those communications easier for the public to understand.\nBalance Sheet Policies\nI have focused my discussion on forward guidance with respect to the setting of the policy rate,\nbut these principles apply equally to balance sheet policies. There is room to debate how\neffective balance sheet policies, such as quantitative easing, have been, and indeed, just how\nthey affect interest rates and economic activity. Some think balance sheet policies work\nthrough portfolio balance effects that alter risk premia. The quantitative effects on\nmacroeconomic outcomes, however, are unclear. And the theoretical underpinnings for this\nchannel depend on the model and the assumptions made regarding the extent of financial\nmarket frictions and the degree and form of market segmentation.\nOthers believe that quantitative easing acts through the potential signaling effects associated\nwith large changes in the balance sheet. Namely, adding to the balance sheet could signal a\nmore accommodative future policy, which lowers longer-term nominal and real interest rates,\nand thereby spurs current economic activity, including expected inflation. Of course, if the\npolicies and communications regarding the future path of the policy rate were transparent and\nfully credible, such signaling would not be necessary. Moreover, if signaling is the primary\nchannel through which large-scale asset purchases act, there remains much that we don’t\n4\n\n\funderstand about how to calibrate such operations. In any event, it will be important that the\nsignals conveyed by balance sheet policies are consistent with the forward guidance about\nfuture interest rate policies. This has been a difficult communications challenge at times for the\nFOMC. And it will likely remain a communications challenge as the Committee coordinates the\nunwinding of the Fed’s balance sheet with the gradual increase in the policy rate.\nImplementing Forward Guidance\nI have indicated conceptually why a systematic approach to communications is important but\nhave yet to discuss how a central bank might implement such an approach. This issue has\nreceived increased attention in recent years, with various central banks adopting different\nstrategies. The differences are based on alternative economic viewpoints as well as on varying\ninstitutional structures. I think the Fed can learn a great deal from the various approaches.\nMany of you in this room are very knowledgeable, and have thought deeply about the costs\nand benefits of the various approaches.\nA forecast is, of course, a critical piece of information emanating from the central bank, and the\nnature of the policy rate’s future path is an important element of that forecast. These forecasts\nare often presented and discussed by central banks in the form of published inflation or\nmonetary policy reports. Such reports can and should be an important element of a central\nbank’s communication and transparency about the policy process. But a number of interesting\nquestions arise. Should a central bank’s published forecast be based on its assessment of what\nthe policy rate path is likely to be, or should the forecast be based on an interest rate path that\nis more arbitrary, such as a constant interest rate path or one that is related to market\nexpectations?\nI am fully aware that great care needs to be taken in providing more specific forms of forward\nguidance. We must avoid a false sense of certainty regarding future policy or a mistaken sense\nof commitment to a specific path of policy rates. Yet, I believe there are approaches, like the\none I am about to suggest, that can avoid or mitigate these pitfalls. Because I believe\n5\n\n\fsystematic monetary policymaking can enhance economic performance, I am in favor of clearer\ncommunication concerning the formulation of policy.\nNow, in our stylized models, there tends to be a single monetary policymaker who knows the\nstructure of the economy. Therefore, the approach for communication would be a forecast\nderived from the policymaker’s model as well as a policy path that yields the best economic\noutcomes based on that model of the economy.\nUnfortunately, we don’t live in such a world. Monetary policymaking is often conducted by\ncommittee, and divergent views can and often do exist. While this can be clumsy at times, such\ngovernance mechanisms ensure that various views are heard. This promotes better decisions\nand outcomes and helps preserve central bank independence and accountability.\nThus, it may be difficult for a large committee like the FOMC to achieve a consensus forecast or\npolicy path. Yet, we can enhance our communication by indicating the likely behavior of\ninterest rates based on a few different Taylor-like rules that have been consistent with the\nconduct of monetary policy. Doing so would require agreement on a particular model in order\nto produce the resulting rule-based behavior. For the Fed, the economic model called FRB/US,\nwhich was developed by the Board’s staff, seems like a reasonable place to start. Such an\nexercise could also be enhanced, I believe, by using some of the dynamic stochastic general\nequilibrium, or DSGE, models that have been developed within the Federal Reserve System.\nThe FOMC could then articulate whether and why it anticipates policy to be somewhat more\nrestrained or more accommodative, relative to the projections given by the rules. The current\nmonetary policy report that the Fed delivers each February and July could be adapted to\ninclude those exercises as well as a discussion of the opinions of Committee members regarding\nthe results.\nIt is important that in performing this exercise we illustrate the various dimensions of\n6\n\n\funcertainty that policymakers face. For example, there is model uncertainty, forecast\nuncertainty, and the variations implied by different rules. Many central banks use fan charts\nand other devices to highlight such uncertainty, and we, the Fed, would be wise to do the same.\nEven acknowledging the uncertainty, the exercise will provide a better sense of the likely\ndirection of policy and the variables most related systematically to that policy.\nI believe these steps toward greater transparency and communication would be significant\nprogress, and would encourage the FOMC to conduct policy in a more systematic manner. I\nbelieve this would lead to better economic outcomes over the longer run.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Women in Housing & Finance meetings have\nfeatured a number of Federal Reserve policymakers in recent years. A review of their\nspeeches traces an arc through the turmoil in the U.S. housing market, which led to the\nworst financial crisis and economic downturn since World War II, the regulatory reform\nthat followed, and the moderate but steady recovery over the past five years.\nIn January 2008, then-Chairman Ben Bernanke addressed your group a month after the\nGreat Recession began, following sharp and dramatic declines in the U.S. housing\n1\n\n\fmarket during 2007. Then, in June 2009, former Governor Elizabeth Duke described the\nactions that the Federal Reserve had taken to contain the financial crisis and promote\neconomic recovery. In February 2011, former Kansas City Fed President Tom Hoenig\nasked whether the Dodd-Frank Act would actually improve the financial regulatory\nclimate and solve the yet-unresolved issue of too-big-to-fail institutions.\nToday, I am delighted to join you at a time when, despite the effects of the severe\nwinter weather, the economy is on the firmest footing it has been on since the recovery\nbegan. But this does not mean that we are likely to see, nor should we seek to see, a\nreturn to the unsustainable levels of residential real estate activity that preceded the\nfinancial crisis. That did not end well.\nInstead, the perspective I will offer today is one of sustainable improvement in housing\nin the context of a broader economic recovery. Then, I will close with some thoughts on\nmonetary policy. Before I continue, though, I will note that my views are my own and\nnot necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nSo, let me begin with an overview of the U.S. economy. We are almost five years into a\nrecovery that began in June 2009. Growth accelerated in the second half of 2013 but\nfaced some stiff winter headwinds in the first quarter of this year. Yet, I think most of us\nnow view this as a temporary weather-related slowdown and not a risk to the\nunderlying recovery.\nSnowstorms and frigid temperatures affected every aspect of the economy, from sales\nand hours worked to logistics and supply chains during the first quarter of the year. You\ncan’t sell a house if buyers can’t get in the front door. You can’t sell a car if it is buried in\nsnow. And even if your factory is producing goods, you can’t deliver them to your\ncustomers as scheduled if trucks can’t navigate the highways or if trains have to slow\n\n2\n\n\fdown to half their normal speed. My own view is that it will take another month or two\nbefore we can hope to see a somewhat clearer picture of the economy.\nThe first estimate of GDP growth for the first quarter of 2014 showed that the overall\neconomy was essentially flat, expanding at an annualized rate of just 0.1 percent. The\nunderlying details are more encouraging. Consumer spending increased 3 percent,\nmarking the 19th consecutive quarter of growth. This growth is supported by the fact\nthat households have reduced their debt and strengthened their balance sheets over\nthe past few years. And as the values of equities and real estate have risen, consumer\nsavings rates have fallen and consumption spending has increased.\nThe weakness in the overall GDP figure comes predominately from lackluster\ninvestment, both by businesses and homebuilders, as well as some pullback in exports\nand imports.\nOur business contacts as well as our surveys confirm that economic activity was greatly\nhampered by the winter weather in the Northeast and in other parts of the country.\nThe Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers in our region has been\na reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends in the U.S. The survey results\nindicate that manufacturing activity has been expanding for 11 of the past 12 months.\nThe only aberration was in February 2014, when respondents ascribed their declines to\nthe severe weather. But the survey has since indicated positive growth in March, April,\nand May. The ISM manufacturing index, which measures nationwide activity, similarly\ndropped in the winter months and has since bounced back.\nThus, I continue to believe that the U.S. economy is on a firmer footing today than it has\nbeen in several years. This is a cause for some optimism for continued progress in 2014.\nMy forecast has been for growth of about 3 percent in 2014, and while the weatherrelated softness in the first quarter may temper this full-year outlook somewhat, it\nhasn’t led me to downgrade my outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\n3\n\n\fOne of the most encouraging signs for the economy comes from the labor market,\nbelieve it or not. Employers added 288,000 jobs in April, the strongest gain since\nJanuary 2012, and job growth in February and March were revised upward by a total of\n36,000. The gains in April were broad-based across sectors, including 32,000 net new\njobs in construction. Indeed, net job growth has exceeded 200,000 in five of the past\nseven months, with only the frozen months of December and January showing\ndisappointing numbers. Even if we include those weak months, the economy has added\nmore than 200,000 jobs per month on average over the past seven months.\nThe unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent in April, down more than a full\npercentage point from a year ago and the lowest rate recorded in more than five years.\nThis month’s decline was particularly sharp and was driven, in part, by a decline in labor\nforce participation. I would note that the household survey, which gives us the\nunemployment rate, is more volatile than the establishment survey, which measures\nthe number of new jobs added. I would not be surprised if the unemployment rate\nmoved up a bit next month, but the downward trend continues, and we are making\nsignificant improvement. The number of those unemployed for more than 27 weeks\ndropped by 287,000 in April, and by 1.25 million since January 2013. While this is an\nimprovement in labor markets, everyone will readily agree that the long-term\nunemployed remain a serious concern.\nI expect that the unemployment rate will fall below 6.2 by the end of 2014. If anything,\nthis forecast may prove to be too pessimistic. Given the recent trends, an\nunemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.\nInflation remains benign. It is running somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2\npercent. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the\nprice index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. That figure came\nin at 1.2 percent last year and is running at about the same pace over the first two\nmonths of this year. It is important to defend our 2 percent inflation target both from\nbelow and above. Yet, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most recent statement,\n4\n\n\fthat inflation will move back toward our target over time. Indeed, we learned last week\nthat the CPI moved up in April and is now running at 2 percent over the past year and at\na 2.3 percent annual rate during the past three months.\nI am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and\nconsistent with our 2 percent target. Given the large amount of monetary\naccommodation that we have added and continue to add to the economy, I think there\nis some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nThere are risks with respect to my growth forecast as well. While there continues to be\nsome downside risk to growth, for the first time in years, I see the potential for more\nupside risk to the economic outlook. So as the economy gradually moves toward our 2\npercent inflation target and the labor market continues to improve, we will need to\ncalibrate monetary policy to reflect the improvements.\nConstruction and Housing Markets\nLet me offer some further observations on the housing market. Residential real estate is\na focus of many economists because it was ground zero for the financial crisis and the\nensuing Great Recession.\nIn the past, we tended to see housing lead the economy out of the recession, but for a\nnumber of reasons, that was not the case this time.\nAs we know, sales of existing homes plummeted from unsustainable peaks during the\nhousing boom. Sales bottomed out at an annual rate of 3.5 million houses in July 2010\nand then climbed steadily for three years to 5.4 million in July 2013. That was about the\nsame annual rate that we averaged in the years preceding the boom. Sales have fallen\nsomewhat since mid-2013, due in part to rising mortgage rates, but those rates remain\nlow by historical standards. The fundamentals of the housing market remain sound,\nincluding stronger household formation, solid job growth, and consumers with stronger\nbalance sheets.\n5\n\n\fHome prices are well below their peaks, but they continue to improve as the market\nrecovers. Two national measures were up recently: The S&P Case Shiller Home Price\nIndex was up 12.8 percent year over year in its latest February number, and the\nCoreLogic National House Price Index was up 11.1 percent in March.\nSome have expressed concern over the housing recovery in recent months, but I am\nmore optimistic. As I said, the fundamentals remain sound, and even though sales have\nleveled off recently, prices have continued to rise even over the past three months.\nThat suggests that supply may be restricting sales more than weaker demand. But we\nwill have to wait and see how the remainder of the spring and summer plays out.\nThe structure of housing finance in our country remains a topic of intense discussion as\nit was before, during, and after the crisis. As I have argued in the past, the governmentsponsored enterprises, or GSEs, were permitted to operate for private profit but with an\nimplicit guarantee from the government, and so they were able to take extraordinary\nrisk at the taxpayers’ expense. 1 This was a classic case of moral hazard, and it must not\nbe repeated.\nThere are many proposals for a new system of housing finance with varying levels of\ngovernment support. There is no clear or easy answer to the degree of government\ninvolvement in the housing market; that is a decision we must make as a nation,\ncarefully weighing the benefits of homeownership with the costs of the misallocation of\nscarce capital and the risks of unintended consequences.\nThe U.S. subsidizes homeownership, more than any other developed country. We do so\nby providing an interest deduction for home mortgages and by underwriting housing\ndebt through an explicit taxpayer support for the GSEs, which is reflected in mortgage\nrates. There are debates about the quantitative effects of these subsidies. But we\nshould not be afraid to ask hard questions. Most financial advisors would tell you to\n1\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Some Observations About Policy Lessons from the Crisis,” remarks at the Philadelphia\nFed Policy Forum, Philadelphia, PA, December 4, 2009.\n\n6\n\n\fdiversify your asset holdings, yet our housing policies incentivize families to do just the\nopposite: put your savings in your home. The policies encourage homeownership over\nother asset classes. The results for many families were devastating.\nThe GSEs were at the center of the housing storm and we have to date not addressed\nthe fundamental reforms required. However, if as a nation we choose to continue the\nsubsidies to homeownership, the government involvement and subsidies must be\nexplicit, transparent, and well understood. Burying those subsidies in complex financial\narrangements or in new semigovernment enterprises will be counterproductive.\nMarkets work best when the risks and rewards of decisions are clearly defined so that\nprices can accurately reflect each transaction and the appropriate risk monitoring takes\nplace.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some issues for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve lowered its\npolicy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero more than five years ago.\nSince the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional\naccommodation through large-scale asset purchases. We are now in our third round of\nthis quantitative easing.\nSince September 2012, the FOMC has added about $1.4 trillion in long-term Treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet through this program, known as\nQE3. It is already twice the size of the last round of asset purchases, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of\npurchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. It announced another $10 billion\nreduction in January, March, and April and is now purchasing $45 billion a month. If the\nFOMC continues this path of measured reductions, the purchase program will end\nsometime this fall. If the economy continues to improve, though, we could find\nourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history\nsuggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction.\n7\n\n\fIn addition to asset purchases, the Fed is using forward guidance to try and inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In the March and\nApril statements, the FOMC reaffirmed its highly accommodative stance. The statement\nused qualitative language to describe the economic conditions that would lead to\naction. The Committee reported that it will look at a wide range of information,\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and\ninflation expectations, and readings on financial developments, to assess progress —\nboth realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2\npercent inflation.\nThe FOMC also noted, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be\nappropriate to keep its target federal funds rate near zero for a considerable time after\nthe asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the 2 percent goal and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.\nMy own view is that, as we continue to move closer to our 2 percent inflation goal and\nthe labor market improves, we must be prepared to adjust policy appropriately. That\nmay well require us to begin raising interest rates sooner rather than later.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve at a moderate\npace. We are likely to see growth return to around 3 percent through the rest of 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment\nrate will continue to decline, reaching 6.2 percent or lower by the end of 2014. I also\nbelieve that inflation expectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move\nup toward our goal of 2 percent over the next year.\nI expect the housing and construction sectors will continue to recover. But we should\nnot seek to return to the heady days of last decade’s real estate boom.\nOn monetary policy, reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving\nin the right direction, but the pace may leave us behind the curve if the economy\n8\n\n\fcontinues to play out according to FOMC forecasts.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis.\nLet me conclude with this thought. Over the past five years, the Fed and, dare I say,\nmany other central banks have become much more interventionist. I do not think this is\na particularly healthy state of affairs for central banks or our economies. The crisis in\nthe U.S. has long passed. With a growing economy and the Fed’s long-term asset\npurchases coming to an end, now is the time to contemplate restoring some semblance\nof normalcy to monetary policy.\nIn my view, the proper role for monetary policy is to work behind the scenes in limited\nand systematic ways to promote price stability and long-term growth. Since the onset\nof the financial crisis, central banks have become highly interventionist in their efforts to\nmanipulate asset prices and financial markets in general as they attempt to fine-tune\neconomic outcomes. This approach has continued well past the end of the financial\ncrisis. While the motivations may be noble, we have created an environment in which\n“it is all about the Fed.” Market participants focus entirely too much on how the central\nbank may tweak its policy, and central bankers have become too sensitive and desirous\nof managing prices in the financial world. I do not see this as a healthy symbiotic\nrelationship for the long term.\nIf financial market participants believe that their success depends primarily on the next\ndecisions of monetary policymakers rather than on economic fundamentals, our capital\nmarkets will not deliver the economic benefits they are capable of providing. And if\ncentral banks do not limit their interventionist strategies and focus on returning to more\nnormal policymaking aimed at promoting price stability and long-term growth, then\n9\n\n\fthey will simply encourage the financial markets to ignore fundamentals and to focus\ninstead on the next actions of the central bank.\nI hope we can find a way to make monetary policy decision-making less interventionist,\nless discretionary, and more systematic. I believe our longer-term economic health will\nbe the beneficiary.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fWelcoming Remarks\nReinventing Older Communities: Bridging Growth & Opportunity\nPhiladelphia, PA\nMay 12, 2014\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHighlights\n• President Charles Plosser welcomes participants to the 2014 Reinventing Older Communities\nbiennial conference.\n• President Plosser highlights emerging trends in the labor market, demographics, and educational\nsystem and discusses how understanding them can help prepare communities for growth and\nprosperity.\n• President Plosser says it is important to think about how we can continue to upgrade the skills and\nproductivity of young people and the workforce more broadly to successfully reinvent our\ncommunities.\n\nIntroduction\nIt is my pleasure to welcome you to the Reinventing Older Communities conference. This is the\nsixth biennial conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It has grown to\nbecome an important event for the Federal Reserve System as we bring together a rich and\ndiverse mix of stakeholders who are interested in understanding the interaction between older\nindustrial communities and the broader economy.\nThe Federal Reserve System, which is marking its centennial year, is a decentralized central\nbank, with 12 individual Reserve Banks throughout the country that are overseen by a Board of\nGovernors in Washington, D.C. As Theresa Singleton mentioned, we are delighted that seven of\nthose Federal Reserve Banks are partnering with us to sponsor this year’s conference. I thank\nthem and the other sponsors who have helped us create what promises to be an outstanding\nevent.\n1\n\n\fI also want to thank you for taking the time to join us for this conference. Your participation\nhere and your ongoing work in communities around the nation demonstrate your commitment\nto bridge growth and opportunity. In that way, we can reinvent our communities to ensure they\nare places where people can lead fulfilling and successful lives. But this work requires a creative\nforward-looking approach.\nMaybe it’s the fact that the Stanley Cup playoffs are still going on in mid-May, but I’m reminded\nthat Wayne Gretzky was once asked about his success in hockey. The Great One responded by\nsaying, “I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.” He scored many\ngoals with this strategy, and I believe his philosophy can be helpful in many disciplines. For\nexample, I have talked about the need for monetary policy to be forward looking. But I believe\nthis approach also applies to the revitalization of older communities.\nNow, I am by no means a community development expert or a hockey player. During my\nlifetime, I have lived in several older communities, including Rochester, NY, and Birmingham,\nAL, where I was born. I attended college in Nashville, TN, and graduate school in Chicago. I have\nlived and worked in New York City, as well as in and around Los Altos, CA, near the heart of\nSilicon Valley, and for almost eight years now, I have lived here in Philadelphia.\nIt occurs to me that often older communities seek to turn back the clock to restore their past\nglories. A variation is to chase the puck. But in so doing, they find themselves perpetually in the\npast, never quite catching up and usually falling further behind. These are unlikely to be\nsuccessful strategies. It is appropriate to learn from the past. But trying to restore the past is\nnot a strategy for success. As most of you are aware, rebuilding and revitalizing our older cities\nis not about the past but our ability to seize the future.\nThe Philadelphia of tomorrow will not the Philadelphia of the past, nor should it be. There are\nmany opportunities for productive transitions and improvements. Indeed, we should seek to\n2\n\n\fexploit the latest innovations to make Philadelphia, like many of our postindustrial cities\nrepresented here today, wonderful places to live, work, and play. We have to acknowledge that\nour world has changed, and it continues to change at a very rapid pace. Embracing that change\nin order to reinvent the future of our cities is hard work, but it can pay off handsomely.\nThe extent to which we are able to see where emerging trends are headed — where the puck\nwill be, if you will — gives us the chance to take advantage of the opportunities they present.\nThat will allow our communities to be more successful and more effective.\nI want to spend the remainder of my brief time discussing a few emerging issues for you to\nconsider over the next few days, as you participate in the conference workshops and plenary\nsessions.\nEmerging Trends\nMy comments will focus on the labor market and the importance it plays in shaping the future\nof our nation, but more relevant for this group, how it is shaping the future of our cities. The\nfinancial crisis and Great Recession led to severe dislocations in many sectors of our economy,\nincluding the housing sector, financial markets, and the labor market. Monetary and fiscal\nauthorities responded in myriad ways to help the economy and our nation recover. But we\nshould resist the temptation to implement programs with the goal of recreating the past.\nThe unemployment rate has slowly recovered and is now 6.3 percent from its peak of 10\npercent in October 2009. Some are skeptical, though, because the decline in the\nunemployment rate reflects not only increases in employment but declines in labor force\nparticipation. Many interpret such declines in the participation rate as representing\ndiscouraged workers who have stopped looking for work. Yet, labor force participation rates\ncan also decline for demographic reasons. Indeed, we have seen steadily declining participation\nrates since 2000, and we can account for about three-quarters of this decline in participation\n\n3\n\n\fsince the start of the recession in December 2007 because of increased retirements and\nmovements into disability.\nDemographic trends, driven largely by an aging baby boomer generation, are altering the age\ndistribution of our population. More specifically, we are getting older, and the size of the\nworking age population is shrinking relative to those over 65. It is widely recognized that this\nfundamental shift will require major changes in the structure of Social Security and Medicare\nprograms.\nYet even as we solve such fiscal challenges associated with an aging population, we have to face\nup to the changing skills that employers are seeking. We are seeing a mismatch of skills in the\nworkforce and the jobs that are being created. Many employers I have spoken to around the\ncountry talk about the fact that while they are hiring new workers, they are hiring a new type of\nworker: a worker who is more technologically sophisticated and productive. Going forward our\neducational system needs to be upgraded to prepare young people for this changing labor\nmarket. We are simply not keeping pace.\nMore specifically, business leaders I have met talk repeatedly about having trouble finding\nqualified candidates in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math, or so-called\nSTEM jobs. As you know, the increasing needs for STEM-trained workers is one of the trends\nthat will drive labor demand and productivity growth in our future. The Department of\nCommerce estimates that STEM employment grew at three times the rate of non-STEM\nemployment in the previous decade and is projected to grow at twice the rate of non-STEM\njobs through 2018.\nSadly, we are not doing an adequate job of preparing our workforce for these jobs.\nManufacturing is one sector in which firms have implemented new production technologies\nand are in need of STEM workers. The Philadelphia Fed’s April Business Outlook Survey of\nmanufacturers included a special question about the factors influencing their decisions to\n4\n\n\fremain in the region. Respondents identified the availability of skilled labor as the most\nimportant factor. They also ranked the availability of skilled labor as becoming a more\nimportant factor in recent years.\nThese concerns highlight the importance of our educational system in equipping our young\npeople with the skills necessary to improve their own lives and improve the communities in\nwhich they live and work. Better wages accrue to a more productive employee. Firms will not\nlocate in communities where they cannot find workers with the right skills and work ethic. For\nour older communities, successful revitalization will mean seeing to it that the workforce is up\nto the task.\nThe standard of living in our nation as well as our communities is inextricably tied to the\nproductivity of our workforce. As we look to the future, we have to think about how we can\ncontinue to upgrade the skills and productivity of young people and the workforce more\nbroadly. If we are to successfully reinvent our communities, we must focus on preparing our\nworkforce for the future.\nConclusion\nLet me conclude by reminding you that the theme of this year’s conference is Bridging Growth\nand Opportunity. And I can think of no better bridge to opportunity than education. Education\nis a bridge for our young people and a bridge for our local economies. As someone who has\nspent over three decades in the teaching profession, I firmly believe that education is one of\nour most important investments. It is critical for the long-term health and prosperity of our\nnation. Education expands opportunity, leads to more innovation, and enhances productivity. In\nthe end, this leads to better economic outcomes.\nI am excited that this year’s conference will highlight the critical role that education and\nworkforce development play in reinventing older communities. We are honored to host a Sit\nDown with the Superintendents, a panel session that will give you an opportunity to engage in a\n5\n\n\fdialogue with school superintendents from several older industrial cities. This is your chance to\ndiscuss how community development and educational leaders can work together to connect\npeople with the right skills to the jobs ahead. This is another example in which those of you\nwho think about workforce development can get ahead of the puck. And score a goal for all\nolder communities.\nThe work that you do — building these bridges to opportunity — is about creating a better\nfuture for all of us who live in these special places. It will not be easy, and there is no quick fix,\nbut it will be one of the most important things we can do. Thank you for participating in our\nprogram this year.\n\n6\n\n\f"

It’s a pleasure to return to the Council on Foreign\nRelations. I know that the value of these sessions often arises during the discussion, so I will try\nto keep my opening remarks brief. Before I go any further, though, I should begin with the usual\ndisclaimer that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe topic I want to address today is communication and transparency in the conduct of\nmonetary policy. Some of you can recall when it was taken for granted that the central bank\nwas supposed to be secretive and mysterious. The guiding principle was simple: The less said\nabout monetary policy, the better. Indeed, it was not until 1994 that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) began to announce policy changes made at its meetings.\n\n1\n\n\fBut times have changed. Transparency has replaced secrecy, and open communication has\nreplaced mystery. The extent of this transformation is, in many ways, remarkable. Today, the\nissues of communication and transparency are front and center on the agenda of many\nmeetings and conferences on central banking. A major reason for the focus on these issues is\nthe recognition that the stance of monetary policy encompasses not just the current level of\nthe short-term policy rate but its expected future path as well. More broadly, economists have\ncome to understand that expectations, including expectations about monetary policy, play an\nimportant role in determining economic outcomes, such as real economic growth and inflation.\nOne element of communication that has received a good deal of attention is forward guidance.\nForward guidance is central bankers’ speak for communication about the future course of\nmonetary policy, and particularly about the likely path of the short-term policy rate. One reason\nfor this increased attention on the future path of policy is that short-term rates have been\nconstrained by the zero lower bound. So when, or under what conditions, the nominal policy\nrate might eventually rise takes on greater significance.\nHowever, forward guidance is not a separate or independent tool of policy. Its effectiveness is\nintimately related to other features of monetary policy. In particular, a credible, systematic\napproach to policy and the general openness and transparency of the policy process are\nessential elements in shaping expectations. Even with this recognition, there are various views\nabout how best to communicate information about the intended path of policy and how to\nensure that such information is credible. If it is not credible, then it will not shape expectations\nin a beneficial way.\nMore generally, a central bank can and often does communicate on a host of important issues,\nincluding its view of the current state of the economy, its assessment of risks, and its outlook\nfor key economic variables. Perhaps most important, from my perspective, is communication\nabout how the evolution of key economic variables systematically shapes current and future\npolicy decisions.\n2\n\n\fIn my remarks this morning, I want to stress the importance of the FOMC articulating such a\nsystematic approach to policy. Doing so is likely to make forward guidance more effective, by\nhelping the public to better interpret what that guidance means.\nThe Benefits of Systematic Monetary Policy\nSo what do I mean by a systematic approach to policy? Quite simply, I mean conducting policy\nin a more rule-like manner. The antithesis of such rule-like behavior, of course, is discretion;\nthat is, policymaking conducted period by period with great latitude to take whatever actions\nseem best at the time.\n\nThe rules-versus-discretion debate in economics is an old one, dating back at least to Henry\nSimons in 1936.1 Yet, following the Nobel Prize-winning work of Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott in\n1977, most academic economists — but, unfortunately, far fewer policymakers — have come to\naccept the benefits of adhering to rule-like behavior in monetary policy. 2 These benefits arise,\nin part, because consumers and businesses are forward looking, and credible commitments\nconcerning the determinants of the future path of policy can alter expectations in ways that\nmake policy more effective and less uncertain. The ability to behave systematically and to align\nthe public’s expectations with that systematic behavior can allow the central bank to increase\ncurrent economic activity, while simultaneously lowering inflation. But a credible commitment\nto honor past promises is an essential element of rule-like policy. Discretionary decision-making\nundermines such commitments.\n\nThe appropriate way to make policy systematic, or rule-like, is to base policy decisions on the\nstate of the economy. That is, policymakers should describe the reaction function that\ndetermines how the current and future policy rate will be set depending on the state of the\n1\n\nHenry C. Simons, “Rules versus Authorities in Monetary Policy,” Journal of Political Economy, 44:1 (January 1936).\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (June 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\feconomy. Policymakers are, of course, no more certain about future economic conditions than\nanyone else is, and therefore cannot realistically commit to particular future values of the\npolicy rate. Nonetheless, describing a reaction function or rule that explains how the policy rate\nwill be determined in the future as a function of economic conditions can be highly informative.\nUnfortunately, the science of monetary policy has not reached the point where we can specify\na rule for setting policy and turn decision-making over to a computer. Judgment is still required.\nNevertheless, I place a great deal of importance on systematic behavior both as prescription for\ngood policy and in terms of my own policy deliberations.\n\nMuch study has been done on various rules, but the most well-known rule is attributable to\nJohn Taylor.3 The Taylor rule is a reaction function that indicates how to set the policy rate as a\nfunction of deviations of inflation from the inflation target and some measure of economic\nslack.\nThe attractiveness of Taylor-like rules for monetary policy goes beyond their intuitive appeal or\nthe fact that they seem to describe the actual behavior of monetary policy reasonably well. The\nreality is that Taylor-like rules yield very good results in a variety of theoretical settings. While\nthis is surprising to some, it is of enormous practical importance. Given our uncertainty about\nthe true model of the economy, knowing that systematic policy in the form of a Taylor-like rule\ndelivers good outcomes in a variety of models means that these simple, robust rules can\nprovide useful guidance for policy.\n\nSystematic policies that provide important information about the policymakers’ reaction\nfunction combined with other information, such as the policymakers’ economic forecasts, can\nsharpen forward guidance in a way that reduces policy uncertainty and enhances economic\nperformance. Thus, well-designed communications are valuable, and behaving systematically\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy, NorthHolland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n4\n\n\fhas the added advantage of making those communications easier for the public to understand.\n\nIncreasing Transparency\nBut what else should the central bank convey? For example, should it publish forecasts of\nvariables in its policy reaction function and should these forecasts be based on the most likely\npath that the policy rate will follow or on some other assumption?\n\nWhile many central banks publish forecasts in detailed inflation or monetary policy reports,\nthere is still debate about the nature of the forecasts and the assumptions that underlie them.\nFor example, who owns the forecast? At some central banks, the forecast is that of the policy\ncommittee and thus represents a type of consensus forecast. In other cases, the forecast is that\nof the central bank staff. Individual policymakers who do not fully buy into the forecast are then\nfree to express their own independent views about the outlook.\nA critical piece of a forecast emanating from the central bank is the nature of the future path of\nthe policy rate. Should a central bank’s published forecast be based on its assessment of what\nthe policy rate path is likely to be, perhaps based on its reaction function, a so-called\nunconditional forecast? Or should the forecast be based on an interest rate path that is more\narbitrary, such as a constant interest rate path or one that is related to market expectations\ninferred from forward interest rates. Others question whether the central bank should reveal\nthe forecast’s assumed interest rate path at all.\n\nPerhaps the greatest fear preventing most central banks from publishing the best assessment\nof its future interest rate path is that the public will assume the projections will be taken as a\ncommitment to that path rather than a projection influenced by the evolution of the economy.\nIn my view, such fears could be mitigated if policymakers would articulate the way they\nsystematically expect to adjust policy in response to changes in economic conditions.\nWhile I have suggested potential problems if the central bank publishes its assessment of the\n5\n\n\flikely near-term path of policy rates, in conjunction with its economic forecast, there is also a\nmajor benefit; namely, the added discipline that it places on the policy process itself. As I\nalluded to in my introduction, monetary policy does not just affect the economy through the\ncurrent setting of the interest rate, but also through the expected path that the policy rate will\ntake over time. Providing information about how that path is likely to evolve forces\npolicymakers to think more deeply and systematically about policy. Communication about that\npath, in turn, gives the public a much deeper understanding of the analytical approach that\nguides monetary policy. Again, my view is that policy transparency and forward guidance could\nbe enhanced if the central bank was more explicit in articulating its systematic approach to\npolicy.\n\nConclusions and Going Forward\nI am fully aware that great care needs to be taken in providing more specific forms of forward\nguidance so that we avoid a false sense of certainty and a mistaken sense of commitment. Yet I\nbelieve systematic monetary policymaking can enhance economic performance, and therefore I\nfavor clearer communication concerning the formulation of policy.\nIn a stylized world, where there is a single monetary policymaker who has considerable\nconfidence in a model of the economy, effective communication would include a forecast\nderived from this model. This forecast would incorporate a policy path that yields the best\neconomic outcomes based on that single policymaker’s views.\nHowever, we don’t live in such a simple world. Monetary policymaking is often conducted by\ncommittee, and divergent views can and often do exist. While this can be clumsy at times, such\ngovernance mechanisms have great strength in preventing institutions from lapsing into\ngroupthink by ensuring that various views are heard in an environment that promotes better\ndecisions and outcomes and helps to preserve central bank independence and accountability.\nThus, it may be difficult for the FOMC to achieve a consensus forecast or policy path. One way\n6\n\n\fto enhance its communication would be to indicate the likely behavior of interest rates based\non a few different Taylor-like rules that have been consistent with the conduct of monetary\npolicy. Doing so would require agreement on a particular model in order to produce the\nresulting rule-based behavior. For the Fed, the Board staff’s economic model, called FRB/US,\nseems like a reasonable place to start. The FOMC could then articulate whether and why it\nanticipates policy to be somewhat more restrained or more accommodative relative to the\nprojections given by the rules. A monetary policy report that might accompany such a forecast\ncould include various views that may differ from the baseline summaries.\nPerforming this exercise would indicate the inherent uncertainty that policymakers face, yet it\nwould also provide a better sense of the likely direction of policy and the variables most related\nsystematically to that policy. Further, this type of communication would push the FOMC to\nconduct policy in a more systematic manner, which I believe will lead to better economic\noutcomes over the longer run.\n\n7\n\n\f"

We are very\npleased to partner with the Wharton School and the Journal of Financial Services Research in\nthis joint conference on “Enhancing Prudential Standards in Financial Regulations.” I want to\nacknowledge and thank the organizers for assembling such a distinguished group of academics\nand practitioners to discuss the ongoing efforts to improve our financial system.\n\nI am going to take advantage of my role as host to offer some of my own thoughts on financial\nregulations and financial stability. I will present a high-level perspective of the subject. I don’t\nplan to let the messy details get in the way of lofty thoughts. Instead, I believe it is helpful to\nstep back from the complicated details of financial regulation to think more broadly about the\ngoals and objectives of reform and the strategies that might best get us there. Of course, these\nviews are my own and should not be interpreted as representing the Federal Reserve System.\n1\n\n\fI think we all agree that financial markets and intermediaries play an important economic role\nby pooling funds from savers and investors and allocating these resources to their most\nproductive uses. Such allocations require financial intermediaries to assess and price various\nrisky claims. They then can sell some of the risks, either duration or credit risk, to investors and\nothers who are willing to bear that risk. Thus, intermediaries help allocate resources and risks\nthroughout the economy, thereby improving efficiency and productivity.\n\nAt times, however, financial intermediation can result in risks becoming concentrated in ways\nthat increase rather than reduce the fragility of the financial system more broadly. This is what\nmany people mean when they refer to systemic risk. While today I will use the term in this\nfashion, I would note that the concept is quite vague. One of the major difficulties we face in\nmanaging systemic risk is defining what it is and how to measure it. Ideally, one important goal\nof financial supervision and regulation is to monitor risk in the financial system and reduce the\nchances that it inadvertently leads to financial fragility or instability. Regulation, however,\nshould seek to do so without impeding the healthy functioning of financial markets and\ninstitutions.\n\nIn response to the financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act in 2010, which included enhanced capital and liquidity standards and\nrisk-management requirements for large financial institutions thought to be systemically\nimportant.\n\nIn addition to new regulations, the crisis brought about important changes in supervision.\nSupervisors are taking a macroprudential approach to their responsibilities. Rather than\nfocusing on the risk in a single institution, supervisors are spending more time analyzing risks\nacross firms. Large financial firms are now required to have stronger data and information\nsystems so they can better monitor and manage their own risks. And these firms are required\nto report higher quality data to supervisors. The Federal Reserve now utilizes these data as well\n\n2\n\n\fas other information it receives to conduct more in-depth and timely assessments of emerging\nrisks. Access to better data has also enabled supervisors to conduct the supervisory stress tests\nrequired by Dodd-Frank, which assess the ability of these large institutions to withstand a\nsevere economic downturn.\n\nThis conference will address the efficacy of many of these individual elements of Dodd-Frank\nand of supervisory reforms, which are still evolving nearly four years after the legislation was\nfirst enacted. For the remainder of my remarks, I wish to explore three broad principles that I\nbelieve we need to consider as we search for ways to improve the stability of our financial\nsystem. The first is simplicity. Our regulatory framework is becoming increasingly complex,\nwhich has led to rising compliance costs as well as enforcement costs. The second principle is\ntransparency. Financial markets and instruments have also become increasingly complex and in\nsome cases occasionally opaque. Ensuring that financial instruments and firms are sufficiently\ntransparent can contribute to greater efficiency and awareness of risks exposures. The third\nprinciple I will stress is the role that market forces can play in effectively controlling risk-taking\nand enhancing supervision.\n\nSimplicity\nLet me begin with simplicity. The financial world has become very complex and so has financial\nregulation. It is easy to claim that complex regulation is necessitated by the increasing\ncomplexity of the financial markets. After all, regulations are, in part, shaped by evolving\nmarket structures. In some cases, new regulations arise in response to a crisis or a perceived\nfailure of some kind. Unfortunately, markets often evolve faster than the regulations; detailed\nrule writing that underlies much of the complex regulation can become obsolete, which then\nrequires more rule writing.\n\nYet, we should consider that causality can work both ways. Regulations themselves give rise to\nincentives to evade the rules. Such regulatory arbitrage can result in increasingly complex\nfinancial structures designed to fall outside existing rules. This activity then begets more\n\n3\n\n\fcomplex rules that markets once again seek to avoid. Consider the increasing complexity and\ngranularity of the Basel risk-weighting classifications. The logic of assessing capital\nrequirements based on the risk of an institution’s assets is sensible in principle; however, it\ncreates incentives for institutions to structure assets in ways that minimize the use of capital,\nperhaps resulting in risks that become hidden in opaque or complex structures that are not\naddressed by specific rules or classifications found in the Basel framework.\n\nSuch a cycle of increasing complexity raises both compliance costs and enforcement costs.\nThus, I believe, there is merit in developing simpler, more transparent regulatory solutions\ndesigned to work reasonably well in a wide range of situations. For example, higher capital\nrequirements based on the leverage ratio, as opposed to overly complex risk-weighting\nschemes, might lower both compliance and enforcement costs while achieving similar or better\noutcomes in terms of the safety and soundness of individual institutions as well as overall\nfinancial stability.\n\nMoreover, there are examples of how market participants’ reactions to regulation may have\ncontributed to the recent financial crisis. For instance, the expansion of the shadow banking\nsystem was in many ways a result of attempts to circumvent regulations placed on banking\ninstitutions. Similarly, the use of bond ratings in setting bank capital requirements for securities\nholdings or in making eligible certain structured products for various investment purposes\ncreated incentives to inflate ratings of collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, and other\nstructured products backed by subprime mortgages. Consider bankruptcy rules that exempt\novernight swaps and repurchase agreements from the traditional stays when a company files\nfor bankruptcy. Such rules reduce the incentive for lenders to monitor counterparty risk and\nthus effectively lower the relative cost of using short-term funding to finance an intermediary’s\nor investment firm’s balance sheet. As we know, the reliance on short-term funding from\nsources totally immune from counterparty risk can contribute to increasing risks of contagion\nand runs on financial institutions.\n\n4\n\n\fIncreased regulatory complexity can make consistent enforcement of the rules more difficult.\nInconsistent enforcement can make it harder for financial institutions to predict how regulators\nare likely to behave. Such uncertainty can make the financial system less efficient and can\nundermine the credibility of the regulatory regime, thereby making the regime less effective in\nfostering financial stability. In contrast, simple regulations are easier for financial firms to\nfollow, increase the likelihood that supervisors will consistently enforce them, and are\ntherefore more likely to have the desired effect.\n\nTransparency\nNext, let me turn to transparency. Economists for the most part think transparency is a good\nthing, and I am no exception. I will talk about transparency from two perspectives. The first is\ntransparency regarding financial institutions and financial products. The second is transparency\nby regulators.\n\nAs is true of financial regulations, financial instruments have become increasingly complex,\nwhether due to market demands or incentives created by regulation. Whatever the reason, it is\nentirely appropriate to require adequate disclosure and transparency regarding the structure\nand risk of both the instruments and the institutions. Such transparency allows markets to\nbetter price the inherent risks of the securities and the firms. So put me in the camp of more\ndisclosure and transparency.\n\nBut just as markets can use information on securities and firms to improve market prices and\nassess risk exposures, markets are also likely to find value in regulatory information. As a bank\nregulator, the Federal Reserve gets a detailed view of how large financial institutions measure\nand manage risk. Banks and supervisors now use a host of sophisticated models and\ntechniques to assess risks.\n\nThere has been a long debate about the potential costs and benefits of releasing some\nregulatory information once treated as confidential. Many policymakers now believe that\n\n5\n\n\fpublic disclosure of additional information concerning the financial condition, risk exposures,\nand supervisory assessments of firms would be beneficial to financial stability. Greater\ntransparency would enable market participants to better assess the risks of counterparties and\nthereby exert more effective market discipline.\n\nIncreased transparency about supervisory practices would also allow financial firms to have\ngreater confidence about the “rules of the road.” This would reduce regulatory uncertainty and\nthe inefficiencies of regulatory arbitrage as firms try to guess what’s on the minds of regulators.\nWhen firms have a better understanding of regulatory requirements, they can appropriately\nevaluate the economic costs and benefits of their decisions.\n\nOf course, there are concerns that too much transparency can have unintended consequences.\nThe added information could lead to instability by creating runs on financial institutions if\nmarket participants misunderstand or overreact to negative news. Increased transparency\nmight reduce the quality and quantity of information that financial firms would share with\nregulators. While these concerns may be legitimate, I would argue that revealing more\ninformation about individual firms will reduce the likelihood of contagion and runs, as such\nevents generally arise from a lack of information, rather than too much information, about the\nriskiness of an individual firm.\n\nMarket Discipline\nThe final principle I would like to stress is the role of market discipline. I believe that market\ndiscipline can be a powerful tool in controlling the risk-taking of financial institutions. Notice\nthat transparency is an important ingredient in effective market discipline, since a more\ninformed market is likely to function more efficiently and set the prices of securities and firms\nmore accurately.\n\nAs we seek to improve and strengthen financial stability, we should think about mechanisms to\nmake market forces more effective, not just write rules that attempt to substitute for market\n\n6\n\n\fforces. Creating incentives for markets to monitor and price risk-taking by financial institutions,\nrather than have markets simply assume that regulators have monitored the risk for them, is a\ndesirable outcome. A complex and nontransparent regulatory regime can create its own form\nof moral hazard. Thus, efforts to enhance the effectiveness of market discipline are beneficial\nas they reduce the necessity of rules and interventions that can create perverse or unintended\nconsequences and the potential for moral hazard.\n\nAs one example of how regulation could harness market forces to promote financial stability,\nsome have proposed that financial institutions be required to issue subordinated debt. Owners\nof subordinated debt have a strong incentive to monitor risk-taking by these firms, as they are\nlast in line in the event of failure. Others and I have argued for contingent debt that would\nconvert to capital, in response to specific market triggers indicating that the firm was under\nstress. Such automatic recapitalization would help prevent firms from failing in the first place.\nManagers would have a strong incentive to avoid taking on risks that might lead to such events,\nas they would dramatically dilute existing shareholders.\n\nAnother way markets can aid supervision is through the information they can provide to\nsupervisors. Markets aggregate many risk assessments into a single measure, such as the price\nor quantity traded of a security. These market measures can be compared across institutions to\nprovide an indication of relative risk. The measures can also be monitored over time to provide\nindications of changes in risk. Market participants have strong financial incentives to correctly\nprice a firm’s risk. Since market prices of securities tend to be forward-looking, they reflect\ninvestors’ expectations given the current information.\n\nThere are several examples of how market signals could be incorporated into the regulatory\nprocess. For instance, if financial firms were required to issue subordinated debt, as I have just\ndiscussed, supervisors could monitor a bank’s subordinated debt spreads for indications of\nemerging risk and take appropriate actions in response. This strategy is supported by evidence\nthat subordinated debt spreads do increase with the risk profile of the issuers.\n\n7\n\n\fOthers have argued for using credit default swap spreads or market-based capital measures in\nthe supervisory process. In particular, the Federal Reserve has proposed using market signals in\nestablishing thresholds for “early remediation” under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nThe argument for greater use of market data in bank supervision is not that market signals are\nalways superior to supervisory assessments, but that market data can complement information\ngathered by examiners. There is still much to learn about how best to combine market data\nwith examiner data to improve supervisory assessments of risk in the financial system, and\nadditional research in this area could prove highly useful.\n\nOf course, if we want to effectively leverage market discipline, then we have to address the\nproblem of too big to fail. If creditors perceive they will be rescued, then market discipline is\nundermined and moral hazard will lead to greater risk-taking by the institutions. It is important\nto recognize that the moral hazard problem is not mitigated by eliminating the potential for\ngovernment support. It doesn’t matter where the money comes from to rescue creditors. Any\nmeans of providing an implicit or explicit subsidy to protect creditors undermines market\ndiscipline and creates moral hazard. Without an effective and credible resolution regime that\nensures no subsidies to creditors, there is less incentive for markets to monitor a firm’s risk –\nthus, the firm’s risk would not be accurately reflected in security prices.\n\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the existing authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation (FDIC) to resolve failing banks including those that are deemed systemically\nimportant. While the objective is to end too big to fail, I have argued that the reforms as\ncurrently envisioned are unlikely to do so. The expansive discretionary power given to the FDIC\nunder Title II could make it vulnerable to political pressure regarding the bailout of individual\ninstitutions or creditors. Keep in mind that Title II resolution is triggered only when there are\nconcerns about systemic risks. The discretionary aspect of Title II could cause creditors to\nperceive that their payoffs would be determined through a regulatory resolution process, in\n\n8\n\n\fwhich political pressure can be brought to bear, independent of the rule of law. Some have\nsuggested that there be a tax on the financial industry to provide support for the resolution\nscheme proposed by the FDIC. While this may get the taxpayer off the hook, it does not solve\nthe too-big-to-fail problem.\n\nOn a number of occasions, I have advocated a new bankruptcy mechanism suitable for all\nfinancial firms, whether systemically important or not, to alleviate most of the potential\nproblems caused by the discretionary and targeted nature of Title II.1 A bankruptcy process\ntailored for financial institutions would restore the incentives of market participants and\ncreditors, in particular, to monitor risk taking by these institutions. I find this a more appealing\nand effective path to ending too big to fail.\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, simplicity and transparency are important principles to enhance prudential\nstandards in financial regulations and financial stability. Simple, transparent regulatory\nmechanisms make it easier for market participants to predict how regulators are likely to\nbehave. This, in turn, makes it easier for regulators to credibly commit to implementing the\nregulations in a consistent manner, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the regulatory\nregime.\n\nAn increased role for simple regulatory mechanisms that are harder to evade – and even better,\nmechanisms that utilize market forces to discipline firm behavior – is superior to an everexpanding list of complex rules that seeks to cover every possible outcome. In many\ncircumstances, simpler and more transparent regulatory approaches, that also enhance the\neffectiveness of market discipline, can better achieve financial stability while maintaining a\ndynamic financial system that meets the needs of our economy.\n\n1\n\nSee Charles Plosser, “Reducing Financial Fragility by Ending Too Big to Fail,” speech before the Eighth Annual\nFinance Conference, Boston College Carroll School of Management , Boston, MA, June 6, 2013.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Your series of guest speakers over the years has been quite illustrious, and it has\nincluded many Federal Reserve governors and presidents, not to mention distinguished\neconomists and a wide array of others. So, before I share some thoughts on monetary policy\nwith you tonight, I will begin with the usual disclaimer that my views are my own and do not\nnecessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open\nMarket Committee (FOMC). Of course, that disclaimer is a two-way street, and you should not\nnecessarily associate the views of my colleagues with my views.\n\n1\n\n\fI believe that this diversity of views among FOMC participants does more than assure variety\namong your guest speakers. It is one of the great strengths of our decentralized central bank.\nOpen dialogue and diversity of views leads to better policy decisions and is the primary means\nby which new ideas are gradually incorporated into our monetary policy framework. Thus, I\nbelieve diversity of thought is a sign of thoughtful progress. As I noted in 2009 when I last\nspoke to you, the famous American journalist Walter Lippmann once said, “Where all men think\nalike, no one thinks very much.”\nTonight I would like to focus on a particular aspect of current monetary policy that has been a\nsource of much discussion and debate – forward guidance – that is, the practice of providing\ninformation on the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. Forward guidance has\ntaken on greater significance since the FOMC lowered the target federal funds rate to\nessentially zero more than five years ago. Facing this zero lower bound constraint on its\nprimary policy instrument, the FOMC has been attempting to implement monetary policy, in\npart, by influencing expectations of future policy. The logic for this approach derives from the\nimportant role expectations play in shaping economic outcomes. If monetary policy can affect\nthose expectations in specific ways, it can influence current economic conditions.\nThe approach I want to take in my discussion is to highlight the relationship between such\nforward guidance and systematic monetary policy. By systematic, I mean setting policy in a\nrule-like or largely predictable manner in response to changes in economic conditions. Forward\nguidance and systematic monetary policy are closely related. Understanding this relationship\ncan provide insights into effective monetary policy in both normal times and in more unusual or\nextreme circumstances, such as when policy is constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal\ninterest rates.\nSo, I will begin with a brief review of the benefits of systematic policy. I will highlight why I\nthink most academic economists have concluded that conducting monetary policy in a rule-like\nmanner is preferable to regimes that are more discretionary.\n2\n\n\fSystematic Policy\nFor someone my age, it doesn’t seem all that long ago when it was taken for granted that\ncentral banking was supposed to be mysterious and secretive — the less said about monetary\npolicy the better. Indeed, it wasn’t until 1994 that the FOMC began to publicly announce the\npolicy changes made at an FOMC meeting. Up until then, the markets were left to infer the\npolicy action from the Fed’s behavior in the market. 1\nBut times have most definitely changed. Transparency has replaced secrecy, and open\ncommunications have replaced mystery. While there are those who long for those thrilling\ndays of yesteryear when central bankers said little and communicated even less, I don’t think\nwe can turn back the clock — nor should we.\nEconomic science has come a long way in the past 30 years, and one of the most important\ndevelopments has been the recognition of the important role that expectations play in\nunderstanding economic outcomes. This is particularly evident in financial markets, where\ninvestment decisions and the valuation of securities depend on assessments of future economic\noutcomes. But this is also true for individuals buying homes and businesses making capital\ninvestments.\nWhen businesses and households have a better understanding of how monetary policy is likely\nto evolve, they can make more informed spending and financial decisions. If policymakers can\nreduce uncertainty about the course of monetary policy, the economy is likely to perform more\nefficiently. Thus, monetary policy that is more systematic and predictable can reduce\nexpectational errors and contribute to a more stable and efficiently functioning economy. This\nrecognition of the important role played by expectations has led many academics and\npolicymakers to stress the importance of credibility and commitment to well-articulated\nmonetary policy objectives. It has also led to extensive research on monetary policy rules that\ncan enhance the predictability of policy. In fact, virtually all of the mainstream macroeconomic\n1\n\nSee the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, “Timeline to Transparency,” www.philadelphiafed.org/about-thefed/transparency/ (accessed March 22, 2014).\n\n3\n\n\fmodels are built upon the presumption that monetary policy is conducted in a rule-like manner\nthat is well understood by all agents in the economy.\nIn their Nobel Prize-winning work, Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott demonstrated that a credible\ncommitment by policymakers to behave in a systematic, rule-like manner over time leads to\nbetter outcomes than discretion.2 In monetary policy, less discretionary behavior and a\ncommitment to a more systematic approach have been shown to lead to more economic\nstability – lower and less volatile inflation and less volatile output.\nYet, the science of monetary policy has not progressed to the point where we can specify the\noptimal rule for setting monetary policy and turn decisions over to a computer. Judgment is\nstill required. Moreover, optimal rules, that is, those that maximize economic welfare, are\nhighly dependent on the particular model from which they are derived. For example, the\noptimal rule for one model can produce very bad outcomes in another model. In addition,\noptimal rules can often be quite complex, thus making them difficult to implement and to\ncommunicate to the public. In other words, they may not be very transparent.\nHowever, these limitations to implementing optimal policy rules should not prevent us from\nadopting a systematic approach to the conduct of policy. There has been a great deal of\nprogress in identifying simple, robust rules that appear to perform well in a variety of models\nand environments. Such robust rules can form a basis for developing more systematic, rule-like\npolicymaking. This rule-like approach does not mean one can know the future or what future\npolicy decisions will be. You often hear policymakers speak of policy as being data dependent,\nand indeed, it is. But the data should feed into a systematic decision-making process so that\npolicy will be similar in similar environments. One way to think about this systematic part of\npolicy is as a reaction function with parameters that are largely stable over time.\n\n2\n\nFinn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott, “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,”\nJournal of Political Economy, 85 (January 1977), pp. 473–91.\n\n4\n\n\fOne important and desirable characteristic of such a reaction function is that it can be easily\narticulated to the public. This greatly improves the transparency and predictability of monetary\npolicy, which reduces surprises. Everyone is more informed about the course of monetary\npolicy because they understand how policymakers are likely to react to changing economic\ncircumstances.\nThe most well-known simple rule is that proposed by John Taylor in 1993.3 The Taylor rule calls\nfor setting the nominal fed funds rate based on three factors. The first represents the\neconomy’s long-run real interest rate, perhaps the steady-state real interest rate, plus the Fed’s\ntarget rate of inflation. This is sometimes referred to as the normal, or neutral, nominal rate of\ninterest.\nThe second factor is a function of the deviation of inflation from the central bank’s target or\ngoal. If inflation is above the target, the Taylor rule says the funds rate should be higher, and if\nit is below target, the funds rate should be lower. The third element in the Taylor rule calls for\nan adjustment of the funds rate to departures of real GDP from some measure of “potential”\nGDP. Simply put, when GDP is below “potential,” the funds rate should be reduced, and when\nit is above, it should increase.\nI will point out that our recent thresholds did not provide a reaction function. They simply\nsuggested a range of economic conditions under which we would not act. They conveyed\nnothing about our actions in other states of the economy. In my view, this was one of the\nmajor drawbacks to the approach and the reason changes were needed.\nOver the past 20 years, the Taylor rule has garnered a great deal of attention and study. Many\nvariations have been proposed and their properties investigated. Almost all the simple rules\nthat have been found to be robust over a range of models have very similar constructions and\ncan be expressed as variants of Taylor’s original specification. Of course, the Fed has never\n3\n\nJohn B. Taylor, “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Series on Public Policy, NorthHolland, 39, 1993, pp. 195–214.\n\n5\n\n\fadopted a formal reaction function or simple rule for setting monetary policy. But the FOMC\ndoes look at the implications of various rules for interest rates when it makes its policy\ndecisions.\nThe fact that the FOMC has not adopted a formal reaction function might reflect the desire for\ndiscretion on the part of some policymakers. But it also reflects the difficulty in reaching a\nconsensus. The Committee is composed of 19 members with varying views about how the\neconomy functions, the shocks affecting the economy, and how policy should be set to meet\nthe FOMC’s monetary policy goals. Despite not having formally adopted a particular rule, the\nFed appeared to behave in a systematic way at various times in the past. Indeed, Taylor’s 1993\narticle noted that his rule approximated Federal Reserve policy setting over the 1987–1992\nperiod, save for a deviation during the stock market crash of 1987.\nI believe that despite the challenges, there would be large benefits to the FOMC reaching a\nconsensus on a reaction function that could serve as a useful guide to understanding its\nbehavior. Those benefits would be in the form of increased transparency and in the alignment\nof the public’s expectations with policymakers’ intentions. As I’ve discussed before, there are\nlimitations to the use of simple rules, and no central bank can be constrained by one simple rule\nin all circumstances. Rules are basically intended to work well on average, but any central bank\nlooks at many variables in determining policy. There will be times when policy must deviate\nfrom a reaction function or policy rule. However, simple rules do provide valuable benchmarks\nfor assessing the appropriate stance of policy. They also provide guidance about the likely path\nof policy and thus are intended to reduce volatility. However, this outcome cannot happen\nunless the central bank is willing to publicly communicate a reaction function or rule.\nAnother benefit of articulating a rule is enhanced accountability. There will inevitably be times\nwhen economic developments fall outside the scope of our models and warrant unusual\nmonetary policy action. Events such as 9/11, the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of Lehman\nBrothers, and the 1987 stock market crash may require departures from the simple rule.\n6\n\n\fHaving articulated a rule guiding policymaking in normal times, the policymaker will be\nexpected to explain the departures from the rule in these unusual circumstances. With the rule\nas a baseline, departures can be quantified and inform us how excessively tight or easy policy\nmight be relative to normal. If the events are temporary, policymakers will have to explain how\nand when policy is likely to return to normal.\nThus, I see several benefits to the FOMC reaching a consensus on a reaction function or policy\nrule, including aligning expectations for policy and enhancing transparency and accountability\nof the policymaking process.\nForward Guidance\nOne way to think about the policy reaction function is as a form of forward guidance. Indeed, it\nis perhaps the best and most useful form of forward guidance.\nIn normal times, forward guidance provides the public with information about the expected\npath of policy. As I’ve discussed, forward guidance is a form of transparency that reduces\nvolatility by reducing policy uncertainty relative to discretionary decision-making.\nHowever, with the policy rate at or near zero, forward guidance can play a role in increasing the\ndegree of accommodation. When the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound, the\nfuture policy rate becomes potentially more important than the current policy rate in\ninfluencing current economic conditions through its impact on expectations. In some models,\nwhen faced with the zero lower bound, it can be desirable to indicate that future policy rates\nwill be kept lower for longer than might otherwise be the case.4 Thus, policymakers may want\nto deliberately commit to deviating from what they would otherwise choose to do under\nnormal conditions, such as following a Taylor-like rule or their normal reaction function. In\nthese models, such a commitment would tend to raise inflation expectations and lower longrun nominal rates, thereby inducing households and businesses to spend more today.\n4\n\nGauti B. Eggertsson and Michael Woodford, “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,”\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, 2003, pp. 139–211.\n\n7\n\n\fThis use of forward guidance asks more of policymakers than just articulating a reaction\nfunction. In a sense, it requires more of a commitment from policymakers; it requires them to\ncommit to a future path that will not be time consistent if policymakers were only forward\nlooking. Instead, policymakers need to commit to a policy path that is history dependent. As I\nnoted, you can think of this as a commitment to deviate from a prior reaction function,\nparticularly if that reaction function makes no provision for operating at the zero lower bound.\nIf such a commitment can be made credible, it can yield better economic outcomes. But\nmanaging the public’s beliefs about the future policy path is challenging if policymakers must\nconvince the public that they will not behave as they have in the past. And I would argue that\nthat is the circumstance that the FOMC faces. 5\nManaging expectations is even more challenging when policymakers have not been clear about\nthe reaction function they use in normal times. How can policymakers credibly commit to\ndeviate from something they have never committed to in the first place? How can\npolicymakers convey that they will be implementing policy that is more accommodative than\nnormal when they have not been clear about what would constitute the normal degree of\naccommodation?\nManaging the public’s expectations may be not only difficult but also counterproductive.\nWithout the public’s understanding of policymaking in normal times, trying to pursue a\ncommitment to looser-than-normal policy may send the wrong signal. For example, if the\npublic hears that the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret the message as\npolicymakers saying that they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If this is the\ninterpretation, then the forward guidance will weaken rather than strengthen current\nspending.\n\n5\n\nThis would not be the case if the reaction function or rule explicitly described how policy would be conducted at\nthe zero lower bound. In that case, new forward guidance would not be required, as the reaction function would\nhave already notified the public what to expect.\n\n8\n\n\fWhere Do We Go from Here?\nMy preference for dealing with forward guidance is for the FOMC to articulate a reaction\nfunction as best it can. This entails describing a systematic approach to policymaking where\npolicy decisions are based on available information in a consistent and predictable way. I\nbelieve the most recent FOMC statement took a step in this direction when we moved to a\nqualitative form of forward guidance by stating that we will be assessing progress – both\nrealized and expected – toward our policy objectives. The idea that policy will change as we\napproach our objectives has the flavor of a reaction function.\nBut, of course, there is more work to do. Because we do not know the true model of the\neconomy, I would suggest the Committee begin by considering a set of robust policy rules\ndesigned to have good results in a variety of models and across various stages of the business\ncycle. Such robust rules recognize that data are measured imprecisely and are subject to\nrevision.\nThese robust rules typically indicate that policy should respond to changes in the gap between\ninflation and the inflation goal, and to changes in the deviation of output from a measure of\npotential output, or to changes in unemployment from the steady-state or the natural rate of\nunemployment. Most robust rules suggest that the reaction to the changes in the inflation gap\nbe more than one-for-one and should exceed the reaction to changes in the output or\nunemployment gap. The rules also suggest that policy should be somewhat inertial. By\nrecognizing the fundamental difficulty in measuring potential output or the natural rate of\nunemployment, I think a good case can be made to consider rules that rely on the growth of\noutput or changes in the unemployment rate or employment growth.\nI want to stress that these rules suggest that policy should respond to changes in the output or\nunemployment gap not because policy is seeking to fine-tune the real economy but because\ndoing so allows the economy to efficiently use resources given the economic disturbances that\nit experiences.\n9\n\n\fBy considering such robust rules, the FOMC might be able to move toward a consensus on a\nqualitative description of its reaction function as an important first step. For example, we\nwould not have to specify the precise mathematical rule but would provide assessments of key\nvariables and then communicate our policy decisions in terms of changes in these key variables.\nIf policy were changed, then we would explain that change in terms of how the variables in our\nresponse function changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically use\nthem to describe our policy choices, the public will form more accurate judgments about the\nlikely course of policy – thereby reducing uncertainty and promoting stability.\nThe FOMC has kept the federal funds rate at effectively zero since December 2008. For much\nof this time, interest rate rules suggested that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates\nwas constraining policy; in other words, that nominal rates should be negative if that were\npossible. However, many robust rules now suggest that given the progress the economy has\nmade over the past year, policy either is no longer constrained or will soon not be constrained\nby the zero bound. That is, they indicate that the policy rate should be above zero.\nRule-based policymaking would require the FOMC to indicate how it plans to adjust policy to a\nmore normal stance. The Committee could decide to simply follow the prescriptions offered by\nthe reaction function. Or instead, the Committee might decide that normalization will be\ndelayed with a more gradual adjustment of rates relative to the prescriptions of the reaction\nfunction. But even if the FOMC were not prepared to choose a particular rule, it could\narticulate more clearly a qualitative reaction function that would serve as a baseline for future\nchanges in policy as we exit the zero lower bound. It is my belief that doing so would be a more\nunderstandable form of forward guidance, less subject to misinterpretation as policy transitions\nfrom unusual times to more normal times.\n\n10\n\n\f"

The Global Interdependence Center (GIC) has once again\norganized another opportunity to exchange views and discuss important topics on truly\nglobal issues.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Banque de France is in its third century, having been founded in 1800. Last week, I\nspoke in London, where the Bank of England has been operating since 1694. So, I\nhesitate to mention that the Federal Reserve is marking its 100th anniversary this year.\nThe Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created a uniquely American approach to a central\nbank – a decentralized central bank – with 12 independent Federal Reserve Banks\naround the country and a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This unique\ngovernance structure requires that I forewarn you that the views I express are my own\nand do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy is now nearly five years into a recovery that began in June 2009. The\nrecovery has been lackluster in many ways, yet it has made considerable progress\nnonetheless. The unemployment rate, for example, has fallen from its peak of 10.0\npercent to 6.7 percent. Employment gains have restored some 8 million jobs since the\ntrough, representing more than 90 percent of the jobs lost since the peak. Stock prices\nhave recovered, housing prices are up, and earnings at many businesses are healthy. It\nis my general view that the U.S. economy is on firmer footing today than it has been in\nseveral years. This is a cause for some optimism for continued progress in 2014.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a blizzard of economic reports, which have come in\nweaker than expected. I believe that weakness largely reflects the severe winter\nweather rather than a frozen recovery. So, we must be wary of attaching too much\nsignificance to the latest numbers. As a monetary policymaker, I prefer to take a longer\nview rather than let our decisions be whipsawed by the most recent statistics, which are\noften noisy and subject to revision. Because monetary policy tends to work with a lag,\nwe must keep our attention focused on the intermediate- to longer-term underlying\ntrends if we are to make wise decisions.\nBased on the latest GDP numbers revised last month, the U.S. economy performed\n2\n\n\fnoticeably better in the second half of 2013 than in the first half. Specifically, real\noutput grew at a 3.3 percent pace in the second half of the year compared with 1.8\npercent in the first half.\nWhile this is far from the robust growth that many would like to see, it continues to\nrepresent steady progress and an improving economy. My forecast calls for about 3\npercent growth in 2014. This is in line with the central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent\ngrowth reported by my colleagues on the FOMC in December 2013.\nThere has been discussion of some recent weakness in consumer spending, housing\nstarts, and housing sales. For instance, in January, total retail sales fell by 0.4 percent;\nhousing starts dropped sharply in January by 2 percent compared with the level of a\nyear ago; and existing home sales dropped about 5 percent from a year ago. While\nsome softening in home sales might be expected from the rise in mortgage rates, those\nrates are still very low by historical standards, and new home sales surged in January,\nrising to their highest level since 2008. Despite the mixed housing data, continued\nhousehold formation constitutes a source of growth in housing demand. So, I expect\nthat housing will continue its recovery in 2014, once we get past the severe weather.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP, proved to be\nquite resilient in 2013, despite the rise in payroll taxes at the start of the year, a\ngovernment shutdown, significant uncertainties about future tax policy, and the\nimplications of health-care reform.\nGoing forward, I expect that there will be less fiscal drag on the economy in 2014 than\nwe saw in 2013. Moreover, rising home prices and stock prices have helped improve\nconsumer balance sheets. I have frequently noted that one reason for the less-thanrobust growth in consumption during this recovery has been the deleveraging efforts by\nconsumers. With consumers carrying too much debt, spending was inevitably going to\ngive way to more saving as consumers attempted to restore the health of their balance\nsheets. That process has been playing out, and the drag from deleveraging is waning. In\n3\n\n\faddition, steady, moderate job growth has led to modest increases in income. I foresee\nsomewhat more robust spending by consumers in the coming year as these trends\ncontinue.\nWeather also affected recent manufacturing numbers in the U.S. The Philadelphia Fed’s\nBusiness Outlook Survey of manufacturers in our region has been a reliable indicator of\nnational manufacturing trends in the U.S. In February, the diffusion index of current\nactivity fell into negative territory for the first time in nine months. However, most\nrespondents attributed the weakness to the severe winter weather. Consistent with\nsuch comments, expectations for manufacturing activity six months ahead increased in\nFebruary.\nOn the job front, the February employment report posted payroll gains of 175,000 jobs,\nfollowing an increase of 129,000 jobs in January, and 84,000 in December. All three of\nthese numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter\nweather.\nAs we look at the employment averages over several months, the news remains\npositive. Based on the latest revision, firms added an average of 194,000 jobs per\nmonth in 2013, which is a somewhat better pace than in 2012. This consistent pace of\njob growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in February,\nwhich is a full percentage point lower than a year ago. I expect that the unemployment\nrate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014, and, if anything, that may prove\ntoo pessimistic. Given the recent trends, an unemployment rate below 6 percent is\ncertainly plausible.\nIn terms of the other part of the Fed’s mandate, inflation has been running somewhat\nbelow the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation\nis the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nor PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year. It is important to defend our 2\npercent inflation target both from below and above. Yet, I anticipate, as the FOMC\n4\n\n\findicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our target\nover time. Economic growth is firming, and some of the factors that have held inflation\ndown, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare providers, are likely to abate\nover time.\nAn additional and important determinant of actual inflation is consumer and business\nexpectations of inflation. I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their\nlonger-term averages and consistent with our 2 percent target. Given the large amount\nof monetary accommodation that we have added and continue to add to the economy, I\nthink there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. While there continues to be some\ndownside risk to growth, for the first time in years, I see the potential for more upside\nrisk to the economic outlook. We need to consider this possibility as we calibrate\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some issues for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has taken\nextraordinary policy actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its\npolicy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero, where it has been for more\nthan five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to\nprovide additional accommodation through large-scale asset purchases. We are now in\nour third round of this quantitative easing.\nSince September 2012, the FOMC has added about $1.3 trillion in long-term Treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet through this program, buying at a\npace of $85 billion a month in 2013. This program, known as QE3, is already twice the\nsize of the last round of asset purchases initiated in November 2010, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of\npurchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. In January, it announced a further\n5\n\n\freduction to $65 billion. The FOMC is now on a path of measured reductions, which, if\ncontinued, will end the purchase program later this year. If the economy continues to\nimprove, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an\nenvironment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the\nopposite direction.\nIn addition to asset purchases, the Fed is using forward guidance as a policy tool, which\nis intended to inform the public about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the\nfuture. In this dimension, the FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate\nnear zero well past the time that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent\nthreshold. The FOMC had previously indicated that this was the earliest point at which\nit would consider raising interest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent target.\nEven though the FOMC has said that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the\neconomy crosses that threshold, I believe that with the economy so close to the\nunemployment threshold, we face a communications challenge. In particular, we have\nnot described how policy will be conducted after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5\npercent.\nCommunication Challenges\nBut before we offer further forward guidance, it is important to be clear about what this\nforward guidance is supposed to accomplish. As that famous American baseball player\nYogi Berra is reported to have said, “You have to be careful if you don’t know where\nyou’re going because you might end up somewhere else.”\nOne way to think of forward guidance is that it is just another step toward increased\ntransparency and effective communication of monetary policy. This approach seeks to\nclarify how policymakers will alter policy as economic conditions change, that is, to\ndescribe a reaction function. By being more transparent about how policy will evolve as\n\n6\n\n\fa function of economic conditions, this approach can help the public form more\naccurate expectations about the future path of monetary policy.\nEconomists have learned that expectations play an important role in determining\neconomic outcomes. When businesses and households have a better understanding of\nhow monetary policy is likely to evolve, they can make more informed spending and\nfinancial decisions. If policymakers can reduce uncertainty about the course of\nmonetary policy, the economy is likely to perform more efficiently.\nOf course, in order to communicate something about the reaction function, you have to\nhave one. That means in order to succeed with this approach to forward guidance,\npolicymakers must be able to agree on how they will systematically respond to changes\nin economic conditions. To be useful, however, the reaction function need not be\nmechanistic. Qualitative information about such a function and how it will be\nimplemented can also be useful and meaningful. Nevertheless, some degree of\ncommitment to abide by the specified reaction function is necessary if the\ncommunication is to achieve the desired result of reducing policy uncertainty and\nproviding meaningful forward guidance.\nA somewhat different rationale or view of forward guidance is that it is a way of\nincreasing accommodation when the policy rate is at or near the zero lower bound.\nSome models suggest that when you are at the zero lower bound, it can be desirable, or\noptimal, to indicate that future policy rates will be kept “lower for longer” than might\notherwise be the case. Thus, policymakers may want to deliberately commit to\ndeviating from what they would otherwise choose to do under normal conditions, such\nas following a Taylor-like rule. In these models, such a commitment would tend to raise\ninflation expectations and lower long-term nominal rates, thereby inducing households\nand businesses to spend more today.\nThis approach asks more of forward guidance than just articulating a reaction function.\nIt takes more credibility and commitment because it requires policymakers to directly\n7\n\n\finfluence and manage the public’s beliefs about the future policy path that differs from\nhow policymakers behaved in the past. As I have indicated in previous speeches, this\napproach to forward guidance can backfire if the policy is misunderstood. 1 For example,\nif the public hears that the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret this news\nas policymakers saying that they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If that is\nthe interpretation of the message, then the forward guidance will not succeed and may\neven weaken current spending.\nThe FOMC has not been clear about the purpose of its forward guidance. Is it purely a\ntransparency device, or is it a way to commit to a more accommodative future policy\nstance to add more accommodation today? This lack of clarity makes it difficult to\ncommunicate the stance of policy and the conditionality of policy on the state of the\neconomy.\nI believe there is another – perhaps more fundamental – tension underlying forward\nguidance and communication. Forward guidance in either of the two approaches I have\ndiscussed requires a degree of commitment to conduct future policy in some particular\nmanner. Commitment is central to the success of either approach. Yet, I would suggest\nthat the old “rules versus discretion” debate is alive and well. This, of course, is not a\nnew tension within the FOMC, nor is it one that is likely to go away in the near term.\nBut the heightened weight and prominence given to forward guidance as a policy tool\nhas certainly shined a spotlight on this longstanding debate.\nThe desire to maintain flexibility to respond to “events on the ground” is a strong one.\nOne can make the case that discretion is deeply ingrained in most policy institutions,\nparticularly the Fed. Yet, the desire to maintain discretion is anathema to the\ncommitment required for successful forward guidance. Policymakers cannot maintain\ndiscretion and simultaneously commit to forward guidance and expect that guidance to\nbe effective.\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy\nResearch’s (SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve at a moderate\npace. We are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor\nmarkets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue to\ndecline, reaching 6.2 percent or lower by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation\nexpectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2\npercent over the next year.\nOn monetary policy, we must back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace\nmay leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to\nthe FOMC forecasts.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis.\nLet me conclude with this thought. Over the past five years, the Fed and, dare I say,\nmany other central banks have become much more interventionist. I do not think this is\na particularly healthy state of affairs for the central banks or our economies. The crisis\nin the U.S. has long passed. With a growing economy and the Fed’s long-term asset\npurchases coming to an end, now is the time to contemplate restoring some semblance\nof normalcy to monetary policy.\nIn my view, the proper role for monetary policy is to work behind the scenes in limited\nand systematic ways to promote long-term growth and price stability. But since the\nonset of the financial crisis, central banks have become highly interventionist in their\nefforts to manipulate asset prices and financial markets in general as they attempt to\n9\n\n\ffine-tune economic outcomes. This approach has continued well past the end of the\nfinancial crisis. While the motivations may be noble, we have created an environment\nwhere “it is all about the Fed.” Market participants focus entirely too much on how the\ncentral bank may tweak its policy, and central bankers have become too sensitive and\ndesirous of managing prices in the financial world. I do not see this as a healthy\nsymbiotic relationship for the long term.\nIf financial market participants believe that their success depends primarily on the next\ndecisions of monetary policymakers rather than economic fundamentals, our capital\nmarkets will cease to deliver the economic benefits they are capable of providing. And\nif central banks do not limit their interventionist strategies and focus on returning to\nmore normal policymaking aimed at promoting price stability and long-term growth,\nthen they will simply encourage the financial markets to ignore fundamentals and to\nfocus, instead, on the next actions of the central bank.\nI hope we can find a way to normalize the role of monetary policy to one that is less\ninterventionist, less discretionary, and more systematic. I believe our longer-term\neconomic health will be the beneficiary.\n\n10\n\n\f"

The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum is a relatively new\norganization, yet it is already establishing itself as an important venue for the exchange\nof views and ideas among policymakers and the private sector. It is similar to the Global\nInterdependence Center, a think tank based in Philadelphia, which is hosting a\nconference at the Banque de France next week, where I will join my friend Governor\nChristian Noyer. I note with interest that Governor Noyer will be speaking to you in just\na few weeks’ time.\n\n1\n\n\fOur venue today has an impressive history. The Worshipful Company of Armourers and\nBrasiers has been operating at this location since 1346. That is nearly 350 years before\nthe Bank of England was founded in 1694. Its original building survived the Great Fire of\n1666, and this current building survived the 1940 Blitz. With so much history steeped in\nthese halls, I hesitate to mention that the Federal Reserve is marking its 100th\nanniversary this year. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created a uniquely American\napproach to a central bank – a decentralized central bank – with 12 independent\nFederal Reserve Banks around the country and a Board of Governors in Washington,\nD.C. This unique governance structure requires that I forewarn you that the views I\nexpress are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System\nor my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\nEconomic Conditions\nThe U.S. economy is now nearly five years into a recovery that began in June 2009. The\nrecovery has been lackluster in many ways, yet it has made considerable progress\nnonetheless. The unemployment rate, for example, has fallen from its peak of 10.0\npercent to 6.6 percent. Employment gains have restored some 7.8 million jobs since the\ntrough, representing about 90 percent of the jobs lost since the peak. Stock prices have\nrecovered, housing prices are up, and earnings at many businesses are healthy. It is my\ngeneral view that the U.S. economy is on firmer footing today than it has been in several\nyears. This is a cause for some optimism for continued progress in 2014.\nIn recent weeks, there has been a blizzard of economic reports, which have come in\nweaker than expected. I believe that weakness largely reflects the severe winter\nweather rather than a frozen recovery. So, we must be wary of attaching too much\nsignificance to the latest numbers. As a monetary policymaker, I prefer to take a longer\nview rather than let our decisions be whipsawed by the most recent statistics, which are\noften noisy and subject to revision. Because monetary policy tends to work with a lag,\nwe must keep our attention focused on the intermediate- to longer-term underlying\ntrends if we are to make wise decisions.\n2\n\n\fBased on the latest GDP numbers revised last week, the U.S. economy performed\nnoticeably better in the second half of 2013 than in the first half. Specifically, real\noutput grew at a 3.3 percent pace in the second half of the year compared with 1.8\npercent in the first half.\nWhile this is far from the robust growth that many would like to see, it continues to\nrepresent steady progress and an improving economy. My forecast calls for about 3\npercent growth in 2014. This is in line with the central tendency of 2.8 to 3.2 percent\ngrowth reported by my colleagues on the FOMC in December 2013.\nThere has been discussion of some recent weakness in consumer spending, housing\nstarts, and housing sales.

Based on the latest revision, firms added an average of 194,000 jobs per\nmonth in 2013, which is a somewhat better pace than in 2012. This consistent pace of\njob growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.6 percent in January. I\nexpect that the unemployment rate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014,\nand, if anything, that may prove too pessimistic. Given the recent trends, an\nunemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.\nIn terms of the other part of the Fed’s mandate, inflation has been running somewhat\nbelow the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation\nis the year-over-year change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures,\nor PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year.

While there continues to be some\ndownside risk to growth, for the first time in years, I see the potential for more upside\nrisk to the economic outlook. We need to consider this possibility as we calibrate\nmonetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nSo let me turn to some issues for monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has taken\nextraordinary policy actions to support the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its\npolicy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero, where it has been for more\nthan five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to\nprovide additional accommodation through large-scale asset purchases. We are now in\nour third round of this quantitative easing.\nSince September 2012, the FOMC has added about $1.3 trillion in long-term Treasuries\nand mortgage-backed securities to its balance sheet through this program, buying at a\npace of $85 billion a month in 2013. This program, known as QE3, is already twice the\nsize of the last round of asset purchases initiated in November 2010, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of\npurchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month. In January, it announced a further\nreduction to $65 billion. The FOMC is now on a path of measured reductions, which, if\n5\n\n\fcontinued, will end the purchase program later this year. If the economy continues to\nimprove, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an\nenvironment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the\nopposite direction.\nIn addition to asset purchases, the Fed is using forward guidance as a policy tool, which\nis intended to inform the public about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the\nfuture.

The FOMC had previously indicated that this was the earliest point at which\nit would consider raising interest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run\nbelow the Committee’s 2 percent target.\nEven though the FOMC has said that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the\neconomy crosses that threshold, I believe that with the economy so close to the\nunemployment threshold, we face a communications challenge. In particular, we have\nnot described how policy will be conducted after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5\npercent.\nCommunication Challenges\nBut before we offer further forward guidance, it is important to be clear about what this\nforward guidance is supposed to accomplish.

Is it purely a\ntransparency device, or is it a way to commit to a more accommodative future policy\nstance to add more accommodation today? This lack of clarity makes it difficult to\ncommunicate the stance of policy and the conditionality of policy on the state of the\neconomy.\nI believe there is another – perhaps more fundamental – tension underlying forward\nguidance and communication. Forward guidance in either of the two approaches I have\ndiscussed requires a degree of commitment to conduct future policy in some particular\nmanner. Commitment is central to the success of either approach. Yet, I would suggest\nthat the old “rules versus discretion” debate is alive and well. This, of course, is not a\nnew tension within the FOMC, nor is it one that is likely to go away in the near term.\nBut the heightened weight and prominence given to forward guidance as a policy tool\nhas certainly shined a spotlight on this longstanding debate.\nThe desire to maintain flexibility to respond to “events on the ground” is a strong one.\nOne can make the case that discretion is deeply ingrained in most policy institutions,\nparticularly the Fed. Yet, the desire to maintain discretion is anathema to the\ncommitment required for successful forward guidance. Policymakers cannot maintain\ndiscretion and simultaneously commit to forward guidance and expect that guidance to\nbe effective.\n\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy\nResearch’s (SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve at a moderate\npace. We are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor\nmarkets will continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue to\ndecline, reaching 6.2 percent or lower by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation\nexpectations will be relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2\npercent over the next year.\nOn monetary policy, we must back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace\nmay leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to\nthe FOMC forecasts.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis.\nLet me conclude with this thought. Over the past five years, the Fed and, dare I say,\nmany other central banks have become much more interventionist. I do not think this is\na particularly healthy state of affairs for the central banks or our economies. The crisis\nin the U.S. has long passed. With a growing economy and the Fed’s long-term asset\npurchases coming to an end, now is the time to contemplate restoring some semblance\nof normalcy to monetary policy.\nIn my view, the proper role for monetary policy is to work behind the scenes in limited\nand systematic ways to promote long-term growth and price stability. But since the\nonset of the financial crisis, central banks have become highly interventionist in their\nefforts to manipulate asset prices and financial markets in general as they attempt to\n9\n\n\ffine-tune economic outcomes. This approach has continued well past the end of the\nfinancial crisis. While the motivations may be noble, we have created an environment\nwhere “it is all about the Fed.” Market participants focus entirely too much on how the\ncentral bank may tweak its policy, and central bankers have become too sensitive and\ndesirous of managing prices in the financial world. I do not see this as a healthy\nsymbiotic relationship for the long term.\nIf financial market participants believe that their success depends primarily on the next\ndecisions of monetary policymakers rather than economic fundamentals, our capital\nmarkets will cease to deliver the economic benefits they are capable of providing. And\nif central banks do not limit their interventionist strategies and focus on returning to\nmore normal policymaking aimed at promoting price stability and long-term growth,\nthen they will simply encourage the financial markets to ignore fundamentals and to\nfocus, instead, on the next actions of the central bank.\nI hope we can find a way to normalize the role of monetary policy to one that is less\ninterventionist, less discretionary, and more systematic. I believe our longer-term\neconomic health will be the beneficiary.\n\n10\n\n\f"

The organizers have put together another great and\ntimely program with distinguished participants. However, with Governor Stein and Presidents\nKocherlakota, Evans, and myself all here, I am beginning to wonder if we are in Washington\nrather than in New York. Nevertheless, it is great to be on the program with so many of my\nfellow policymakers. If you listen carefully to each of us, you will understand why I start with\nthe usual caveat that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n1\n\n\fCommunication and transparency have been important themes in monetary policy discussions\nover the past decade or more. Indeed, in 2007 this Monetary Policy Forum began with Alan\nBlinder’s keynote address titled “Making Monetary Policy and Talking about It.” In part, this\nemphasis on communication and transparency reflects the steady evolution in the theory and\nscience of monetary policy. Reflecting this emerging consensus, the Federal Reserve during the\ntenure of Chairman Bernanke has taken a number of actions to promote increased\ntransparency about its actions and policies. In fact, President Evans and I served on a\nsubcommittee led by current Chair Yellen specifically focused on improving communication.\nOur efforts to improve communication took on heightened importance as the FOMC responded\nto the financial crisis and recession. Since December 2008, the federal funds rate target has\nbeen near zero. Since the nominal funds rate cannot go below zero, we had to develop\nalternative policy tools in an effort to provide further accommodation to support the recovery.\nWe also had to figure out how and what to communicate about these new tools. Thus, wellunderstood communication practices about traditional policy tools gave way to untested ways\nto describe these new tools. The task was further complicated because one of the\nunconventional tools was so-called forward guidance. Forward guidance seeks to inform the\npublic about the future path of policy rather than describing a policy action taken today. Thus,\neffective forward guidance is all about communication and what it conveys or doesn’t convey.\nIn my brief time today, I will focus on why I think communication is such a challenge and discuss\nsome of the choices the Committee faces going forward.\nCurrent State of Affairs\nFirst, communication is difficult because monetary policy is more complicated than it used to\nbe. With the traditional policy tool at the zero lower bound, the Committee has focused on two\nunconventional tools. The first is the purchase of long-term assets, and the second, as I\nmentioned, is forward guidance. The asset purchase program has had many dimensions, such\nas the overall volume of purchases, the pace of purchases, the kinds of assets targeted for\npurchase, and the criteria for starting and stopping the purchases. Policymakers have tried to\n2\n\n\ffine-tune the program along each dimension while assessing the trade-offs among them and\nthe trade-offs with other policy tools, such as the traditional funds rate decision. With so many\nmoving parts to our policy framework, it is not surprising that communication is very\ncomplicated.\nWe are now in the third round of asset purchases, or quantitative easing. Since September\n2012, the FOMC has added some $1.3 trillion in long-term Treasuries and mortgage-backed\nsecurities to its balance sheet through this program, buying at a pace of $85 billion a month in\n2013. This program, known as QE3, is already twice the size of the last round of asset\npurchases that was initiated in November 2010, known as QE2.\nIn December 2013, the Committee announced that it would reduce the pace of purchases from\n$85 billion to $75 billion per month. In January, it announced a further reduction to $65 billion.\nThe FOMC is now on a path of measured reductions, which, if continued, will end the purchase\nprogram late this year. If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying\nto increase accommodation in an environment when history suggests that policy should\nperhaps be moving in the opposite direction.\nCommunication about the future path of asset purchases has, at times, been imprecise and\nconfusing. Last June, the Committee suggested that it might begin to reduce the pace of\npurchases in the fall and perhaps end them when the unemployment rate reached 7 percent.\nHowever, the Committee did not even begin the tapering process until unemployment had\nreached 7 percent. It now seems unlikely that the program will end until the unemployment\nrate is below – or as indicated in the FOMC statement, perhaps “well below” – 6.5 percent.\nWhy is the 6.5 percent unemployment rate important? Because the Committee made it\nimportant. The Committee, in essence, told the markets that the 6.5 percent unemployment\nrate was an important quantitative marker. In December 2012, the FOMC indicated that it\nintended to keep the federal funds rate target near zero at least as long as the unemployment\nrate was above 6.5 percent, the inflation rate between one and two years ahead was projected\nto be no more than 2.5 percent, and inflation expectations remained well anchored. However,\n3\n\n\fit is important to remember that these guideposts were thresholds, not triggers. The FOMC\nhad not made a commitment to act once a threshold was reached, nor did it indicate how\npolicy would evolve after a threshold was reached. It simply signaled that it would not act prior\nto crossing one of the thresholds.\nYet, the 6.5 percent threshold will soon become irrelevant, and it probably is already. So the\nCommittee, at a minimum, has to revamp its communications regarding the future federal\nfunds rate path. Given that we are still easing policy by buying assets, it is pretty clear that\neven though the threshold will soon come and go, the Committee is unlikely to contemplate\nraising rates as long as it is buying assets. Put another way, the practical constraint at this point\nfor raising the policy rate is no longer the unemployment rate but the fact that we are still\nbuying assets. Indeed, the Committee has acknowledged that it will likely be appropriate to\nkeep rates at their current low rates well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5 percent.\nTherefore, in my view, the threshold has already lost its meaning as a guidepost. It needs to be\nreplaced with something that is more relevant and informative.\nThis poses the challenge of how and what to communicate about policy going forward. Our\nactions and the data have made the current form of forward guidance outdated and mostly\nirrelevant. Indeed, one could reasonably wonder whether the inflation threshold has any\nmeaning at this point. In other words, by allowing the unemployment threshold to pass\nwithout taking action, the public might conclude that the Committee could easily decide to let\nthe inflation threshold pass without taking action as well.\nCompeting Roles for Forward Guidance\nBefore we offer further forward guidance, it is important to be clear about what this forward\nguidance is intended to accomplish. As Yogi Berra is reported to have said, “You have to be\ncareful if you don’t know where you’re going because you might end up somewhere else.”\nOne way to think of forward guidance is that it is just another step toward increased\ntransparency and effective communication of monetary policy. This approach seeks to clarify\nhow policymakers will alter policy as economic conditions change, that is, to describe a reaction\n4\n\n\ffunction. By being more transparent about how policy will evolve as a function of economic\nconditions, this approach can help the public form more accurate expectations about the future\npath of monetary policy.\nEconomists have learned that expectations play an important role in determining economic\noutcomes. When businesses and households have a better understanding of how monetary\npolicy is likely to evolve, they can make more informed spending and financial decisions. If\nmonetary policymakers can reduce uncertainty about the course of monetary policy, the\neconomy is likely to perform more efficiently.\nOf course, in order to communicate something about the reaction function, you have to have\none. That means in order to be successful with this approach to forward guidance,\npolicymakers must be able to agree on how they will systematically respond to changes in\neconomic conditions. To be useful, however, the reaction function need not be mechanistic.\nQualitative information about such a function and how it will be implemented can also be\nuseful and meaningful. Nevertheless, some degree of commitment to abide by the specified\nreaction function is necessary, if the communication is to achieve the desired result of reducing\npolicy uncertainty and providing meaningful forward guidance. The excuse that “this time is\ndifferent” undermines the commitment and the credibility of the information that the\ncommunication is seeking to provide. I would add that a committed and credible approach to\nsuch a systematic approach to policy is helpful and informative regardless of whether you are at\nthe zero lower bound or not.\nA somewhat different rationale or view of forward guidance is that it is a way of increasing\naccommodation in a period when the policy rate is at or near the zero lower bound. Some\nmodels suggest that when you are at the zero lower bound, it can be desirable, or optimal, to\nindicate that future policy rates will be kept “lower for longer” than might otherwise be the\ncase. Thus, policymakers intentionally commit to deviating from what they would otherwise\nchoose to do in normal times, such as following the Taylor rule. In these models, such a\ncommitment would tend to raise inflation expectations and lower long-term nominal rates,\nthereby inducing households and businesses to spend more today.\n5\n\n\fThis approach asks more of forward guidance than just articulating a reaction function. It takes\nmore credibility and commitment because it requires policymakers to directly influence and\nmanage the public’s beliefs about the future policy path in ways that are different from how\nthey may have behaved in the past. As I have indicated in previous speeches, this approach to\nforward guidance can backfire if the policy is misunderstood. 1 For example, if the public hears\nthat the policy rate will be lower for longer, it may interpret this news as policymakers saying\nthat they expect the economy to be weaker for longer. If that is the interpretation of the\nmessage, then the forward guidance will not succeed and may even weaken current spending.\nThe FOMC has not been clear about the purpose of its forward guidance. Is it purely a\ntransparency device, or is it a way to commit to a more accommodative future policy stance to\nadd more accommodation today? This lack of clarity makes it difficult to communicate the\nstance of policy and the conditionality of policy on the state of the economy.\nNote that most formulations of standard, simple policy rules suggest that the federal funds rate\nshould rise very soon – if not already. In other words, the zero lower bound no longer appears\nto be binding. However, the FOMC has provided forward guidance indicating that the federal\nfunds rate will need to be low for some time to come.\nHow do we reconcile this apparent incongruity? It could be that the FOMC is using its forward\nguidance as a commitment device or signal for a more accommodative policy well into the\nfuture, as in the second approach I have discussed. Or, it could be the FOMC views forward\nguidance as a device for increased transparency but that it doesn’t think the standard rules\napply in the current environment. Then what rules do apply? If policymakers are not relying on\na rule or a rule-like reaction function, policy is purely discretionary and forward guidance\nbecomes ineffective. In either case, we have an opportunity and an obligation to provide more\ntransparency and better communication.\n\n1\n\nSee Charles I. Plosser, “Forward Guidance,” speech to the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research’s\n(SIEPR) Associates Meeting, February 12, 2013, Stanford, CA\n\n6\n\n\fThis leads me to suggest that there is a more fundamental tension underlying our forward\nguidance and communication challenges. Forward guidance in either of the two approaches\nthat I have discussed requires a degree of commitment to conduct future policy in some\nparticular manner. That commitment is central to the success of either approach. Yet, I would\nsuggest that the old “rules versus discretion” debate is alive and well. This, of course, is not a\nnew tension within the FOMC, nor is it one that is likely to go away in the near term. But the\nheightened weight and prominence given to forward guidance as a policy tool has certainly\nshined a spotlight on this longstanding debate.\nThe desire to maintain flexibility to respond to “events on the ground” is a strong one. One can\nmake the case that discretion is deeply ingrained in most policy institutions, particularly the\nFed. Yet, the desire to maintain discretion is anathema to the commitment required for\nsuccessful forward guidance. Policymakers cannot maintain discretion and simultaneously\ncommit to forward guidance and expect that guidance to be effective.\nSo, I conclude as I began: Forward guidance and clear communications remain important\nchallenges for monetary policymakers.\n\n7\n\n\f"

This is a great event for the region and I am pleased to see it grow year after\nyear.\n1\n\n\fI would like to begin my remarks this morning with a bit of history. We are observing\nthe 100th anniversary of the Federal Reserve and that gives me the opportunity, or the\nexcuse, to offer a perspective on this important, but sometimes misunderstood,\ninstitution. I should note that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those\nof the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nOn December 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed the act that created the\nFederal Reserve System, and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks opened their doors on\nNovember 16, 1914. I have often described the Federal Reserve as a uniquely American\nform of a central bank – a decentralized central bank. To understand why, we need to\nconsider two earlier attempts at central banking in the United States. Just a few blocks\nfrom the Philadelphia Fed’s present building on Independence Mall, you will find the\nvestiges of both institutions, dating back to the early years when Philadelphia was the\nmajor financial and political center of the country.\nAlexander Hamilton, our first secretary of the Treasury, championed the First Bank of\nthe United States to help our young nation manage its financial affairs. The First Bank\nreceived a 20-year charter from Congress and operated from 1791 to 1811. Although\nthis charter was not renewed, the War of 1812 and the ensuing inflation and economic\nturmoil convinced Congress to establish the Second Bank of the United States, which\noperated from 1816 to 1836. However, Congress could not override the veto of\nPresident Andrew Jackson, and the Second Bank’s charter also lapsed. Both institutions\nfailed to overcome the public’s mistrust of centralized power and special interests.\nNearly 80 years later, Congress tried again. To balance political, economic, and\ngeographic interests, Congress created a Federal Reserve System of 12 regional Reserve\nBanks with oversight provided by a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This\ndecentralized central bank was structured to overcome concerns that its actions would\nbe dominated either by political interests in Washington or by financial interests on Wall\nStreet.\n2\n\n\fThese 12 Reserve Banks perform several roles. They distribute currency, act as a\nbankers’ bank, and generally perform the functions of a central bank, which includes\nserving as the bank for the U.S. Treasury. They also play a critical role in supervising\nmany banks and bank holding companies across the country.\nEach Reserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors selected in a nonpartisan way\nto represent a cross-section of banking, commercial, and community interests. Pat\nHarker, president of the University of Delaware, serves on our board. These directors\nfulfill the traditional governance role, but they also provide valuable insights into\neconomic and financial conditions, which contribute to our assessment of the economy.\nThe Reserve Banks seek to stay in touch with Main Street in other ways. Some have\nBranch boards, and all have advisory councils. Reserve Banks also collect and analyze\ndata and conduct surveys of economic activity. This rich array of information and the\ndiverse views from across the country help policymakers paint a mosaic of the economy\nthat is essential as we formulate national monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the\nsystem with a number of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the\nFOMC has included the seven Governors in Washington, who are appointed by the\nPresident of the United States and confirmed by the Senate, as well as the president of\nthe New York Fed, and four other Reserve Bank presidents who serve one-year terms as\nmembers on a rotating basis.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings each\nyear to set monetary policy. The first one in 2014 was held just two weeks ago. In\nnormal times, the Committee votes to adjust short-term interest rates to achieve the\ngoals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us.\n3\n\n\fCongress spelled out the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\ninterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in\nthe long run.\nEconomic Conditions\nIn order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the\nFOMC must monitor and assess economic developments. So, let me turn to an\nassessment of our economy as we enter 2014.\nIn a nutshell, my view is that the economy is on firmer footing than it has been for the\npast several years. So let’s look at some of the details of how last year ended and the\nimplications for the coming year.\nReal output grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of last year,\nfollowing a 4.1 percent growth rate in the third quarter. That means economic growth\ndoubled in the second half of 2013 compared with the first half. Consumer spending\nand business investment in equipment ended the year with strong increases. Inventory\ninvestment and net exports also contributed to growth. On the other side of the ledger,\na decline in residential investment and a sharp decrease in federal government spending\nsubtracted from growth in the fourth quarter of the year. Going forward, I expect that\nthere will be less fiscal drag in 2014 than we saw in 2013 and that housing will continue\nits recovery.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an\nannual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest personal consumption\n4\n\n\fgrowth rate since fourth quarter 2010. Rising house prices and stock prices have helped\nimprove consumer balance sheets, and steady job growth has added to wage and salary\ngrowth, all of which have supported spending.\nOn the job front, the January employment report showed payroll gains of 113,000 jobs,\nfollowing an increase of 75,000 jobs in December, which was below many analysts’\nexpectations. Yet, these numbers were affected by the unseasonably cold and snowy\nweather. Indeed, winter weather has continued to be unusually disruptive, and that is\nmaking it difficult to assess underlying economic trends. I suspect it may be another\ncouple of months before we have a better read on the economy – hopefully the\nweather will turn better before that!\nWe have to remember that these employment numbers are subject to revisions, and\nsuch revisions can be significant. For instance, in the latest report the November jobs\nnumber was revised up by 33,000, from 241,000 to 274,000, while the December\nnumber was also revised up by 1,000 to 75,000.\nBecause of month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too much\ninto the most recent numbers but, instead, look at averages over several months. Here\nthe news remains positive. Based on the latest revision, firms added an average of\n194,000 jobs per month in 2013, somewhat better than the pace in 2012. This\nconsistent pace of job growth was enough to drop the unemployment rate 1.2\npercentage points last year. In January, it fell a bit further to 6.6 percent. This is\nnoticeably lower than the FOMC anticipated in its Summary of Economic Projections in\nSeptember 2012, when we started the current asset purchase program. That is, the\nlabor market has performed better than expected, according to the unemployment rate\nmeasure.\nShould we be skeptical of the unemployment rate as an indicator of labor market\nconditions? Some people are because the decline in the unemployment rate reflects\nnot only increases in employment but declines in labor force participation as well.\n5\n\n\fDeclines in participation can include discouraged workers who have stopped looking for\nwork because it is difficult to find a job. There is concern in some quarters that the\nunemployment rate will move back up significantly when these discouraged workers\nreenter the labor force. Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned about this\npossibility. 1\nFirst, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates can decline for reasons\nother than a rise in discouraged workers. Indeed, we have seen steadily declining\nparticipation rates since 2000 that reflect demographic changes, most notably the aging\nof the baby boomers. This trend is continuing and has long been expected to\naccelerate.\nSecond, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey’s micro data indicates that\nabout three-quarters of the decline in participation since the start of the recession in\nDecember 2007 can be accounted for by increased retirements and movements into\ndisability. Some of these increases might have been driven by the state of the economy.\nFor example, some baby boomers may have moved their retirement decision forward\nafter losing a job. Nevertheless, few of these individuals are likely to reenter the labor\nforce. So, while I do expect some discouraged workers to reenter the labor force as the\neconomy improves, I still believe the overall unemployment rate remains a good\nsummary statistic of labor market conditions.\nThe business sector is also entering the year on a positive note. At the national level,\nmanufacturing activity accelerated over the final three months of 2013. The\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing, which is a\nreliable indicator of national manufacturing trends, also showed that manufacturing\nactivity picked up in the second half of 2013. In January, the survey’s general activity\nindex posted its eighth consecutive positive number. Expectations for manufacturing\n1\n\nShigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nReport, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, February 6, 2014.\n\n6\n\n\factivity six months ahead also remained positive. This gives me some hope that\nbusiness fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of the\nrecovery, will pick up somewhat this year. Indeed, we saw a nice rebound in equipment\nspending in the fourth quarter.\nInflation has been running below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year.\nIt is important to defend our 2 percent inflation target from both below and above. But\nI believe inflation is likely to move up. Economic growth is firming, and some of the\nfactors that have held inflation down, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare\nproviders, are likely to abate over time.\nAn additional and important determinant of actual inflation is consumer and business\nexpectations of inflation. I am encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their\nlonger-term averages and consistent with our 2 percent target. Thus, I anticipate, as the\nFOMC indicated in its most recent statement, that inflation will move back toward our\ntarget over time. Indeed, given the large amount of monetary accommodation we have\nadded and continue to add to the economy, I think there is some upside risk to inflation\nin the longer term.\nAlthough growth in the first quarter is likely to be somewhat slower than the rapid pace\nwe saw in the second half of last year, overall, I anticipate economic growth of around 3\npercent this year, a pace that is slightly above trend. Everyone would like to see robust\ngrowth of 5 to 6 percent, but I don’t see that happening. Nevertheless, I do see steady\nprogress and an improving economy. This growth is sufficient to result in a continued\ndecline in the unemployment rate, which should reach about 6.2 percent by the end of\n2014.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. The current volatility in emerging market\ncurrencies could pose a risk if it were to spill over more broadly into other financial\n7\n\n\fmarkets. But at this point, I do not consider it a significant risk to the U.S. economy.\nWhile there continues to be some downside risks, for the first time in a few years, I see\na potential for some upside risks to the economic outlook. We need to consider this\npossibility as we calibrate monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nThe Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary policy actions to support the economic\nrecovery. The Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially\nzero, where it has been for more than five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any\nlower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale\nasset purchases. We are now in our third round of this quantitative easing, or, as it is\ncommonly called, QE3. These purchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened\nthe maturity of the assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In this dimension,\nthe FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well past the\ntime that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent threshold. The FOMC had\npreviously indicated this was the earliest point at which it would consider raising\ninterest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s\n2 percent target. On asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the\npurchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the\ncontext of price stability.\nYet, with the economy having improved substantially over the last year and the outlook\nbrightening, the time has come for the FOMC to slow the pace at which it is adding\nmonetary accommodation, which is to say, ease our foot off the accelerator. 2 My\n2\n\nFor more on the subject, see Charles I. Plosser, “The Outlook and the Hazards of Accelerationist Policy,”\nremarks before The University of Delaware Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship,\nNewark, DE, February 14, 2012.\n\n8\n\n\fpersonal view is that the process should have started sooner and proceeded more\nexpeditiously. Nevertheless, the FOMC did decide in December to take a very modest\nstep by reducing asset purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per month, and then\nreduced this by another $10 billion to $65 billion a month in January.\nThe FOMC indicated that if incoming information broadly supports the expectation of\nongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its\nlonger-run objective, then we’ll likely reduce the pace of purchases further in measured\nsteps at future meetings. Former Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in his December\npress conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and continued job\ngains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014.\nNotice that even though we are reducing the pace at which we are purchasing longerterm assets, we are still adding monetary policy accommodation. So, the foot is still on\nthe accelerator. My preference would be that we conclude the purchases sooner rather\nthan later.\nI believe a good case can be made for speeding up the pace of our taper if the economic\noutlook plays out as I expect. As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate fell 1.2\npercentage points last year, and again in January to 6.6 percent. This is a much sharper\ndecline than anticipated when we started the purchase program in September 2012.\nWe are now only one-tenth of a point from the 6.5 percent threshold in our forward\nguidance for interest rates.\nThe FOMC has indicated that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the economy\ncrosses that threshold. However, I do believe that we have a communications\nchallenge. We have not described how policy will be conducted after the\nunemployment rate passes 6.5 percent. Last summer, it was thought that we would\nstop asset purchases by the time unemployment reached 7 percent. Well, that didn’t\nhappen. What is the argument for continuing to increase monetary policy\naccommodation when labor market conditions are improving more quickly than\n9\n\n\fanticipated and inflation has stabilized and is projected to move back to goal? The\nlonger we continue purchases in such an environment, the more likely we will fall\nbehind the curve in reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary policy\naccommodation. With the economy awash in reserves, the costs of such a misfire could\nbe considerably higher than usual, fomenting higher inflation and perhaps financial\ninstability.\nMy preference was, and remains, to scale back our purchase program at a faster pace to\nreflect the strengthening economy. Given the falling unemployment rate, our\ncommunications should be focused on how economic conditions will determine the\ninterest rate path. Continuing to buy assets is neither helpful nor essential.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets\nwill continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its decline,\nreaching 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the\nnext year.\nOn monetary policy, we must back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases to $65 billion a month is moving in the right direction, but that\nmay prove to be insufficient if the economy continues to play out according to the\nFOMC forecasts. I believe the economy has met the criteria for ending the asset\npurchases as there has been significant improvement in labor market conditions. I also\nbelieve that further increases in the balance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable\nbenefits for the recovery and may have unintended consequences. A case can be made\nfor ending the current asset purchase program sooner to reflect the improvement in the\neconomic outlook and to lessen some of the communications problems we will face\n10\n\n\fwith our forward guidance.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and to normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains\nclose to our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the\nseeds of another financial crisis. This means the Fed still has considerable work to do.\n\n11\n\n\f"

That\nis quite a long time. While I am a lot older than when I first started giving these talks, I\ndo not feel particularly wiser. So I guess I have to keep trying until I get it right.\nYou may wonder why, after more than seven years at the Philadelphia Fed, I still look\nforward to returning to Rochester each winter. Well, it is certainly not the weather!\nAlthough, I’ll note that you certainly handle the snow better than we do in Philadelphia.\n1\n\n\fNo, it’s about friends and colleagues, and a community that remains vibrant and\npositive. So, even in the wake of the “Polar Vortex of 2014,” I am delighted to be here\nand to see old friends and familiar faces. Thank you for having me back and for such a\nwarm welcome.\nI have acquired a great deal of respect for weather forecasters over the years, especially\nin turbulent seasons, because as I have noted on many occasions, forecasting even in\ngood times can be a humbling experience. Nonetheless, I am once again going to offer\nyou a forecast for the economy as well as my views on monetary policy. I should note,\nthough, that my views are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal\nReserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nLet me begin by noting that this is a special time for the Federal Reserve. We are\nobserving our 100th anniversary. The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law by\nPresident Woodrow Wilson on December 23, 1913, and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks\nopened their doors on November 16, 1914.\nTo balance political, economic, and geographic interests, Congress created the Federal\nReserve System made up of these 12 regional Reserve Banks with oversight provided by\na Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. This decentralized central bank was\nstructured to overcome political and public concerns that its actions would be\ndominated either by political interests in Washington or by financial interests on Wall\nStreet.\nThe 12 Reserve Banks perform several roles. They distribute currency, act as a bankers’\nbank, and generally perform the functions of a central bank, which includes serving as\nthe bank for the U.S. Treasury. They also play a critical role in supervising many banks\nand bank holding companies.\nMoreover, the Reserve Banks ensure that the Federal Reserve stays in touch with Main\nStreet. The Reserve Banks have boards of directors, many also have Branch boards, and\nall have advisory councils that provide economic insight and information. These\n2\n\n\fcontacts allow the Reserve Banks to keep up to date and knowledgeable about\neconomic conditions in their regions. The Reserve Banks also collect data, run surveys\nof economic activity, and provide economic analyses. This rich array of information and\nthe diverse views from around the country help paint a mosaic of the economy that is\nessential as we formulate national monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the\nsystem with a number of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the\nFOMC has included the seven Governors in Washington, the president of the New York\nFed, and the presidents of four other Reserve Banks who serve one-year terms as\nmembers on a rotating basis.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings a year\nto set monetary policy, and our first one in 2014 was held last week. In normal times,\nthe Committee votes to adjust short-term interest rates to achieve the goals of\nmonetary policy that Congress has set for us in the Federal Reserve Act.\nCongress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\ninterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in\nthe long run.\n\n3\n\n\fEconomic Conditions\nIn order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the\nFOMC must monitor and assess economic developments. So, let me turn to an\nassessment of our economy.\nAs a reminder, last year at this time, I anticipated that we would see real economic\ngrowth of about 3 percent in 2013, that the unemployment rate would reach 7 percent\nin the fourth quarter, and that inflation would gradually rise toward the Fed’s target of 2\npercent. That turned out to be a “not too shabby” forecast. Real growth for the year is\ncurrently estimated at about 2.8 percent, and the unemployment rate was 7 percent for\nthe fourth quarter. Inflation has not risen as much as I thought it would, but it has\nstabilized nonetheless.\nSo let’s look at some of the details of how the year ended and the implications for the\ncoming year. The message is that the economy is on firmer footing than it has been for\nthe past several years.\nReal output grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter of last year,\nfollowing a 4.1 percent growth rate in the third quarter. That means economic growth\nin the second half of 2013 was double that of the first half. Consumer spending and\nbusiness investment in equipment ended the year with strong increases. Inventory\ninvestment and net exports also contributed to growth, while a decline in residential\ninvestment and a sharp decrease in federal government spending subtracted from\ngrowth in the fourth quarter of the year. I expect that there will be less fiscal drag in\n2014 and that housing will continue its recovery.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an\nannual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the highest personal consumption\ngrowth rate since fourth quarter 2010. Rising house prices and stock prices have helped\nimprove consumer balance sheets, and steady job growth has added to wage and salary\ngrowth, all of which have supported spending. The recent December employment\n4\n\n\freport showed payroll gains of 74,000 jobs, which came in below many analysts’\nexpectations. Yet, December’s number was likely affected by the unseasonably cold and\nsnowy weather, although it is not yet clear by how much. The number is also subject to\nrevision, and such revisions can be significant.\nBecause of the month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too\nmuch into the most recent number but, instead, look at averages over several months,\nand here the news remains positive. Firms added an average of 182,000 jobs per month\nlast year, comparable to the pace in 2012. This consistent pace of job growth was\nenough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in December. This means that\nthe unemployment rate fell 1.2 percentage points last year. It also ended the year at a\nlower level than the FOMC anticipated in its Summary of Economic Projections in\nSeptember 2012, when we started the current asset purchase program. That is, the\nlabor market has performed noticeably better than expected, according to the\nunemployment rate measure.\nShould we be skeptical of the unemployment rate as an indicator of labor market\nconditions? Some people are because the decline in the unemployment rate reflects\ndeclines in labor force participation as well as increases in employment. There is even\nconcern that the unemployment rate will move back up significantly when discouraged\nworkers reenter the labor force. Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned\nabout this possibility. 1\nFirst, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates have been declining\nsince 2000. The declines are driven primarily by demographic changes, most notably\nthe aging of the baby boomers. This trend is ongoing and was expected to accelerate.\nSecond, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey’s micro data indicates that\n1\n\nShigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nReport, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, November 19, 2013.\n\n5\n\n\fmuch of the decline in participation since the start of the recovery can be accounted for\nby increased retirements and disability. Some of these increases might have been\ndriven by the state of the economy as some baby boomers may have moved their\nretirement decision forward after losing a job. Nevertheless, few of these individuals\nare likely to reenter the labor force. In addition, there has been an increase in the\nnumber of people out of the workforce who are going to school, which means there is\nless concern about skill depreciation for this group. So, I do expect some discouraged\nworkers to reenter the labor force as the expansion picks up, and while they search for a\njob, there could be upward pressure on the unemployment rate. Nonetheless, I believe\nthe overall unemployment rate remains the best summary statistic of labor market\nconditions.\nThe business sector is also entering the year on a positive note. At the national level,\nmanufacturing activity accelerated over the final three months of 2013. The\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing, which is a\nreliable indicator of national manufacturing trends, also showed that manufacturing\nactivity picked up in the second half of 2013. In January, the survey’s general activity\nindex posted its eighth consecutive positive number. Expectations for manufacturing\nactivity six months ahead also remained positive. This gives me some hope that\nbusiness fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of the\nrecovery, will pick up somewhat this year. Indeed, we saw a nice rebound in equipment\nspending in the fourth quarter.\nInflation has been running below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The Fed’s\npreferred measure of inflation is the year-over-year change in the price index for\npersonal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation. It came in at 1.1 percent last year.\nIt is important to defend our 2 percent inflation target from both below and above. But\nI believe inflation is likely to firm up. Economic growth is accelerating, and some of the\nfactors that have held inflation down, such as the one-time cut in payments to Medicare\nproviders, are likely to abate over time. An additional and important determinant of\n6\n\n\factual inflation is consumer and business expectations of inflation. I am encouraged\nthat inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and consistent with\nour 2 percent target. Thus, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most recent\nstatement, that inflation will move back toward our target over time. Indeed, given the\nlarge amount of monetary accommodation we have added and continue to add to the\neconomy, I think there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nAlthough growth in the first quarter is likely to be somewhat slower than the rapid pace\nwe saw in the fourth quarter of last year, overall, I anticipate economic growth of\naround 3 percent this year, a pace that is slightly above trend. This is far from the\nrobust growth that many would like to see; nevertheless, it does represent steady\nprogress and an improving economy. My forecast is largely in line with those of my\ncolleagues on the FOMC, whose most recent projections saw growth in the 2.8 to 3.2\npercent range in 2014.\nGrowth will continue to lead to declines in the unemployment rate over the next year to\nabout 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. Like my forecast last year, this makes me\nsomewhat more optimistic than most of my FOMC colleagues, who reported a central\ntendency of 6.3 to 6.6 percent by the end of 2014.\nOf course, with any forecast, there are risks. The current volatility in emerging market\ncurrencies could pose a risk if it were to spill over more broadly to other financial\nmarkets. But at this point, I do not consider it a significant risk to the U.S. economy.\nWhile there continues to be some downside risks, for the first time in a few years, I see\na potential for some upside risks to the economic outlook. We need to consider this\npossibility as we calibrate monetary policy.\nMonetary Policy\nOver the past five years, the Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary policy actions to\nsupport the economic recovery. The Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds\nrate — to essentially zero, where it has been for more than five years. Since the policy\n7\n\n\frate cannot go any lower, the Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation\nthrough large-scale asset purchases, or quantitative easing. We are now in our third\nround of these purchases, or, as it is commonly called, QE3. These purchases have\ngreatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of the assets on the Fed’s\nbalance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In this dimension,\nthe FOMC has indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well past the\ntime that the unemployment rate falls below the 6.5 percent threshold. The FOMC had\npreviously indicated this was the earliest point at which it would consider raising\ninterest rates, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2\npercent target. On asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the\npurchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the\ncontext of price stability.\nYet, with the economy having improved substantially over the last year and the outlook\nbrightening, the time has come for the FOMC to slow the pace at which it is adding\nmonetary accommodation, which is to say, ease our foot off the accelerator. My\npersonal view is that the process should have started sooner and proceeded more\nexpeditiously. Nevertheless, the FOMC did decide in December to take a very modest\nstep in this direction by reducing asset purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion per\nmonth, and last week’s decision reduced this by another $10 billion to $65 billion a\nmonth.\nThe FOMC indicated that if incoming information broadly supports its expectation of\nongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its\nlonger-run objective, then we’ll likely reduce the pace of purchases in further measured\nsteps at future meetings. Former Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in his December\npress conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and continued job\ngains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014.\n8\n\n\fNotice that even though we are reducing the pace at which we are purchasing longerterm assets, we are still adding monetary policy accommodation. As I noted earlier, I\nbelieve the economy has already met the criteria of substantial improvement in labor\nmarket conditions, and the economic outlook has improved as well. So my preference\nwould be that we conclude the purchases sooner rather than later.\nIndeed, before the decision to taper in December, I had proposed that we set a total\namount of additional securities we planned to buy and then stop the asset purchases\nonce that amount was reached. In my view, this would have reduced policy uncertainty,\nthereby benefiting the economy. 2 In December, the FOMC announced a reduction in\nthe purchase pace, indicating that purchases were not on a preset course. The\nCommittee continued on this path in January, and while this wasn’t my preferred path, I\nsupported the action as a step in the right direction. I reasoned that by following\nthrough with another measured step to reduce purchases, the Committee was\nstrengthening the signal that the process would continue and thus it was reducing policy\nuncertainty. While I may have preferred a more aggressive scale-back, I was pleased\nthat the FOMC has taken the first two steps on the path toward ending the program.\nThat said, I believe a good case can be made for speeding up the pace of our taper if the\neconomic outlook plays out as I expect. As I noted earlier, the unemployment rate fell\n1.2 percentage points last year, to 6.7 percent in December. This was a much sharper\ndecline than anticipated when we started the purchase program in September 2012. In\nfact, back then, the central tendency of the Committee’s economic projections for\nunemployment in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 7.6 to 7.9 percent compared to the 7\npercent fourth-quarter average that the economy actually achieved. If the\nunemployment rate continues to drop at that pace, we will soon be at the 6.5 percent\nthreshold in our forward guidance for interest rates.\n\n2\n\nCharles I. Plosser, “Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy,” remarks before the Risk Management\nAssociation, Philadelphia, PA, November 18, 2013.\n\n9\n\n\fAlthough the FOMC has indicated that it doesn’t anticipate raising rates when the\neconomy crosses that threshold, I do believe that we will have complicated our\ncommunications if we are still purchasing assets at that point. What is the argument for\ncontinuing to increase monetary policy accommodation when labor market conditions\nare improving rapidly, inflation has stabilized, and the outlook is for it to move back to\ngoal? The longer we continue purchases in such an environment, the more likely we will\nfall behind the curve in reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary policy\naccommodation. With the economy awash in reserves, the costs of such a misfire could\nbe considerably higher than usual, fomenting higher inflation and perhaps financial\ninstability.\nMy preference is to scale back our purchase program at a faster pace to reflect the\nstrengthening economy. I would like to see purchases concluded before the\nunemployment rate reaches the threshold, which is likely during the first half of the\nyear.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets\nwill continue to improve, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its decline,\nreaching 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the\nnext year.\nOn monetary policy, we must begin to back away from increasing the degree of policy\naccommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy. Reducing the\npace of asset purchases to $65 billion a month is moving in the right direction, but that\nmay prove to be insufficient if the economy continues to play out according to the\nFOMC forecasts. I believe the economy has met the criteria of significant improvement\nin labor market conditions for ending the program and that further increases in the\n10\n\n\fbalance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable benefits for the recovery. A case can\nbe made for ending the current asset purchase program sooner to reflect the\nimprovement in the economic outlook and to lessen some of the communications\nproblems we will face with our forward guidance.\nEven after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary policy will still be highly\naccommodative. As the expansion gains traction, the challenge will be to reduce\naccommodation and normalize policy in a way that ensures that inflation remains close\nto our target, that the economy continues to grow, and that we avoid sowing the seeds\nof another financial crisis. This means the Fed still has considerable work ahead.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fPerspectives on the Economy and Monetary Policy\nThe 13th Annual Economic Outlook\nThe School of Business at La Salle University\nUnion League of Philadelphia Business Network\nJanuary 14, 2014\nPhiladelphia, PA\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nHighlights\n• President Charles Plosser provides his economic outlook for 2014 and reports that the\nFOMC’s decision to reduce the pace of asset purchases was a step in the right direction.\n•\n\nBased on the economic progress that has been made and his economic outlook, President\nPlosser believes it is appropriate to end asset purchases and anticipates that purchases will\nend later this year.\n\n• President Plosser expects growth of about 3 percent in 2014. He expects the\nunemployment rate to continue its steady decline and to reach about 6.2 percent by the\nend of 2014. Inflation expectations will be relatively stable, and inflation will move up\ntoward the FOMC target of 2 percent over the next year.\n• President Plosser notes that the Fed still faces considerable challenges as it seeks to\nnormalize policy. He believes that policy should return to a framework in which a market\nrate is our primary policy tool, and accordingly, the size of the balance sheet is reduced and\nrestored to an all-Treasuries portfolio.\n\nIntroduction\nI want to thank La Salle University and the Union League for inviting me to speak at this\nannual economic event. The new year always seems like a good time to reflect on the\npast and refresh our outlook for the future, and I will try to do a bit of both today.\n\n1\n\n\fThis is a particularly noteworthy time in the history of the Federal Reserve. On\nDecember 23, 1913, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the act that created the\nFederal Reserve System. Thus, the Fed’s official 100th anniversary occurred just three\nweeks ago.\nSo, I thought I would begin by sharing a brief history of our nation’s central bank with\nyou before discussing my views on economic conditions and monetary policy.\nBefore I begin, though, I should note that my views are not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee\n(FOMC).\nA Historical Look at a Decentralized Fed\nWhat better place to share a little history of our central bank than here in Philadelphia\nand in this historic venue of the Union League. Just a few blocks from where the\nPhiladelphia Fed stands on Independence Mall, you will find vestiges of two earlier\nattempts to create a central bank for the United States, dating back to the time\nPhiladelphia was the nation’s major financial and political center.\nThe first institution was the brainchild of our first Treasury secretary, Alexander\nHamilton. His efforts led to the creation of the First Bank of the United States, which\nwas awarded a 20-year charter by Congress in 1791.\nAlthough the First Bank’s charter was not renewed, the War of 1812 and the ensuing\ninflation and economic turmoil convinced Congress to establish the Second Bank of the\nUnited States. It was also given a 20-year charter and operated from 1816 to 1836.\nHowever, its charter was not renewed — Congress could not override the veto of\nPresident Andrew Jackson, who led the opposition to the central bank. Public distrust of\ncentralized power was an important factor in the demise of both banks. Both became\nentangled in politics, and both failed to gain the public’s confidence and establish the\n\n2\n\n\findependence necessary to serve our vast and diverse country of bakers and bankers,\nfarmers and financiers, and manufacturers and merchants.\nIt took Congress nearly 80 years to try again to establish a central bank. This time\nCongress and President Wilson agreed upon a uniquely American governance structure\n— a decentralized, central bank.\nTo balance political, economic, and geographic interests, Congress created the Federal\nReserve System made up of regional Reserve Banks with oversight provided by a Board\nof Governors in Washington, D.C.\nThis structure helped to overcome political and public opposition stemming from fears\nthat a central bank would be dominated either by political interests in Washington or by\nfinancial interests on Wall Street.\nThe Federal Reserve Act formed a Reserve Bank Organization Committee to divide the\ncountry into no fewer than eight and no more than 12 Federal Reserve Districts.\nAlmost immediately after the law was enacted, the committee started receiving letters\nand telegrams from local business owners, bankers, farmers, and others, who were all\nmaking a case for where they wanted a Reserve Bank to be located.\nThe committee held meetings in 18 cities before submitting a report to Congress in April\n1914, naming the final 12 cities and districts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nwas designated as the regional Reserve Bank for the Third District, an area that includes\nDelaware, the eastern two-thirds of Pennsylvania, and the southern half of New Jersey.\nThese Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a bankers’ bank, and generally perform\nthe functions of a central bank, which includes serving as the bank for the U.S. Treasury.\nThe 12 regional Reserve Banks are deeply rooted in our nation’s communities, which\nensure that the Federal Reserve stays in touch with Main Street. The Reserve Banks all\nhave boards of directors, many also have Branch boards, and all have advisory councils\n3\n\n\fand other mechanisms to keep abreast of conditions in their regional economies. This\nrich array of information and the diverse views from around the country contribute to a\nmosaic of the economy that is essential as we formulate national monetary policy.\nOf course, most people associate the Fed with the determination of monetary policy.\nWithin the Federal Reserve, the body that makes monetary policy decisions is the\nFederal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC. Here again, Congress has designed the\nsystem with a number of checks and balances. Since 1935, the composition of the\nFOMC has included the seven Governors in Washington, the president of the New York\nFed, and the presidents of four other Reserve Banks who serve one-year terms as\nmembers on a rotating basis.\nOne important role of the independent regional Reserve Banks is to ensure that diverse\nviews are represented. The Reserve Banks each have economic research departments\nto guarantee that a wide variety of perspectives are brought to the table. In this way,\nthe institution avoids groupthink. By being open and transparent about these various\nperspectives, the decentralized model for the Federal Reserve helps strengthen public\nconfidence and preserve its independence.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee’s assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. The FOMC has eight regularly scheduled meetings a year\nto set monetary policy. It discusses economic conditions and, in normal times, adjusts\nshort-term interest rates to achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set\nfor us in the Federal Reserve Act.\nCongress established the current set of monetary policy goals in 1978. The amended\nFederal Reserve Act specifies that the FOMC “shall maintain long run growth of the\nmonetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy’s long run potential\nto increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment,\nstable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” Since moderate long-term\n4\n\n\finterest rates generally result when prices are stable and the economy is operating at\nfull employment, many have interpreted these instructions as being a dual mandate to\nmanage fluctuations in employment in the short run while preserving price stability in\nthe long run.\nEconomic Conditions\nIn order to determine the appropriate monetary policy to promote these goals, the\nFOMC must monitor economic developments. So, let me turn to an assessment of our\neconomy. As we enter 2014, I think the bottom line is that the economy is on firmer\nfooting than it has been for the past several years.\nReal output grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace in the third quarter of last year, the\nstrongest gain in nearly two years and a marked acceleration from the first half of 2013.\nSome of this growth came in the form of inventory investment, which is volatile and is\nless likely to have contributed as much to growth in the fourth quarter. Still, personal\nconsumption and fixed investment provided positive contributions, and economic\nprospects at the end of last year and the beginning of this year are positive.\nPersonal consumption, which accounts more than two-thirds of GDP, advanced at an\nannual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter. Some observers have lamented at the lack\nof stronger growth in consumption. But I would note that consumption growth has not\nfluctuated that much over the course of the recovery. I am encouraged by the U.S.\nconsumers’ persistence in the face of many challenges, including a payroll tax hike last\nJanuary, a government shutdown, significant uncertainties about future tax policy, and\nthe implications of health-care reform.\nConsistent job growth has added to wage and salary growth, which has supported\nspending. The December employment report released last Friday, which showed payroll\ngains of 74,000 jobs, came in below many analysts’ expectations. Yet, I caution you not\nto read too much into one month’s number. December’s number was likely affected by\n\n5\n\n\fthe unseasonably cold and snowy weather, although it is not yet clear by how much.\nThe number is also subject to revision, and such revisions can be significant.\nBecause of the month-to-month volatility and data revisions, I prefer not to read too\nmuch into the most recent number but, instead, look at averages over several months,\nand here the news remains positive. Firms added an average of 182,000 jobs per month\nlast year, comparable to the pace in 2012. This consistent pace of job growth was\nenough to drop the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent in December. This means that\nthe unemployment rate fell 1.2 percentage points last year, and, importantly, it is at a\nlower level than the FOMC anticipated it would be at this point when we started the\ncurrent asset purchase program in September 2012. That is, the labor market has\nperformed noticeably better than expected, according to the unemployment rate\nmeasure.\nSome people, however, feel that the decline in the unemployment rate overstates the\ndegree of progress being made in labor markets because it reflects declines in labor\nforce participation as well as increases in employment. There is even concern that the\nunemployment rate will move back up significantly when discouraged workers reenter\nthe labor force. Based on research by my staff, I am less concerned about this\npossibility. 1\nFirst, it is important to realize that labor force participation rates have been declining\nsince 2000. The declines are driven mostly by demographic changes, including the aging\nof the baby boomers. This trend is ongoing and was expected to accelerate.\nSecond, detailed analysis of the Current Population Survey’s micro data indicates that\nmuch of the decline in participation since the start of the recovery can be accounted for\n1\n\nShigeru Fujita, “On the Causes of Declines in the Labor Force Participation Rate,” Research Rap Special\nReport, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, November 19, 2013.\n\n6\n\n\fby increased retirements and disability. Some of these increases might have been\ndriven by the state of the economy as some baby boomers perhaps moved their\nretirement decision forward after losing a job. Nevertheless, few of these former\nindividuals are likely to reenter the labor force. In addition, there has been an increase\nin the number of people out of the workforce who are going to school, which means\nthere is less concern about skill depreciation for these people. So while I do expect\nsome discouraged workers to reenter the labor force as the expansion picks up and\nwhile they search for a job there could be upward pressure on the unemployment rate, I\nwould not overinterpret the decline in participation as a lack of progress made in labor\nmarket conditions or as a problem that must be corrected. There are fundamental\nchanges in the structure of the labor market that are likely real and sustained.\nThe progress in the labor market has led to growth in household income. In addition to\nincome growth, household balance sheets have strengthened as well. Overall\nhousehold wealth, in nominal terms, advanced 11 percent year over year through the\nthird quarter. The improving housing market has been an important contributor to that\ngrowth, with owners’ equity in real estate surging 29 percent in 2013 over 2012. House\nprices are rising; the number of homeowners with underwater mortgages and the\nnumber of mortgage delinquencies are down. I expect these improvements will help to\nsupport consumer spending going forward.\nBusiness balance sheets are also healthy. Industrial production was very encouraging in\nNovember, when it advanced 1.1 percent on gains in all major categories. That growth\nwas the most rapid in 12 months and brought the overall index higher than its\nprerecession peak for the first time. The Philadelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey of\nregional manufacturing, which is a reliable indicator of national manufacturing trends,\nhas also been in positive territory for seven months, and our firms expect continued\nexpansion in manufacturing activity over the next six months. This gives me some hope\nthat business fixed investment, which has been generally lackluster during the course of\nthe recovery, will pick up somewhat this year.\n7\n\n\fInflation has been running below the FOMC’s long-run goal of 2 percent. The year-overyear change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE inflation,\nis the Fed’s preferred measure. It has drifted downward over the past year to about 0.9\npercent in November. Core PCE, a measure that removes food and energy prices that\ntend to be volatile, was a bit higher at 1.1 percent. I believe we must defend our 2percent inflation target from below and above. However, I believe inflation is likely to\nfirm up as some of the factors that have held it down, such as the cut in payments to\nMedicare providers and generally weak medical costs, are likely to abate over time. I\nam encouraged that inflation expectations remain near their longer-term averages and\nconsistent with our 2-percent target. So, I anticipate, as the FOMC indicated in its most\nrecent statement, that inflation will move back toward our target over time. Indeed,\ngiven the large amount of monetary accommodation we have added and continue to\nadd to the economy, I think that there is some upside risk to inflation in the longer term.\nI anticipate overall economic growth of around 3 percent this year, a pace that is slightly\nabove trend. This is far from the robust growth that many would like to see;\nnevertheless, it does represent steady progress and an improving economy. My\nforecast is largely in line with those of my colleagues on the FOMC, whose most recent\nprojections had a central tendency of growth of 2.2 to 2.3 percent for 2013, and\naccelerating to 2.8 to 3.2 percent in 2014.\nI believe this growth will continue to lead to declines in the unemployment rate over the\nnext year and should result in an unemployment rate of about 6.2 percent by the end of\n2014. This makes me somewhat more optimistic than most of my FOMC colleagues,\nwho reported a central tendency of 6.3 to 6.6 percent by the end of 2014.\nMonetary Policy\nSo, let me turn to some observations about monetary policy. Over the past five years,\nthe Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary actions to support the economic recovery.\nThe Fed has lowered its policy rate — the federal funds rate — to essentially zero,\n8\n\n\fwhere it has been for more than five years. Since the policy rate cannot go any lower,\nthe Fed has attempted to provide additional accommodation through large-scale asset\npurchases, or quantitative easing. We are now in our third round of these purchases, or\nQE3. These purchases have greatly expanded the size and lengthened the maturity of\nthe assets on the Fed’s balance sheet.\nThe Fed is also using forward guidance as a policy tool, which is intended to inform the\npublic about the way monetary policy is likely to evolve in the future. In its December\nstatement, the FOMC indicated that it intends to leave the policy rate near zero well\npast the time that the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, especially if\nprojected inflation continues to run below the FOMC’s 2-percent target.\nOn asset purchases, the FOMC has indicated that it will continue the purchases until the\noutlook for the labor market has improved substantially in the context of price stability.\nThe Fed has structured its latest round of asset purchases as a flow-based program, with\nthe idea that policymakers could fine-tune the rate of purchases in response to the\neconomy.\nThe FOMC decided in December to reduce the purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion\nper month. Thus, we are still adding monetary accommodation but at a slightly slower\npace. Asset purchases are not on a preset course and will continue to be contingent on\nthe FOMC’s economic outlook. However, the FOMC did indicate in December that if\neconomic conditions evolve as expected, with improved labor market conditions and\ninflation moving back toward its goal, then the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset\npurchases in measured steps at future meetings. Chairman Ben Bernanke indicated in\nhis December press conference that if we are making progress in terms of inflation and\ncontinued job gains, then the program would be concluded late in 2014. The December\nemployment report has not changed my belief that the economy has already met the\ncriteria of substantial improvement in labor market conditions. So my preference would\nbe that we conclude the purchases sooner than this, but I am glad that we have taken\nthe first step on the path to ending the program.\n9\n\n\fEventually, monetary policy will be normalized, but the way in which that is done will\ndepend on what operating framework we plan to use in the normalized environment. I\nbelieve that the exit strategy principles laid out by the FOMC in June 2011 still apply.\nMore specifically, we need to return to an operating framework in which a market\ninterest rate is our policy instrument. We also should shrink the size of our balance\nsheet, which is now about $4 trillion, and return to an all-Treasuries portfolio as part of\nthe normalization process.\nThis sounds easy in principle, but I believe the size and composition of our balance sheet\nwill make it challenging to execute smoothly.\nThere are now more than $2.4 trillion of excess reserves in the banking system. These\nreserves are not inflationary until they are converted to money and flow out into the\neconomy.\nBut as market rates rise in an improving economy, banks will find it advantageous to\nbegin to increase lending or acquire assets using their reserves. The challenge for the\nFed is to control the flow of reserves so that we can successfully maintain our 2-percent\ninflation target. This may require raising interest rates more quickly than currently\nanticipated. We have the tools that would enable us to raise rates if we chose to do so.\nHowever, the Fed may be subject to political pressures or pushback from various\ninterest-sensitive sectors that could result in a more measured response than required.\nOne of the consequences would be higher inflation. History suggests that the Fed tends\nto be behind the curve when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, and in the\ncurrent environment, that delay could prove to be more costly than when reserves are\nin limited supply. Thus, it’s a matter of our will rather than our ability.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that the economy is continuing to improve at a moderate pace.\nWe are likely to see growth of around 3 percent in 2014. Prospects for labor markets\n10\n\n\fwill continue to improve gradually, and I expect the unemployment rate will continue its\ndecline to 6.2 percent by the end of 2014. I also believe that inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and that inflation will move up toward our goal of 2 percent over the\nnext year.\nOn monetary policy, the reduction in asset purchases from $85 billion a month to $75\nbillion a month is a step in the right direction. I believe the economy has met the\ncriteria of significant improvement in labor market conditions for ending the program\nand that further increases in the balance sheet are unlikely to provide appreciable\nbenefits for recovery. Even after the asset purchase program has ended, monetary\npolicy will still be highly accommodative.\nThe work of the Fed, however, is far from over. Monetary policy still faces considerable\nchallenges as we seek to normalize policy. The task should be to return to a framework\nin which a market rate is our primary policy tool, to reduce the size of our balance sheet,\nand to restore our portfolio to all Treasuries. The challenge will be to do so in a way\nthat ensures that inflation remains close to our target, that the economy continues to\ngrow, and that we avoid sowing the seeds of another financial crisis.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fShocks, Gaps, and Monetary Policy\nKAEA-Maekyung Forum\nKorea-America Economic Association\nPhiladelphia, PA\nJanuary 4, 2014\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nHighlights:\n• President Charles Plosser notes there are several different ways to interpret the economic dynamics\nduring the recent recession and recovery. Some view the shocks hitting the economy as transitory\nand potential GDP as stable. Others view the shocks as being more permanent, affecting both\nactual and potential output. Those perspectives would call for different policy responses.\n• President Plosser says this is one of the reasons why monetary policymakers should think in terms of\npolicies that are likely to be robust across many models and perspectives.\n• He advocates that systematic policymaking seems to be the most promising approach, because it\ntends to be more transparent and minimizes the degree to which data mismeasurement and model\nuncertainty affect policy.\n\nI want to thank Bang Jeon, president of the Korea-America Economic Association (KAEA), who is\non the faculty here at Drexel University, and Yongsung Chang, vice president of the KAEA, who\nis on the faculty at the University of Rochester, for inviting me to speak to this forum. The KAEA\nhas hosted a number of prominent speakers in recent years at its annual meetings, and so it is a\npleasure and an honor to speak to you this evening.\nMuch has happened in the field of macroeconomics and monetary policy in the past seven\nyears since I left Rochester to join the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Today I want to\nhighlight some key features of the recent recession and the recovery and to discuss how they\nhave influenced my views on monetary policymaking. Before I begin, though, I would like to\npoint out that my views are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my\ncolleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\n1\n\n\fThe challenges presented by the recession and recovery have illustrated why policymakers\nmust have a framework that provides a basis for their policy judgments. We say that our\npolicymaking is data dependent, but without a lens through which we view economic data, it is\nimpossible to interpret those data in any sort of useful way, particularly as they pertain to\npolicy. However, policymakers also must approach their task with a great deal of humility. The\nlens through which we look is often foggy and lacking focus. There is still much we do not\nunderstand about recent events, and I am mindful that further research is likely to bring more\nclarity to the narrative and to our ability to make more informed policy decisions going forward.\nAfter all, economists are still debating the events surrounding the Great Depression threequarters of a century after it ended. Indeed, I would argue that none of us have the economic\ntheory exactly right. That is why I believe it is useful and important that policy discussions\ninclude a healthy debate with different perspectives clearly represented. There are many\ndifferent interpretations of recent events, each with strengths and weakness and it is unlikely\nthat economists will converge to a common or shared understanding of these events anytime\nsoon. Unfortunately, this is not just a characteristic of the current economic environment – it is\nthe typical state of affairs – and it is one of the reasons I believe it is important for monetary\npolicymakers to think in terms of policies that are likely to be robust across many models and\nperspectives.\nThe Traditional View of Shocks and Gaps\nI want to organize my comments today around “shocks” and “gaps.” I find this to be a simple\nbut useful way to highlight some different perspectives and their implications. For example,\neconomists have different views about the nature of the shocks that sent the economy into\nrecession and about the dynamics of the economy in response to those shocks. Those\ndynamics are summarized by the economic models or frameworks economists use to interpret\nincoming data. As a policymaker, I think it is impossible to determine the right course of policy\nwithout an assessment of the nature of the shocks and a framework or implicit model for the\neconomy.\n\n2\n\n\fOne way to characterize some of the key differences in models is to view how the models\nassess departures from some concept of ideal or desirable outcomes. The concept could be a\nsteady state, some notion of economic potential, or the economic efficient outcome.\nDepartures of the economy from these ideal outcomes can be viewed as gaps. Of course, to\nthe extent that the ideal outcomes are model dependent, the gaps would also depend on the\nmodel one is using.\nAccording to one perspective, which I’ll call the traditional view, shocks hitting the economy are\nlargely transitory and dissipate rather quickly over time. Negative shocks can then give rise to\nsomething called a negative output gap – a level of output that is lower than the level\nconsistent with the economy operating at its full potential. Such a gap then becomes an object\nthat policy seeks to close or eliminate. In some models, this negative output gap also acts to\ndampen inflation.\nThink about the recent recession. Some economists and policymakers characterize the shock\nthat hit financial markets as a temporary, albeit large, aggregate demand shock. This shock gave\nrise to a large “output gap,” sometimes referred to as slack, which, in turn, is working to keep\ninflation low. According to this view, the large output gap and low inflation justify keeping\ninterest rates near zero for a long time. The belief is that low rates will help to close the output\ngap by increasing the growth of demand and thus output, which will reduce slack and allow\ninflation to move back to target. In this perspective, there are headwinds that are temporarily\nrestraining economic growth, but these can be offset with aggressive monetary\naccommodation.\nAn Alternative View of Shocks and Gaps\nBut there is an alternative interpretation. Let’s look at a rather simple, but I think useful,\nfigure. 1 The figure shows the level of real GDP as well as various vintages of potential GDP\nestimated by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO defines potential GDP as a\n\n1\n\nSee figure below.\n\n3\n\n\f“measure of the economy’s maximum sustainable output, in which the intensity of resource\nuse is neither adding to nor subtracting from inflationary pressure.” 2 Such a definition\nobviously has embedded in it some implicit assumptions about an underlying economic model,\nbut I will return to this point shortly.\nI would like to draw your attention to two noteworthy features. First, during the recession,\nGDP fell sharply, as we all know. But since the end of the recession in June 2009, the economy\nhas continued to grow at roughly the same pace as it grew before the recession. There has\nbeen little evidence of the rapid growth required to return the economy to the path of\npotential GDP as estimated by the CBO in 2007. While that may still happen, there has not\nbeen the V-shaped recovery to date anticipated by many. The shock that hit the economy\nappears to have had very persistent, if not permanent, effects. From a statistical perspective,\nthe economy appears to have taken a permanent hit to the output level.\nThe second noteworthy feature illustrated in the figure is that the CBO has revised its estimate\nof the path of potential GDP numerous times since the beginning of the recession. Specifically,\nalmost every year since 2007, it has revised down potential GDP. I am showing only three\nvintages here as an example. If you look at the “gap,” or the difference between the actual\nlevel of GDP – measured as of February 2013 when the latest CBO estimate of potential was\nreleased – and estimated potential, it is about half the size that it would have been if the path\nof potential GDP had not been revised. The gap is closing not because GDP has rebounded\ntoward the earlier estimates of potential – but because potential GDP has fallen. And this has\noccurred in spite of aggressive policies – especially monetary policy – that were intended to\nboost economic growth rates.\nSo, what might one infer from these observations? I want to offer a perspective based on some\nempirical research that Charles Nelson and I published in the Journal of Monetary Economics\n\nCongressional Budget Office, “A Summary of Alternative Methods for Estimating Potential GDP,” Background\nPaper, March 2004, p. 1.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\fover three decades ago. 3 In that paper, we concluded that real output contained important\nstochastic trends. A stochastic trend is often characterized as a random walk. A particular\nfeature of a random walk is that it doesn’t exhibit any mean reversion. It means that the\nstochastic shocks that drive such a series accumulate. Put another way, each shock is\npermanently embodied in the level of the series – there is little tendency to return to a previous\ntrend line. Such shocks are the antithesis of transitory, or what some refer to as cyclical, shocks\nthat, by definition, dissipate over time.\nIn our analysis, Nelson and I assumed that the economy was buffeted by a mixture of\npermanent and transitory shocks. Such a framework is not unusual and is compatible with the\ntype of permanent and transitory distinction stressed in Milton Friedman’s permanent income\nhypothesis. 4 More generally, in dynamic models, forward-looking agents’ responses to\npermanent shocks can be quite different from their responses to transitory shocks. For\nexample, in the permanent income framework, agents adjust consumption much more in\nresponse to changes in permanent income than to temporary changes in income. Our\nstatistical analysis found that a large portion of the fluctuations in real GDP were the result of\nshocks to the stochastic trend, that is, permanent shocks. Interestingly, the recent recession\nsaw a marked drop in consumption. Some of this decline may have been due to credit\nconstraints that became binding on some consumers. But some of the decline likely reflected\nthe fact that many consumers now perceived that their permanent income had fallen, so they\nreduced their level of consumption.\nLooking at the figure, we see that the behavior of the GDP suggests that in the recent recession,\nthe U.S. economy sustained what appears to be a permanent or at least highly persistent shock\nto the supply side of the economy that has lowered the level of GDP – although not necessarily\nits growth rate. One could contemplate numerous hypotheses about the nature of such a\nshock. In 2009, I put forward the idea that the crisis and recession were caused by a shock that\n3\n\nCharles R. Nelson and Charles I. Plosser, “Trends and Random Walks in Macroeconomic Time Series: Some\nEvidence and Implications,” Journal of Monetary Economics, 10 (1982), pp. 139–162.\n\n4\n\nMilton Friedman, A Theory of the Consumption Function, Princeton: Princeton University Press (1957).\n\n5\n\n\flikely had either permanent or very long-lasting consequences for the economy. I suggested\nthat the financial crisis may have precipitated a permanent or highly persistent decline in the\noutput of financial intermediation. I have also considered the possibility that the collapse in\nhouse values could be viewed as a permanent loss of wealth affecting household balance\nsheets. Either of these disturbances would require significant real adjustments in the\neconomy. 5\nIf we view the shock we experienced as largely permanent in nature, in contrast to being largely\ntransitory, then it alters the way we should think about gaps and about the policy responses,\nparticularly appropriate monetary policy. If you accept the idea that money is neutral in the\nlong run, then efforts to use monetary policy to offset such permanent shocks and to close\nwhat appears to be a gap will likely be ineffective and perhaps even counterproductive. The\nreal economy must ultimately adjust to such permanent shocks. Monetary policy cannot offset\nthe costs or the necessity of such real adjustments, and so it is unlikely to be an effective\nstabilization tool.\nLooking at the figure again, we see the repeated downward revision in the estimate of potential\nGDP suggests that the CBO is gradually recognizing that the fall in output was most likely a\npermanent or at least highly persistent shock to the supply side of the economy. In other\nwords, the CBO’s measures of potential output now recognize that the shock that hit the\neconomy damaged the productive potential of the economy in a persistent way, as potential\nGDP is now lower as far out as 2020. Therefore, the output gap is no longer what we thought it\nwas – it has been revised down over time. One can wonder whether five years from now the\nCBO’s potential GDP estimates will gradually converge with the existing growth path of real\nGDP. At that point, the output gap will have been gradually revised away.\nThe constant revision of estimates of potential output and thus of the output gap also\nunderscore one of the difficulties policymakers have in trying to use gaps as a guide to\n5\n\nCharles Plosser, “A Perspective on the Outlook, Output Gaps, and Price Stability,” speech presented to Money\nMarketeers, New York, May 21, 2009.\n\n6\n\n\fpolicymaking in real time. Indeed, Athanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden have argued\nthat a major problem that gave rise to the great inflation of the 1970s was the\nmismeasurement of the perceived output gap. 6 They explained how the Fed consistently relied\non estimated output gaps that were subsequently revised and ended up being much smaller\nthan initially thought. They argue that policymakers’ reliance on estimated gaps led to overly\nexpansionary monetary policy and the resulting high rates of inflation.\nThere is a separate and perhaps more challenging issue. While a permanent shock to the level\nof GDP is disturbing enough, it would be even worse if the underlying growth rate of the\neconomy were to slow. Economists normally think that the longer-run growth rate of the\neconomy is roughly the sum of the growth rate of the labor force and the growth rate of\nproductivity. Here again, monetary policy would not be an effective tool to address such real\neconomic challenges as slower labor force or productivity growth. Appropriate policies would\nrequire focusing on increasing productivity and the quality of the labor force, not on traditional\ncountercyclical monetary policy.\nAlternative Concepts for the Gap\nTo this point, I’ve talked about the traditional view and an alternative view of the nature of the\nshock the economy experienced and how these views change the nature of the gap and the\nappropriate monetary policy response. But as I mentioned at the outset, there are different\nways to approach the standard to which economic performance is measured. In particular, we\nneed to remember that economic theory does not give us a unique way to define gaps.\nDifferent models can offer different conceptual approaches to the gap.\nFor example, as I mentioned earlier, implicit in the CBO’s approach to constructing potential\nGDP is a model of the economy and the concept of a noninflationary maximum level of output.\nOne feature of the CBO’s construct of potential, and many others’, is that potential output\nmoves very slowly and very smoothly. This means that potential GDP does not – indeed,\n6\n\nAthanasios Orphanides and Simon van Norden, “The Reliability of Inflation Based on Output Gap Estimates in\nReal Time,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 37 (2005), pp. 583–601.\n\n7\n\n\fcannot – respond much to current shocks to the economy regardless of their magnitude or\nsource, especially in real time.\nThis is in contrast to research Nelson and I conducted that revealed that a significant proportion\nof the variability in GDP was due to permanent or very long-lasting shocks. While our statistical\napproach was not based on an economic model, there is good reason to believe that shocks\nthat give rise to permanent changes in GDP should be viewed differently from those that give\nrise to purely transitory movements, especially in terms of their policy prescriptions. Measures\nthat arbitrarily, or by assumption, assign the bulk of fluctuation in GDP to purely temporary\nfactors may provide poor policy guidance when shocks are more permanent in nature.\nA different conceptual approach to defining a gap is implied by a class of economic models in\nwide use today – the new Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, models.\nDSGE models explicitly posit that firms have some pricing power; that is, there is imperfect\ncompetition so that a firm can choose to sell more of its output by lowering its price or to sell\nless of its output by raising its price, and the firm will set its price at a markup over marginal\ncost to maximize its profits. DSGE models also assume that firms are able to only adjust prices\ninfrequently. This form of sticky prices, together with imperfect competition, allow monetary\npolicy to have real effects in the short run, while remaining neutral for the real side of the\neconomy in the long run. The sticky prices generate distortions that mean allocations and\noutput can be inefficient in the face of shocks. In these models, the efficient level of output is\nthe level of output that would prevail in the absence of the sticky prices and other market\nimperfections that allow deviations from perfect competition.\nIn this framework, the relevant output gap to be addressed is the difference between the\nefficient level and that level generated by the distortion introduced by the sticky prices and\nmarket imperfections. The behavior of the efficient level of output is unlikely to be a smooth or\na slowly evolving series like the CBO concept. In fact, it could be quite volatile and may bear\nlittle or no resemblance to the traditional concept of potential used by the CBO and others.\nEfficient output would be altered by changes in technology that affect productivity or changes\nin agents’ preferences. The role of monetary policy in these models is to react to economic\n8\n\n\fconditions in a way that minimizes the potential for distortions arising from the price stickiness\nor other market imperfections. The general policy prescription is to minimize the gap between\noutput and the efficient level of output. In the absence of unexpected events that lead firms to\nchange their desired markups over marginal cost, or other real rigidities like real wage rigidities,\nthis would be equivalent to stabilizing inflation. 7\nA great deal of work is being done on this class of models. For example, many researchers are\nattempting to build richer models that have a more elaborate financial sector in light of the\nrecent financial crisis, and they are incorporating frictions of various kinds. Regardless of how\nthese models are enhanced, their concept of the gap will continue to be a deviation of output\nfrom the efficient level that would prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities and market\nimperfections. Therefore, the gap in these models will remain conceptually different from a\ngap based on potential output. And there is no reason to believe that the policy prescriptions\nbased on these gaps will be the same. Indeed, the nature of the shock will be an important\ndeterminant in whether the efficient output level changes and whether monetary policy should\nreact or not.\nConclusion\nPolicymakers need a framework with which to evaluate incoming data in order to set\nappropriate monetary policy. But the recession and recovery have underscored that we must\nremain humble about our degree of understanding of the economy and that we must entertain\nvarious perspectives in setting policy. As I’ve discussed, there are several different ways to\ninterpret the economic dynamics we have seen in recent years, and those perspectives would\ncall for different policy responses. Some view the shocks hitting the economy as transitory and\npotential GDP as stable. Others view the shocks as being more permanent, affecting both\nactual and potential output.\n\n7\n\nSee Jordi Gali and Olivier Blanchard, “Real Wage Rigidities and the New Keynesian Model,” Journal of Money,\nCredit and Banking, 39 (2007), pp. 35–65 and Aubhik Khan, Robert G.

Each of these perspectives has some merit\nas well as drawbacks, and it will be some time (if ever) when we will know which perspective is\nthe correct one in explaining our recent economic experience.\nThis state of affairs has led me to be skeptical of relying on gaps in general as well as optimal\ncontrol exercises that are derived from specific models. Instead, I have long advocated that we\nshould think in terms of robust policies that yield good economic outcomes across a variety of\nmodels and frameworks. 8 In my view, a robust, systematic approach to policy, which is\ntransparent and minimizes the degree to which data mismeasurement and model uncertainty\naffect policy is the most promising approach to the uncertainties facing policymakers in real\ntime.\n\n8\n\nCharles Plosser, “Output Gaps and Robust Policy Rules,” speech presented to the 2010 European Banking and\nFinancial Forum, Czech National Bank, Prague, the Czech Republic, March 23, 2010.\n\n10\n\n\f11\n\n\f"
