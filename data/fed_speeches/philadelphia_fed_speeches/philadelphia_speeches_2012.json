Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nThe last five years have been an extraordinary time for the global economy and monetary\npolicymakers. The financial crisis and the severe global recession that followed have tested our\nresolve, our patience, and our economic theories. To restore the health of ailing financial\nmarkets and economies, central banks have driven short-term interest rates to essentially zero,\nexpanded their balance sheets to unprecedented levels, and engaged in market interventions\nthat have blurred the lines between monetary policy and fiscal policy.\nThese extraordinary efforts were well intentioned. Although it will be some time before we\nfully understand the effectiveness of various actions, some have credited them with preserving\nfinancial markets and saving the global economy from an even deeper recession. Yet, these\nactions also carry long-term risks for our economies and for central banks.\nIn my remarks today, I will focus on U.S. monetary policy and discuss some of the longer-term\nrisks arising from our policy responses to the financial crisis and slow recovery. I will then share\nmy thoughts on an approach to monetary policy that I believe would prove beneficial in the\npost-crisis economy.\nBefore continuing let me note that my views are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nThe Risks of Extraordinary Accommodation and Nontraditional Policies\nLet me begin by reviewing the extraordinary actions taken by the Federal Reserve as it\nattempted to maintain liquidity and the basic functioning of our financial markets and\nsubsequently to support an economic recovery.\nDuring the height of the crisis, the Federal Reserve instituted various liquidity facilities for\nparticular segments of the financial system that were under stress. These programs supported\nprimary dealers, the commercial paper market, and money market fund investors. The Fed also\n1\n\n\fgave support to specific individual institutions, including Bear Stearns and AIG, to avert what\ncould have been disorderly failures.\nAfter reducing its policy rate, the fed funds rate, to essentially zero, the Fed instituted several\nlarge-scale asset-purchase programs. The first of these programs of quantitative easing,\ncommonly referred to as QE1, ultimately involved purchasing $175 billion of housing agency\ndebt and $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS; the Fed also purchased\n$300 billion in longer-term Treasuries in 2009. The unprecedented purchases of significant\nquantities of MBS were intended to support housing – the specific sector of the economy in\nwhich the financial crisis was centered.\nAs market functioning returned to normal, large-scale asset purchases continued. But the\npurpose shifted to providing monetary stimulus or defending against the potential for deflation\nwhile our policy instrument was constrained by the zero lower bound rather than supporting\nmarket functioning or lender-of-last-resort activities. As the economy struggled to recover and\ndeflation became a concern, the Fed implemented QE2, a program to purchase $600 billion in\nlonger-term Treasury securities. Most recently, the Fed instituted QE3, an open-ended program\nto purchase agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month.\nIn addition to the asset-purchase programs, the Fed has been engaged in a maturity extension\nprogram, popularly referred to as operation twist – an intervention that was last attempted,\nwith little success, in the 1960s. The objective of this program is to flatten the yield curve by\nremoving duration from the market.1 Finally, the Fed has attempted to alter public\nexpectations of the future path of monetary policy and the economy by issuing forward\nguidance about how long it expects to keep the fed funds rate exceptionally low. As of\nSeptember, that expected date was at least through mid-2015.\nAs a result of these policy initiatives, the Fed has now held its policy rate near zero for almost\nfour years, its balance sheet is more than three times larger than before the crisis, and the\ncomposition of its balance sheet has shifted toward mainly longer-term housing-related and\nTreasury securities compared with mostly short-term Treasury securities held before the crisis.\nIndeed, by the end of this year, the Fed will hold almost no short-term Treasuries.\nDespite these extraordinary efforts by the Fed, our economy remains lackluster –\nunemployment remains uncomfortably high and is declining only slowly, economic growth is\nmediocre, and confidence in the future remains subpar.\nLooking at this state of economic affairs, one might conclude that the Fed just hasn’t done\nenough. Since the Fed seems to be missing on the employment part of its dual mandate, some\n1\n\nI note that operation twist could easily have been conducted, or fully offset, by having the Treasury alter the\nmaturity structure of the public debt. Like the purchases of housing-related assets, this action blurs the line\nbetween fiscal and monetary policy.\n\n2\n\n\fsuggest the Fed can and should continue to pursue more accommodation as long as inflation\nremains contained. But this is not the only conclusion one could draw from the evidence.\nInstead, one could conclude that the factors contributing to mediocre economic performance\ncannot be offset by monetary policy.\nThis alternative hypothesis should not come entirely as a surprise or as a radical point of view.\nThe ability of monetary policy to influence employment has long been recognized as tenuous at\nbest. Indeed, the current workhorse models in macroeconomics rely on some form of wage or\nprice stickiness to generate real effects of monetary policy. As wages and prices adjust, the\neffects of monetary policy on the real economy dissipate; in other words, the effects are\ntransitory. In addition, the experience of the 1970s clearly demonstrated that attempts to use\nmonetary policy to pursue an employment or unemployment target can lead to extremely poor\neconomic outcomes, jeopardizing both employment and inflation.\nOf course, one might argue that even if there was only a small chance that additional\naccommodation could put people back to work more quickly, it would be worth undertaking.\nYet, that would only be true if the potential benefits of such a policy outweigh the potential\nrisks that such accommodation creates. I join many economists who are skeptical that further\nasset purchases will have much effect on longer-term interest rates. Even if they do, the\ndeclines in long rates are likely to have fairly negligible effects on employment or growth at\nbest. On the other hand, I believe the extraordinary policies the Fed has pursued pose\nsubstantive longer-term risks: These include moral hazard, future inflation, and loss of\ninstitutional credibility.\nMoral Hazard. Let’s first discuss moral hazard. In taking unconventional and unusual steps in\nrecent years, policymakers run the risk of altering the public’s expectations of how policy will be\nconducted in the future. This is most frequently discussed in the context of the too-big-to-fail\n(TBTF) problem. In trying to stabilize the financial system, policies led creditors of large\nfinancial institutions to expect that the government will protect them from losses. This creates\nmoral hazard and undermines the market discipline that creditors exert on a firm’s risk-taking.\nWithout a clear set of rules or guidelines that tell market participants how such lender-of-lastresort policies will be conducted in the future, the actions run the risk of sowing the seeds of a\nfuture credit crisis. Moreover, it is unlikely that regulatory reform as embodied in Dodd-Frank\nhas substantially addressed the TBTF problem. Indeed, some have argued that it has expanded\nthe government safety net, thereby aggravating moral hazard.\nYet, moral hazard risks are not confined to the TBTF problem. By engaging in targeted\npurchases of housing-related securities, the Fed has affected expectations about what\nmonetary policy will do in the future should the housing market take a sharp downturn. Will\nmarket participants price housing-related assets with the expectation that the Fed will protect\nthe market from significant losses? Will investors in other markets expect similar treatment\nand therefore be encouraged to take excessive risk? Similarly, will holding rates at essentially\nzero for a long time also spur increased and undesirable risk-taking in the search for higher\nyields? Certainly, the Fed does not intend to create such moral hazard. Yet, the lack of clear\n3\n\n\fguidelines about future monetary policy can introduce its own form of instability and\nuncertainty.\nFuture Inflation Risks. Another potential risk is future inflation. So far, the asset-purchase\nprograms have expanded the Fed’s balance-sheet assets from about $900 billion before the\ncrisis to nearly $3 trillion. Banks are holding $1.5 trillion in excess reserves in their accounts at\nthe Fed. These reserves are not inflationary in the current environment. Indeed, inflation and\ninflation expectations remain near our goal, despite high unemployment rates or large\nmeasures of output gaps.\nYet, history tells us that central banks tend to find it easier to lower interest rates than to raise\nthem. Moreover, it is difficult to identify the appropriate moment to begin tightening policy,\neven in the best of times. The tremendous expansion in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet\ncomplicates the challenges the Fed will face when it comes time to begin exiting from this\nperiod of extraordinary accommodation.\nOnce the recovery strengthens — and it surely will — long rates will begin to rise and banks will\nbegin lending out their excess reserves. Loan growth could be quite rapid, and there is a real\npossibility that the Fed will have to withdraw accommodation very aggressively in order to\nrestrain money growth and inflation. While economic conditions might evolve very gradually,\nfinancial markets are not always patient. As soon as the markets perceive that the Fed might\nbegin to remove accommodation, we could see long-term rates move up quite rapidly. In such\nan environment, policymakers might need to tighten policy quickly to contain inflationary\npressures. Will this tightening require rapid sales of housing-related assets that could\npotentially disrupt a recovering housing market? The bigger our balance sheet, the more\ndifficult it will be to exit in a way that meets our inflation objective without creating instability\nin the real economy, thereby undermining our credibility and reputation.\nInstitutional Risk. The Fed’s recent policy choices also impose other institutional risks. The\npurchase of large quantities of housing-related securities is viewed by some commentators and\npolicymakers as a type of credit allocation to one sector of the economy in preference to other\nsectors. I, and others, believe such credit allocations should be in the province of the fiscal\nauthorities, not the central bank. Blurring the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies\ncan pose institutional risks for the central bank and its independence.\nAs I mentioned, the Fed’s balance sheet is not only quite large, but it now contains mostly longterm securities. As interest rates rise, if the Fed finds it must sell assets at a rapid pace to\nrestrain inflation, it would very likely incur substantial losses. If so, the Fed may not be able to\nmake any remittances to the Treasury for some years. While this is of little macroeconomic\nsignificance, it will not go unnoticed, particularly in an era when the government will be\nstruggling to reduce deficits. This could place considerable short-term pressure on the Fed to\nprevent those losses by tightening policy more slowly than might otherwise be appropriate. If,\ninstead of asset sales, the Fed tries to restrain credit growth by increasing the interest rate paid\non excess reserves, this too would reduce our remittances to the Treasury as more of the Fed’s\n4\n\n\fincome would be paid out to the banks holding the reserves. Again, this is of little significance\nto the macroeconomy, but it is a risk to perceptions about the institution, which eventually may\nput the Fed’s independence at risk.\nIt is very hard to quantify the risks associated with our unconventional policies. But they are\nreal. With our recent extraordinary policies, we have sailed into uncharted territory; we need\nto acknowledge that, proceed with caution, and continually assess the potential costs and\nbenefits of our policy actions.\nMonetary Policy Principles\nI would like to spend my remaining time outlining my preferred course for setting policy in\nthese uncharted waters. Even in such an environment, or perhaps even more so in such an\nenvironment, I believe sound and effective central banking should focus on four guiding\nprinciples.\nThe first principle is to be clear and explicit about the goals and objectives of policy. And in so\ndoing, policymakers must acknowledge what policy can and cannot achieve.\nThe second principle is for policymakers to make a credible commitment to their goals by\ndescribing how they will conduct policy in a way that is consistent with those goals. One way to\ndo this is for the central bank to articulate a reaction function or rule that will guide policy\ndecisions.\nThe third principle is to be clear and transparent in communicating to the public the policy\nactions that are taken.\nThe fourth principle is to strive to ensure central bank independence.\nDuring the last few years, the Federal Reserve has made some important strides in advancing\nthese principles. Most important in my view was the statement of the FOMC’s longer-run goals\nand policy strategy released in January. This statement made explicit for the first time the\nFOMC’s goal of a 2 percent inflation target. It also explained why it was inappropriate for the\nFOMC to establish an explicit numerical objective for the employment portion of our mandate.\nIndeed, in this respect, I believe the statement helped to explain certain limitations of what\nmonetary policy can achieve.\nThe Federal Reserve has also made great strides in enhancing transparency. It has expanded\nthe quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, or SEPs, and has begun to include information\non each participant’s view of the appropriate monetary policy that underlies these projections.\nThe Chairman now holds press conferences following each of the meetings at which the SEPs\nare compiled.\n5\n\n\fA Systematic Approach to Monetary Policy\nI believe we could take further steps to improve our communications and reduce uncertainty\nover the path of monetary policy and reduce moral hazard. One enhancement would be to\narticulate a more rule-like approach to our decision-making process. This means making policy\ndecisions based on available information in a consistent and predictable manner. One cannot\nknow what the future holds or what future policy decisions will be. Policy will be data\ndependent, but the data should feed into a decision-making process in a mostly systematic or\nrule-like way.\nResearch has shown that more systematic policy can generate better economic outcomes and\nthat there are simple monetary policy rules that perform well in a variety of models. 2 Of\ncourse, the Taylor rule is the most well known of these simple rules, but a number of variations\nhave been studied, including growth-rate rules and first-difference rules that avoid some of the\nmeasurement issues of rules based on gaps or levels. Because we simply do not know the true\nmodel of the economy, I prefer to focus on a set of robust rules designed to give good results\nacross a variety of models.\nThese robust rules tend to have some features in common. They suggest that policy should\nrespond aggressively to deviations of inflation from target but more modestly to measures of\neconomic slack, such as output gaps or unemployment. These robust rules also tend to exhibit\ninertia that prevents the policy rate from significant swings or volatility.\nI believe that by using these robust rules and being explicit that such rules are important guides\nfor policy, we could make policymaking more transparent and make policy actions more\npredictable. Indeed, articulating rules as guides provides the best kind of forward guidance,\nwhich would be helpful in stabilizing the economy and the path of inflation. In this approach,\nthe FOMC would describe its policy decisions in terms of how the arguments in such rules\nchange. For example, we would indicate that we chose to tighten policy because inflation or\ninflation expectations rose or some measure of resource utilization, such as capacity utilization,\nunemployment, employment growth, or an output gap, improved. Conversely, we would\nexplain that we took actions to increase accommodation because inflation or inflation\nexpectations fell or some measure of resource utilization weakened. There would be an added\nbenefit of accountability from this approach because it would require policymakers to explain\nwhy they might choose to deviate from the guidelines offered by the rules at certain times.\nWith the fed funds rate at the zero lower bound and the Fed engaging in large-scale asset\npurchases, now may be one of those times. For example, some economists argue that because\nthe policy rate has been stuck at the zero lower bound for some time, policy should be set at a\nmore accommodative stance than what would be suggested by the standard set of rules.\n2\n\nMost of the macroeconomic models economists and policymakers rely on to assess the effects of policy actions in\nfact assume that policy is conducted in a well-understood systematic manner.\n\n6\n\n\fAlthough some of the standard rules suggest that the current stance of policy is a bit too tight,\nothers suggest that a policy rate of zero is too low, given economic conditions. While the zero\nlower bound needs to be considered in setting appropriate policy, it does not mean that the\nsystematic approach I advocate should be abandoned or simply ignored. Instead, I would argue\nthat we use the rules as guides and then explain why the zero lower bound might suggest\ndeviating from the prescriptions of those rules when appropriate. This approach will be\nparticularly helpful when all of the rules begin to point to policy tightening.\nI believe the systematic approach I have advocated is also preferable to the calendar-date\nforward guidance that the FOMC is currently providing. I also think that it is preferable to\nproposals to use quantitative thresholds to convey policy guidance.\nThe Committee first used calendar-date forward guidance in its August 2011 statement when it\nindicated that it anticipated that economic conditions would likely warrant keeping the fed\nfunds rate exceptionally low at least through mid-2013. In January 2012, the Committee\nlengthened that horizon to at least late 2014, and in September, it lengthened it again to at\nleast mid-2015. Date-based forward guidance is problematic. Instead, a systematic approach\nprovides data-based forward guidance. Policy decisions should be made and explained in terms\nof economic conditions, not the calendar.\nI also prefer the systematic or rules-based approach I have outlined to proposals calling for the\nCommittee to indicate that it will not contemplate raising the funds rate while unemployment\nis above some threshold, as long as inflation is below some threshold. Some view this as a way\nto move away from calendar-date forward guidance by specifying the economic conditions that\nmight prevail when the Fed begins to reverse course. Once either of the thresholds is met, the\nCommittee will consider whether to take action. That is, meeting a threshold may be a\nnecessary but not sufficient condition for action. In my view, this threshold approach could\ncause some long-lasting confusion, especially if the thresholds are misinterpreted as the\nFOMC’s longer-run policy goals. But how do you decide on the right numerical values?\nMoreover, if numerical thresholds were provided as a way to convey forward guidance for the\nfed funds rate, a numerical stopping rule would also be needed to convey when QE3 asset\npurchases could be expected to end. This means we may have multiple thresholds associated\nwith multiple tools. It would be difficult to describe all the various conditions necessary for this\nmulti-faceted strategy and communicate them to the public in a comprehensible and credible\nfashion. I am concerned that we would create more confusion than clarity. One statement of a\nsystematic policy would be a much clearer way to conduct policy.\nOthers view thresholds as a way to signal that the FOMC will wait a very long time before\nbeginning to tighten policy. The thought is that this should improve consumer and business\nconfidence in a sustainable recovery and that this will spur increased spending and reduced\nsaving today.\nBut in order for this to work, the public needs to believe that the Fed is making a credible\ncommitment that it will not deviate from, even if it appears to be desirable to do so at the time.\n7\n\n\fAccording to this view of forward guidance, the Fed would be trying to manage the public’s\nexpectations in a fully credible way. I don’t believe there is any empirical evidence that we can\nbe successful with such a strategy or that it would be of any quantitative significance if we\ncould. Moreover, even if the action were credible, for it to be successful, the public must\nunderstand how the Fed is planning to respond to changes in economic conditions after those\nthresholds are reached – that is, they need to understand the Fed’s reaction function. Will the\nFOMC tighten quickly? Or slowly? And on what basis will the FOMC make that decision? So to\nbelieve that this approach to forward guidance will succeed in providing stimulus at the zero\nbound, one must have an extraordinary amount of confidence in the Fed’s ability to manage\nexpectations with complete credibility, even though the Fed has never articulated a systematic\napproach to policy before.\nThe systematic approach I advocate is more transparent than thresholds because it gives the\npublic much more information on how those policy decisions will be made, based on changes in\neconomic conditions. Ironically, had the FOMC articulated and followed this approach before\nthe crisis, it might be easier now to credibly commit to keeping rates lower for longer than the\npublic would typically expect.\nConclusion\nIn summary, I believe that some of the actions the Fed has taken to address the financial crisis\nand the slow economic recovery, while well intentioned, have created some long-term risks for\nthe economy and for the Fed as an institution. Excessive focus on the short term can result in\nlong-term problems. Avoiding these risks is dependent on the Fed executing a graceful exit\nfrom this period of extraordinary accommodation. Such an exit depends on the Fed’s ability to\nbe systematic and transparent about its policy decisions.\nOver the past several years, the Fed has taken some beneficial steps toward increased\ntransparency, which I believe will serve the economy well now and in the future. I believe the\nFed should continue on this path by more clearly articulating a systematic approach to\npolicymaking, centered on using robust simple rules as guides to both its policy decisions and\nthe way in which it communicates those decisions.\n\n8\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fEconomic Outlook and the Limits of Monetary Policy\nSouthern Chester County Chamber of Commerce\nOctober 11, 2012\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me to speak today at this fall luncheon of the Southern Chester\nCounty Chamber of Commerce. Your group, like so many other chambers of commerce\nthroughout our region, represents diverse segments of our economy and provides\nvaluable support to many businesses and the communities they serve.\nI’d like to share with you some thoughts on the nation’s economy and my assessment of\nthe outlook. I should begin by warning you that providing an economic outlook is\ndifficult even in normal times. It has been even more difficult over the last few years in\nthe wake of the housing collapse and the financial crisis. Thus, I approach my effort to\nprovide clarity about the economic outlook with a healthy dose of humility.\nI will also share some of my views on monetary policy, which also requires a degree of\nhumility. Congress has instructed the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy in a\nmanner to “promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and\nmoderate long-term interest rates.” Yet, I am concerned that over the years, people\nhave come to expect too much from monetary policy. Chairman Bernanke has noted\nmany times that monetary policy is not a panacea for all our economic challenges.\nNevertheless, there are still those who seem to believe otherwise.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC, is the body within the Federal\nReserve responsible for determining monetary policy to meet these mandated goals. By\n1\n\n\fdesign, policy is set by 12 voting members on the FOMC — the seven members of the\nBoard of Governors in Washington always have a vote, as does the president of the New\nYork Fed. The remaining four votes come from among the other 11 Reserve Bank\npresidents, who serve one-year terms on a rotating basis.\nWhether or not they vote, though, all Reserve Bank presidents contribute to the\ndiscussion. This ensures that the Committee considers a wide range of independent\nassessments of the economy and the policy we should pursue.\nBefore continuing let me note that my views are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the FOMC.\nEconomic Outlook\nSo let me begin with an overview of the economy as we enter the final quarter of 2012.\nWe are now in the third year of the economic expansion that officially began in mid2009. Yet economic growth has come in fits and starts, taking two steps forward, only\nto then stall or take one step back. The general path has continued to be forward, but\nwe’ve made far slower progress than anyone would like.\nThis sluggish growth has had its most profound effect on the millions of Americans and\ntheir families who have lost their jobs. Last Friday, we learned that the unemployment\nrate improved to 7.8 percent. That’s a better outcome than many had expected. And it\nis the lowest unemployment rate since January 2009. Yet, there are still millions of\nunemployed and many others who have dropped out of the labor force.\nSo far, in 2012, employment growth has averaged 146,000 jobs per month, compared\nwith an average monthly gain of 153,000 in 2011. While the economy continues to add\njobs, we are simply not making progress as fast as we would like.\nIn order for labor market conditions to improve, we need to have faster overall real\ngrowth in the economy. We finished 2011 on a strong note, with 4.1 percent growth in\nthe fourth quarter. But growth of real gross domestic product slowed to 2 percent in\n2\n\n\fthe first quarter of this year and then to 1.3 percent in the second quarter. We are\nlikely on a trajectory that will lead to growth of about 2 percent for the full year.\nI anticipate that the pace of growth will pick up somewhat to about 3 percent in 2013\nand 2014 – a pace that is slightly above trend. This should allow for some steady\nimprovement in labor markets and lead to a gradual decline in the unemployment rate.\nBut we need to keep in mind the size and nature of the shocks that hit the economy.\nThe economy lost 8.8 million jobs from the peak of employment in January 2008 to the\nemployment trough in February 2010. We have regained fewer than half of these jobs.\nIn my view, we will not see greater job gains and a more rapid recovery until a number\nof adjustments occur. These required adjustments arise from the nature of the shocks\nwe experienced. And I believe these adjustments are unlikely to be significantly\naccelerated through government policies, especially monetary policy.\nWe entered into this recession over-invested in the housing and financial sectors. Those\nsectors are shrinking as a share of the economy, and labor and capital must be\nreallocated to other uses. The labor force needs to be at least partially retooled to\nmatch the skills employers demand. This adjustment takes time. It is painful to be sure,\nbut it will lead to a healthier economy in the long run.\nConsumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the nation’s GDP. So without\nrobust consumer spending, the economy will be sluggish. Here too, the nature of the\nfinancial crisis and the recession play an important role in understanding the slow\nrecovery to date and the underlying adjustments that are occurring. The housing\ncollapse that precipitated the crisis destroyed a lot of the equity that families had built\nup in their homes. Thus, a huge chunk of their savings vanished. Many households had\nbeen counting on their savings to help send their children to college or to help fund\ntheir retirement. With that wealth gone, it is only natural, and rational, for consumers\nto want to rebuild savings. Consequently, private savings rates have risen substantially\nand consumption by households has been restrained.\n3\n\n\fTo be specific, between 2000 and 2007, private savings averaged less than 5 percent of\nGDP, whereas between 2008 and 2011, this savings rate averaged 7½ percent. This\ndesire to save for the future rather than spend today is a drag on near-term growth but\nis good for longer-term growth prospects. I believe consumers are unlikely to provide a\nvery robust boost to current demand until the health of their balance sheets has\nsignificantly improved.\nManufacturing activity has also been sluggish. Firms have been unwilling to invest and\nhire to any significant degree. For example, the Philadelphia Fed’s monthly Business\nOutlook Survey of manufacturers has been a useful barometer of national trends in\nmanufacturing over many years. The survey’s general activity index posted a few\nnegative readings in the summer of 2011 surrounding the congressional debate over the\ndebt ceiling and then returned to positive numbers last fall through this spring. We\nhave seen a return to negative numbers over the past five months. Still, the most\nrecent readings have been improving, and September’s survey indicated that\nmanufacturing activity in the region was essentially flat from the prior month. A bright\nspot is that the survey’s indicators of future activity six months ahead have remained\npositive throughout the recovery. In fact, the September future activity index showed a\nnice bounce up, suggesting that manufacturers have regained their optimism. We will\nsee if these trends continue when the October results come out next week.\nOf course, the weakness in domestic consumer demand is one reason for the sluggish\ngrowth in the manufacturing sector. Another reason is the slowdown in global demand,\ndue in large part to the economic turmoil in Europe, which is hovering near recession.\nThis slowdown, combined with the weakness here at home, has restrained world trade.\nIn the early part of our recovery, U.S. exports boosted manufacturing. Now with the\nslowdown in Europe, U.S. exports have slackened and, with it, our manufacturing sector.\nUncertainty is another factor restraining growth. The fiscal issues in Europe remain\nunresolved. While leaders in Europe have, so far, avoided the financial implosion that\nsome fear, they are far from resolving the underlying fiscal issues they confront.\n4\n\n\fOf course, uncertainty is not limited to Europe. Many U.S. firms have taken a wait-andsee attitude with respect to hiring and investing as businesses and consumers wait to\nsee how our own fiscal problems will be resolved. Will tax rates rise or will spending be\ncut? Or will we see some combination of the two? U.S. fiscal policy is clearly on an\nunsustainable path that must be corrected. Yet, there remains significant uncertainty\nabout the choices that will be made. And that uncertainty is a drag on near-term\ngrowth.\nFinally, in terms of the prospects for near-term growth, I should mention the effects of\nthe drought in the Midwest on this year’s crops. Estimates vary, but the drought will\nprobably cut about half a percentage point off growth in the second half of this year, but\nthe return to normal conditions will boost growth by a similar amount over the first half\nof next year.\nIn case you didn’t notice, nowhere in my list of factors restraining growth did I mention\nthat financial conditions were too restrictive. Indeed, interest rates are at historic lows,\nand markets are generally functioning well. Therefore, I do not believe a lack of\nmonetary accommodation is restraining near-term growth prospects – a point I will\nreturn to shortly.\nTurning to inflation, it has been running near our longer-term goal of 2 percent.\nAlthough the drought in the Midwest and higher gasoline prices are likely to push up\ninflation in the near term, these effects should be transitory. Thus, I do not see a risk of\nhigher inflation, or deflation, in the near term. Indeed, over the medium to longer term,\nI expect inflation to be near our 2 percent target. But this expectation is based on my\nassessment that the appropriate monetary policy is likely to become tighter more\nquickly than the Committee anticipated in its latest statement. Thus, I do see some risks\nto inflation in the longer run, given the current stance of monetary policy.\n\n5\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to monetary policy. The Fed has put into place an extraordinary\namount of accommodation to support the recovery over the past few years. It has kept\nthe federal funds rate near zero for nearly four years; it has more than tripled the size of\nits balance sheet through two rounds of asset purchases; and it is implementing a\nmaturity extension program, known as “operation twist,” which is lengthening the\nmaturity of our holdings of Treasury securities. These actions have dramatically\nchanged the composition of the Fed’s portfolio from mainly short-term Treasuries\nbefore the crisis to mostly longer-term Treasuries and housing-related securities today.\nIn September, the FOMC began a third round of quantitative easing, commonly known\nas QE3, with an open-ended plan to purchase $40 billion of additional agency mortgagebacked securities per month. The FOMC statement indicated that the Fed would make\nthese purchases and more and would employ other policy tools as appropriate until the\noutlook for the labor market improves substantially within a context of price stability. I\ninterpret “within a context of price stability” to mean so long as the inflation outlook\nremains near the Committee’s goal of 2 percent. The FOMC statement also said that\nthe Committee expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain\nappropriate for a considerable period after the economic recovery strengthens. It also\nstated that the Committee currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the\nfederal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\nThere is a reason for telling the public that the Committee expects to keep substantial\naccommodation in place even after the recovery strengthens. The Fed is hoping to\nreassure households and businesses that the recovery will remain intact, even in the\nface of future adverse shocks. This should induce households and firms to spend more\ntoday rather than save, which should, in turn, spur hiring.\nHowever, I opposed the Committee’s actions in September because I believe that\nincreasing monetary policy accommodation is neither appropriate nor likely to be very\n6\n\n\feffective in the current environment. Every monetary policy action has costs and\nbenefits, and my assessment is that the potential costs and risks associated with these\nactions outweigh the potential benefits.\nWhile the unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated above FOMC participants’\nestimates of its longer-run level for some time, it is not at all clear that monetary policy\ncan speed that transition. In other words, the slow pace of the recovery should not be\ntaken as evidence that the stance of monetary policy is inappropriate or that ever more\naggressive accommodation can speed up that pace.\nIndeed, many economists expect that further asset purchases by the Fed are unlikely to\nreduce long-term interest rates by a significant amount; some studies suggest that the\neffect will be quite small and transitory. Given our current economic situation and my\nreading of the empirical evidence, I share this skepticism and so do not believe that\nattempts to lower interest rates by a few more basis points will spur further growth or\nhigher employment.\nBusiness leaders who have talked to me continue to cite uncertainty about fiscal\ndecisions – here and abroad – as the greatest hindrance to hiring and investment. None\nthink that lowering nominal interest rates by a few basis points will alter their behavior.\nHopefully, the uncertainties will abate over time, but the central bank can do little to\nalleviate them.\nAnd as far as households are concerned, it seems unlikely that a small drop in interest\nrates will overcome the strong desire to save and, instead, induce households to spend\nmore. In fact, driving down interest rates may encourage consumers to save even more\nto make up for lower returns.\nThus, in my view, we are unlikely to see much benefit to growth or to employment from\nfurther asset purchases. If I am right, then conveying the idea that such an action will\nhelp speed up the recovery risks the Fed’s credibility. This can be quite costly: If the\n\n7\n\n\fpublic loses confidence in the central bank, our ability to set effective monetary policy in\nthe future will be harmed and households and businesses will feel the consequences.\nContinued expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet has other costs as well. By greatly\nexpanding the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, the new asset-purchase program will\nexacerbate the challenges that the Fed will face when it comes time to exit this period\nof extraordinary accommodation. I have been a student of monetary theory and policy\nfor over 30 years. One constant is that central banks tend to find it easier to lower\ninterest rates than to raise them. Moreover, identifying turning points is difficult even\nin the best of times, so timing the change in the direction of policy is always a challenge.\nBut this time, exit will be even more complicated and risky. With such a large balance\nsheet, our exit strategy will involve using tools we have not used before, such as the\ninterest rate on reserves, term deposits, and asset sales. At this point, it is impossible to\nknow whether such asset sales will be disruptive to the market.\nA rapid tightening of monetary policy may also entail political risks for the Fed. We\nwould likely be selling the longer maturity assets in our portfolio at a loss, meaning that\nwe may be unable to make any remittances to the U.S. Treasury for some years. Yet, if\nwe don’t tighten quickly enough, we could find ourselves far behind the curve in\nrestraining inflation.\nWhile these risks are very hard to quantify, it is clear that the larger the Fed’s portfolio\nbecomes, the greater the risk and the potential costs when it comes time to exit. And\nbased on my economic outlook, that time may come well before mid-2015. In my view,\nto keep the funds rate at zero that long would risk destabilizing inflation expectations\nand lead to an unwanted increase in inflation. In fact, some are interpreting the FOMC’s\nstatement that we will keep accommodation in place for a considerable time after the\nrecovery strengthens as an indication that the Fed is focused on trying to lower the\nunemployment rate and is willing to tolerate higher inflation to do so. This is another\nrisk to the hard-won credibility the institution has built up over many years, which, if\nlost, will undermine economic stability. We know that monetary policy can control\n8\n\n\finflation, but its ability to manage the unemployment rate is far more dubious. Chasing\nan elusive goal for unemployment could well risk losing control over inflation. That was\nthe lesson of the Great Inflation during the 1970s.\nFinally, I also opposed September’s decision to purchase additional mortgage-backed\nsecurities. In general, central banks should refrain from allocating credit toward one\nsector or industry. Those types of credit-allocation decisions rightfully belong to the\nfiscal authorities, not the central bank. Engaging in such actions endangers our\nindependence and the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2013 and 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve only gradually. I believe inflation\nexpectations will be relatively stable and inflation will remain at moderate levels in the\nnear term. However, with the very accommodative stance of monetary policy in place\nfor nearly four years, we must guard against the medium- and longer-term risks of\ninflation and the further distortions such accommodation can create in the financial\nmarkets.\nThe Fed’s most recent actions carry significant risks. I am not forecasting that those\nrisks will necessarily materialize, and I hope they will not. But if they do, they could\nprove quite costly to the economy. It is therefore important that we understand those\nrisks and evaluate them in assessing policy. A common error in policymaking is an\nexcessive focus on the short term and an underestimation of the longer-term\nconsequences of policy choices. I take the longer-term risks I have outlined today quite\nseriously. In my view, the potential costs outweigh what appear to be meager potential\nbenefits of further asset purchases and extended forward guidance.\nI’d like to close with a quotation from the Nobel Prize-winning economist, and my\nformer teacher, Milton Friedman. While the quote is now over 40 years old, I believe it\n9\n\n\fis as applicable today as when Milton admonished our profession on the limits of\nmonetary policy in his presidential address to the American Economic Association:\n“….we are in danger of assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform, in\ndanger of asking it to accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and, as a result, in danger\nof preventing it from making the contribution that it is capable of making.” ∗\n\n∗\n\nMilton Friedman, “The Role of Monetary Policy,” American Economic Review, 58:1 (March 1968), pp.\n1‐17.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fEconomic Outlook and Monetary Policy\nCFA Society of Philadelphia/The Bond Club of Philadelphia\nSeptember 25, 2012\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nLet me welcome you all to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and to thank both\nthe CFA Society and the Bond Club for inviting me to speak today. In October of 2006, I\ngave my first speech as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to the CFA\nSociety of Philadelphia. Well, a lot has happened since then, and the world is a different\nplace. So I will use my time with you today to offer my perspective on the current state\nof the economy and monetary policy.\nOur gathering comes at an opportune time, since less than two weeks ago, I participated\nin the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or the FOMC,\nwhich, as you know, is the body within the Federal Reserve responsible for determining\nmonetary policy.\nFour times a year, and most recently at our last meeting, FOMC participants submit\ntheir economic projections for output growth, inflation, and unemployment, based on\ntheir latest assessments of appropriate monetary policy. The Summary of Economic\nProjections, or SEP, gives a perspective on participants’ views of how monetary policy\ncan best achieve the goals that Congress has set forth for it. Specifically, the Federal\nReserve Act states that the Fed should conduct monetary policy to “promote effectively\nthe goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest\nrates.” Since moderate long-term interest rates generally result when prices are stable\nand the economy is operating at full employment, it is often said that Congress has\ngiven the Fed a dual mandate.\n1\n\n\fMonetary policy actions generally affect the economy with a lag, so the FOMC must be\nforward-looking in calibrating the appropriate stance of policy. Therefore, I want to\nbegin my remarks with a review of the nation’s economic recovery and my outlook for\ngrowth and inflation. I will then offer some observations on current monetary policy,\nincluding the actions announced at our last meeting.\nBefore continuing, I should note that my views are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the FOMC.\nEconomic Outlook\nSo let me begin with the state of our economy. We have now seen three years of\neconomic expansion since mid-2009 when the recession officially ended. Yet, no one\nwould describe our nation’s economic state of affairs as satisfactory. Economic growth\nhas come in fits and starts, taking two steps forward, only to then take one step back.\nMost disheartening is that the unemployment rate remains high, affecting millions of\nAmericans and their families.\nAfter finishing 2011 with 4.1 percent growth in the fourth quarter, growth of real gross\ndomestic product slowed to 2 percent in the first quarter of this year, and then to 1.7\npercent in the second quarter. We are likely on a trajectory that will lead to growth of\nabout 2 percent for the full year.\nLooking out a little further, I anticipate that the pace of growth will pick up somewhat to\nabout 3 percent in 2013 and 2014 – a pace that is slightly above trend. That outlook\nplaces me near the high end of the central tendency of FOMC participants’ forecasts for\n2013 and near the low end for 2014. In September’s projections, the central tendency\nshowed real GDP growth of 1.7 to 2 percent this year, followed by growth of 2.5 to 3\npercent in 2013 and 3 to 3.8 percent in 2014 and 2015.\nOne temporary factor contributing to sluggish growth in the very near term is the\ndrought in the Midwest and its effects on this year’s crops. Estimates vary, but the\n2\n\n\fdrought will probably cut about half a percentage point off growth in the second half of\nthis year.\nSluggish manufacturing activity has been another reason for the recent moderating\ngrowth estimates. The Philadelphia Fed’s monthly Business Outlook Survey of\nmanufacturers has been a useful barometer of national trends in manufacturing over\nmany years. The survey’s general activity index posted a few negative readings last\nsummer and then returned to positive numbers through this spring. We saw a return to\nnegative territory this summer. While the readings for the past five months have been\nnegative, the recent readings have been improving, and the latest survey suggests that\nmanufacturing activity in the region was essentially flat from August to September.\nDespite weak current activity, the survey’s indicators of activity six months ahead have\nremained positive throughout this recovery and showed a nice bounce up in the\nSeptember report, suggesting that manufacturers are optimistic about the future.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation’s GDP, also\ncontinues to make modest gains. In July, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that\npersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $46 billion, or 0.4 percent. That\nfollowed a weak reading in June, when consumer spending increased just $3.5 billion.\nWe need to keep in mind, though, the extent of the shocks from the financial crisis and\nthe ensuing recession. The housing bust that precipitated the crisis destroyed a lot of\nhousehold wealth. It is only natural for consumers to want to rebuild the savings that\nwere lost as a result of the decline in housing wealth – savings they might have used to\nsend their children to college or to help fund their retirement. Consequently, private\nsavings rates have risen substantially. Between 2000 and 2007, private savings\naveraged less than 5 percent of GDP, and between 2008 and 2011, the savings rate\naveraged 7½ percent. Thus, it is not surprising that consumers are not the engine of\ngrowth they normally are in economic expansions. And they are unlikely to provide a\nvery robust boost to demand until the health of their balance sheets has been\nsignificantly improved.\n3\n\n\fThere are, however, encouraging signs that the housing sector is beginning to improve.\nOf course, we entered the recession over-invested in residential real estate, and we are\nnot likely to see a strong housing recovery until the surplus inventory of foreclosed and\ndistressed properties declines. Moreover, we should not want housing activity to return\nto those heady days of 2005 and 2006. Such activity was unsustainable and a prime\ncontributor to the financial meltdown.\nOn the labor front, the pace of employment growth this year hasn’t been strong enough\nto have much of an effect on the unemployment rate. Firms added an average of\n226,000 jobs per month in the first quarter of the year. This slowed considerably to just\n67,000 jobs a month, on average, in the second quarter. Through the first two months\nof the third quarter, employment has picked up slightly, to about 118,000 a month. At\n8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is still elevated, but we should remember that it is\na full percentage point lower than it was at this time last year.\nIn the FOMC’s economic projections in September, the FOMC participants’ central\ntendency suggested that unemployment in the fourth quarter would be close to where\nwe are now, between 8 and 8.2 percent, and then fall gradually to between 6 and 6.8\npercent by the end of 2015. My own forecast is at the low end of that central tendency.\nI wish we had better numbers to report. The sizable shocks that hit the economy\nresulted in a loss of 8.8 million jobs from the peak of employment in January 2008 to the\nemployment trough in February 2010. We have regained fewer than half of these jobs.\nIn my view, unfortunately the frictions and structural adjustments that are holding back\nimprovements in labor markets cannot be cured by monetary policy, nor can monetary\npolicy do much to speed up the slow progress we are making on the labor front.\nTurning to inflation, it has been running near our longer-term goal of 2 percent.\nAlthough the drought in the Midwest and higher gasoline prices are likely to push up\ninflation in the near term, these effects should be transitory. Thus, I do not see much\nevidence that we will have an outbreak of inflation in the near term, nor do I see\n4\n\n\felevated risks of deflation. Indeed, over the medium to longer term, I expect inflation to\nbe near our 2 percent target. But this expectation is incumbent on appropriate\nmonetary policy, and my assessment is that the appropriate policy is likely to be tighter\ngoing forward than anticipated by the Committee at this point. Thus, I do see some\nrisks to inflation in the longer run given the current stance of monetary policy, as I will\ndiscuss in a few moments.\nOf course, other risks cloud the forecast. While the recent policy actions in Europe may\nhave calmed markets and eased financial conditions somewhat, many fundamental\nissues remain unresolved. Thus, there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to whether\nthe Europeans will make the difficult choices needed to put Europe back on a\nsustainable fiscal path.\nOur own fiscal policy is also uncertain. While I believe we will avoid the worst-case\nscenarios related to falling off the fiscal cliff, the U.S. needs to forge a path toward\nsustainable fiscal policy. These uncertainties constitute significant hurdles for the\neconomy and are retarding near-term growth.\nMonetary Policy\nLet me now turn to some thoughts on monetary policy. Even before the actions taken\nthis month, the Fed had put into place an extraordinary amount of accommodation to\nsupport the recovery. The Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero for more than\n45 months; it has completed two rounds of asset purchases that more than tripled the\nsize of the Fed’s balance sheet; and it is implementing a maturity extension program,\nknown as “operation twist,” which is lengthening the maturity of our holdings of\nTreasury securities. These actions have changed the composition of the portfolio from\nmainly short-term Treasuries before the crisis to mostly longer-term Treasuries and\nhousing-related securities today.\nMany of these actions were taken at the height of the financial crisis and during the\nensuing deep recession. But the financial crisis has substantially abated and the\n5\n\n\feconomy has been healing, if somewhat more slowly than we would like. In fact, if you\ncompare today’s economic and financial conditions to the conditions that prevailed\nwhen the FOMC previously took bold actions, you will see that the economy is\nundoubtedly in a better position.\nAt its latest meeting in September, the FOMC decided to begin a third round of\nquantitative easing, commonly known as QE3, with the purchase of additional agency\nmortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The FOMC statement\nindicated that if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the\nFed would make these purchases and more and would employ other policy tools as\nappropriate until such improvement is achieved within a context of price stability. I\ninterpret “within a context of price stability” to mean so long as the inflation outlook\nremains near the Committee’s goal of 2 percent. The FOMC statement also said that\nthe Committee expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain\nappropriate for a considerable period after the economic recovery strengthens. It also\nstated that the Committee currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the\nfederal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.\nThe Committee’s decision was based on the view that with unemployment far above the\nlevel typically seen in normal times and inflation near its goal, increasing the amount of\nmonetary accommodation should help bring unemployment down without jeopardizing\nour inflation goal. And since the Fed said it expects to keep substantial accommodation\nin place even after the recovery strengthens, people and businesses should be\nreassured that the recovery will remain intact, even in the face of future adverse shocks.\nThis should make households and firms comfortable spending more today rather than\nsaving, which should, in turn, spur hiring.\nI opposed the Committee’s actions in September because I believe that increasing\nmonetary policy accommodation is neither appropriate nor likely to be effective in the\ncurrent environment. Every monetary policy action has costs and benefits, and my\n\n6\n\n\fassessment is that the potential costs and risks associated with these actions outweigh\nthe potential meager benefits.\nGiven the magnitude and nature of the shocks that hit our economy, one should not be\nparticularly surprised by the slow recovery. Both the housing and the financial sectors\nsuffered large declines, and it will take time for the economy to adjust. While\nunemployment is expected to remain above FOMC participants’ range of estimates of\nits longer-run level for some time, it is not at all clear that monetary policy can speed up\nthat transition. In other words, the slow pace of the recovery should not be taken as\nevidence that the stance of monetary policy is inappropriate or that ever more\naggressive accommodation can speed up that pace.\nIndeed, many economists expect that further asset purchases by the Fed are unlikely to\nreduce long-term interest rates by a significant amount; some studies suggest that the\neffect will be quite small and transitory. Given our current economic situation and my\nreading of the empirical evidence, I do not believe that lowering interest rates by a few\nmore basis points will spur further growth or higher employment. Business leaders who\nhave talked to me continue to cite uncertainty about fiscal decisions – here and abroad\n– as the greatest hindrance to hiring and investment. Hopefully these uncertainties will\nabate over time, but the central bank can do little to alleviate them.\nAnd as far as households are concerned, they continue to try to repair their balance\nsheets in the wake of substantial losses of housing wealth, as I indicated earlier. They\nare deleveraging and saving more. It seems unlikely that a small drop in interest rates\nwill overturn the strong desire to save and, instead, induce households to spend more.\nIn fact, driving down interest rates even further may encourage consumers to save even\nmore to make up for lower returns.\nThus, in my view, we are unlikely to see much benefit to growth or to employment from\nfurther asset purchases. If I am right, then conveying the idea that such action will have\na substantive impact on labor markets and the speed of the recovery risks the Fed’s\n7\n\n\fcredibility. This is quite costly: If the public loses confidence in the central bank, our\nability to set effective monetary policy in the future will be harmed and households and\nbusinesses will feel the consequences.\nThe recent actions risk the Fed’s credibility in other ways as well. The rationale for the\nactions leading to increased spending today depends on the Fed’s ability to convince the\npublic that it will conduct policy in a fundamentally different way than it has in the past.\nPeople must believe that we will delay raising interest rates compared to when we\nnormally would and, by so doing, make the economy stronger than it otherwise would\nbe. At the same time, people must believe that we will ensure that inflation\nexpectations do not take off and threaten longer-run price stability. Making such a\nchange in the policy regime believable will be very hard to do. If the public doesn’t\nbelieve that we will delay raising rates, they won’t bring spending forward and the\npolicy will be ineffective. But if they do believe we will delay raising rates, they may\ninfer that the Fed is willing to tolerate considerably higher inflation. This may spur an\nincrease in inflation expectations, which would require a response from the FOMC, or\nelse risk the credibility of its commitment to keep inflation low and stable. I do not\nthink it prudent to risk that hard-won credibility. The subtlety and complexity of\nsuccessfully managing expectations in this manner make this quite a risky policy strategy\nin my view, with little evidence of quantitatively meaningful results for employment.\nContinued expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet has other costs as well. By greatly\nexpanding the size of the Fed’s balance sheet, the new asset-purchase program will\nexacerbate the challenges that the Fed will face when it comes time to exit this period\nof extraordinary accommodation, risking higher inflation and harm to the Fed’s\nreputation and credibility. I have been a student of monetary theory and policy for over\n30 years. One constant is that central banks tend to find it easier to lower interest rates\nthan to raise them. Moreover, identifying turning points is difficult even in the best of\ntimes, so timing the change in the direction of policy is always a challenge. But this\ntime, exit will be even more complicated and risky. With such a large balance sheet, our\n\n8\n\n\ftransition from very accommodative policies to less accommodative policies will involve\nusing tools we have not used before, such as the interest rate on reserves, term\ndeposits, and asset sales. Once the recovery takes off, long rates will begin to rise and\nbanks will begin lending the large volume of excess reserves sitting in their accounts at\nthe Fed. This loan growth can be quite rapid, as was true after the banking crisis in the\n1930s, and there is some risk that the Fed will need to withdraw accommodation very\naggressively in order to contain inflation. At this point, it is impossible to know whether\nsuch asset sales will be disruptive to the market. A rapid tightening of monetary policy\nmay also entail political risks for the Fed. We would likely be selling the longer maturity\nassets in our portfolio at a loss, meaning that we may be unable to make any\nremittances to the U.S. Treasury for some years. Yet, if we don’t tighten quickly enough,\nwe could find ourselves far behind the curve in restraining inflation.\nWhile these risks are very hard to quantify, it is clear that the larger the Fed’s portfolio\nbecomes, the higher the risk and the potential costs when it comes time to exit. And\nbased on my economic outlook, that time may come well before mid-2015. In my view,\nto keep the funds rate at zero that long would risk destabilizing inflation expectations\nand lead to an unwanted increase in inflation. In fact, some are interpreting the FOMC’s\nstatement that we will keep accommodation in place for a considerable time after the\nrecovery strengthens as an indication that the Fed is focused on trying to lower the\nunemployment rate and is willing to tolerate higher inflation to do so. This is another\nrisk to the hard-won credibility the institution has built up over many years, which, if\nlost, will undermine economic stability.\nSome of my colleagues on the FOMC have advocated giving quantitative triggers or\nthresholds for the level of unemployment and inflation to explain the economic\nconditions that would lead the Fed to consider a change in policy stance. For example,\nthe Fed might indicate that extraordinary accommodation would remain in place if\nunemployment were above, say, X percent, so long as its outlook for medium-run\ninflation was not higher than, say, Y percent.\n\n9\n\n\fI believe that policy should be state-contingent and systematic, and that the FOMC\nshould strive to explain its policy reaction function – how it expects to change policy as\neconomic conditions change. A Taylor rule is one such reaction function, but research\nindicates that other simple rules are good guides to policy even when the true model of\nthe economy is uncertain. These rules involve policy responding aggressively to\ndeviations of inflation from its target and also responding to deviations of output from\nsome concept of its potential. In addition, the rules tend to involve some smoothing of\nthe policy rate over time rather than sharp jumps in rates. Using such robust rules as\nguides to policy is, in my view, the appropriate way to communicate policy guidance. As\na result, as many of you know, I have never been an advocate of calendar-date forward\nguidance. I thought it was a mistake when we implemented that language, and it\nremains a nettlesome communication problem.\nBut while the unemployment-inflation thresholds do move away from calendar-date\nguidance and toward economic conditions, they fall short of a reaction function that I\nwould like to see, since they say nothing about how monetary policy will change after\nsuch levels are reached. Will the FOMC tighten quickly? Or slowly? How will the\nCommittee decide? In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only factor to\nconsider in judging the state of labor markets. Indeed, it fell two-tenths of a percentage\npoint in August, yet few think that represented improved labor market conditions. The\nreduction stemmed from a decrease in the participation rate rather than an increase in\nemployment. In addition, I am not convinced that the inflation trigger would prove to\nbe much of a constraint. While the unemployment trigger is based on the current value,\nthe inflation trigger is based on the outlook for inflation, and if monetary policy is being\nset appropriately, this outlook should be consistent with price stability. Thus, I believe\nthat using thresholds or triggers could easily put us behind the curve, if we have a\ntendency to underestimate future inflation.\nFinally, I also opposed September’s decision to purchase additional mortgage-backed\nsecurities. In general, central banks should refrain from preferential support for one\n\n10\n\n\fsector or industry over another. Those types of credit-allocation decisions rightfully\nbelong to the fiscal authorities, not the central bank. Engaging in such actions\nendangers our independence and the effectiveness of monetary policy.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2013 and 2014.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve only gradually. I believe inflation\nexpectations will be relatively stable and inflation will remain at moderate levels in the\nnear term. However, with the very accommodative stance of monetary policy in place\nfor nearly four years, we must guard against the medium- and longer-term risks of\ninflation and the further distortions such accommodation can create.\nThe Fed’s most recent actions carry with them significant risks. I am not forecasting that\nthose risks will necessarily materialize and I hope they will not. But if they do, they\ncould prove quite costly to the economy. It is therefore important that we understand\nthose risks and evaluate them in assessing policy. A common error in policymaking is an\nexcessive focus on the short term and an underestimation of the longer-term\nconsequences of policy choices. I take the longer-term risks I have outlined today quite\nseriously. In my view, the potential costs outweigh what appear to be meager potential\nbenefits of further asset purchases and extended forward guidance.\nIt is important that the Fed’s policymaking remain credible to the public. This has\nimportant benefits to our economy. I believe the FOMC should continue to work\ntoward increasing the public’s understanding of how policy will react systematically to\nchanges in economic conditions using robust rules. Improving the transparency of our\nmonetary policy decision-making process will help to improve the effectiveness of\nmonetary policy and the Fed’s accountability to the public. Thus, I would prefer that we\npursue such systematic rules rather than simple thresholds or triggers.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nGood afternoon. It is indeed a pleasure to be with you today. I want to thank President\nWeidmann for his hospitality, and Dr. Heinz Herrmann and the staff of the Bundesbank\nfor inviting the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia to co-organize the\nBundesbank’s 2012 Spring Conference. The conference papers address a multitude of\nissues that confront the current state of macroeconomics, and the discussion over the\npast two days shows that researchers are making important strides in understanding the\nmacroeconomy. After spending over 30 years in academia, I have served the last six\nyears as a policymaker trying to apply what economics has taught me. Needless to say, I\npicked a challenging time to undertake such an endeavor. But I have learned that,\ndespite the advances in our understanding of economics, a number of issues remain\nunresolved in the context of modern macro models and their use for policy analysis. In\nmy remarks today, I will touch on some issues facing policymakers that I believe stateof-the-art macro models would do well to confront. Before continuing, I should note\nthat I speak for myself and not the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the\nFederal Open Market Committee.\nMore than 40 years ago, the rational expectations revolution in macroeconomics helped\nto shape a consensus among economists that only unanticipated shifts in monetary\npolicy can have real effects. According to this consensus, only monetary surprises affect\nthe real economy in the short to medium run because consumers, workers, employers,\nand investors cannot respond quickly enough to offset the effect of these policy actions\non consumption, the labor market, and investment. 1\n\n1\n\nSee Sargent (1996).\n1\n\n\fBut over the years this consensus view on the transmission mechanism of monetary\npolicy to the real economy has evolved. The current generation of macro models,\nreferred to as New Keynesian DSGE models,2 rely on real and nominal frictions to\ntransmit not only unanticipated but also systematic changes in monetary policy to the\neconomy. Unexpected monetary shocks drive movements in output, consumption,\ninvestment, hours worked, and employment in DSGE models. However, in contrast to\nthe earlier literature, it is the relevance of systematic movements in monetary policy\nthat makes these models of so much interest for policy analysis. Systematic policy\nchanges are represented in these models by Taylor-type rules, in which the policy\ninterest rate responds to changes in inflation and a measure of real activity, such as\noutput growth. Armed with forecasts of inflation and output growth, a central bank can\nassess the impact that different policy rate paths may have on the economy. The ability\nto do this type of policy analysis helps explain the widespread use of New Keynesian\nDSGE models at central banks around the world.\nThese modern macro models stress the importance of credibility and systematic policy,\nas well as forward-looking rational agents, in the determination of economic outcomes.\nIn doing so, they offer guidance to policymakers about how to structure policies that will\nimprove the policy framework and, therefore, economic performance. Nonetheless, I\nthink there is room for improving the models and the advice they deliver on policy\noptions. Before discussing several of these improvements, it is important to appreciate\nthe “rules of the game” of the New Keynesian DSGE framework.\nThe New Keynesian Framework\nNew Keynesian DSGE models are the latest update to real business cycle, or RBC, theory.\nGiven my own research in this area, it probably does not surprise many of you that I find\nthe RBC paradigm a useful and valuable platform on which to build our macroeconomic\nmodels. 3 One goal of real business cycle theory is to study the predictions of dynamic\ngeneral equilibrium models, in which optimizing and forward-looking consumers,\nworkers, employers, and investors are endowed with rational expectations. A\nshortcoming many see in the simple real business cycle model is its difficulty in\ninternally generating persistent changes in output and employment from a transitory or\ntemporary external shock to, say, productivity. 4 The recognition of this problem has\n2\n\nDSGE stands for dynamic stochastic general equilibrium.\n\n3\n\nSee Long and Plosser (1983) and King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988a, b).\n\n4\n\nSee King and Plosser (1994), Rotemberg and Woodford (1995), and Cogley and Nason (1993, 1995).\n2\n\n\finspired variations on the simple model, of which the New Keynesian revival is an\nexample.\nThe approach taken in these models is to incorporate a structure of real and nominal\nfrictions into the real business cycle framework. These frictions are placed in DSGE\nmodels, in part, to make real economic activity respond to anticipated and\nunanticipated changes in monetary policy, at least, in the short to medium run. The real\nfrictions that drive internal propagation of monetary policy often include habit\nformation in consumption, that is, how past consumption influences current\nconsumption; the costs of capital used in production; and the resources expended by\nadding new investment to the existing stock of capital. New Keynesian DSGE models\nalso include the costs faced by monopolistic firms and households when setting their\nprices and nominal wages. A nominal friction often assumed in Keynesian DSGE models\nis that firms and households have to wait a fixed interval of time before they can reset\ntheir prices and wages in a forward-looking, optimal manner. A rule of the game in\nthese models is that the interactions of these nominal frictions with real frictions give\nrise to persistent monetary nonneutralities over the business cycle. 5 It is this monetary\ntransmission mechanism that makes the New Keynesian DSGE models attractive to\ncentral banks.\nAn assumption of these models is that the structure of these real and nominal frictions,\nwhich transmit changes in monetary policy to the real economy, well-approximate the\ntrue underlying rigidities of the actual economy and are not affected by changes in\nmonetary policy. This assumption implies that the frictions faced by consumers,\nworkers, employers, and investors cannot be eliminated at any price they might be\nwilling to pay. Although the actors in actual economies probably recognize the\nincentives they have to innovate — think of the strategy to use continuous pricing on\nline for many goods and services — or to seek insurance to minimize the costs of the\nfrictions, these actions and markets are ruled out by the “rules of the game” of New\nKeynesian DSGE modeling.\nAnother important rule of the game prescribes that monetary policy is represented by\nan interest rate or Taylor-type reaction function that policymakers are committed to\nfollow and that everyone believes will, in fact, be followed. This ingredient of New\nKeynesian DSGE models most often commits a central bank to increase its policy rate\nwhen inflation or output rises above the target set by the central bank. And this\n5\n\nSee Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) and Smets and Wouters (2007).\n3\n\n\fcommitment is assumed to be fully credible according to the rules of the game of New\nKeynesian DSGE models. Policy changes are then evaluated as deviations from the\ninvariant policy rule to which policymakers are credibly committed.\nThe Lucas Critique Revisited with Respect to New Keynesian DSGE Models\nIn my view, the current rules of the game of New Keynesian DSGE models run afoul of\nthe Lucas critique – a seminal work for my generation of macroeconomists and for each\ngeneration since.6 The Lucas critique teaches us that to do policy analysis correctly, we\nmust understand the relationship between economic outcomes and the beliefs of\neconomic agents about the policy regime. Equally important is the Lucas critique’s\nwarning against using models whose structure changes with the alternative government\npolicies under consideration. 7 Policy changes are almost never once and for all. So,\nmany economists would argue that an economic model that maps states of the world to\noutcomes but that does not model how policy shifts across alternative regimes would\nfail the Lucas critique because it would not be policy invariant. 8 Instead, economists\ncould better judge the effects of competing policy options by building models that\naccount for the way in which policymakers switch between alternative policy regimes as\neconomic circumstances change. 9\nFor example, I have always been uncomfortable with the New Keynesian model’s\nassumption that wage and price setters have market power but, at the same time, are\nunable or unwilling to change prices in response to anticipated and systematic shifts in\nmonetary policy. This suggests that the deep structure of nominal frictions in New\nKeynesian DSGE models should do more than measure the length of time that firms and\nhouseholds wait for a chance to reset their prices and wages. 10 Moreover, it raises\n\n6\n\nSee Lucas (1976).\n\n7\n\nThe Lucas critique does not apply to the forecasting problem. An aim of forecasters is to develop models\nimmune from systematic forecast errors instead of models whose structure is immutable in the face of\nshifting policy regimes.\n\n8\n\nSee Cooley, LeRoy, and Raymon (1984), Sargent (1984), Sims (1982, 1987), and Leeper and Zha (2003).\n\n9\n\nSee Leeper and Zha (2003), Cogley and Sargent (2005), Sims and Zha (2006), and Leeper and Davig\n(2006).\n\n10\n\nEconomic history is replete with examples of systematic monetary policy interventions creating\nincentives for consumers, workers, employers, and investors to alter their decision rules and actions,\nincluding the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s, the Great Inflation of the 1970s, and the Volcker\ndisinflation; see Sargent (1983, 1999).\n4\n\n\fquestions about the mechanism by which monetary policy shocks are transmitted to the\nreal economy in these models.\nI might also note here that the evidence from micro data on price behavior is not\nparticularly consistent with the implications of the usual staggered price-setting\nassumptions in these models. 11 When the real and nominal frictions of New Keynesian\nmodels do not reflect the incentives faced by economic actors in actual economies,\nthese models violate the Lucas critique’s policy invariance dictum, and thus, the policy\nadvice these models offer must be interpreted with caution.\nFrom a policy perspective, the assumption that a central bank can always and\neverywhere credibly commit to its policy rule is, I believe, also questionable. While it is\ndesirable for policymakers to do so — and in practice, I seek ways to make policy more\nsystematic and more credible — commitment is a luxury few central bankers ever\nactually have, and fewer still faithfully follow.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, it was quite common to hear in workshops and seminars\nthe criticism that a model didn’t satisfy the Lucas critique. I thought this was often a\ncheap shot because almost no model satisfactorily dealt with the issue. And during a\nperiod when the policy regime was apparently fairly stable — which many argued it\nmostly was during those years — the failure to satisfy the Lucas critique seemed\nsomewhat less troublesome. However, in my view, throughout the crisis of the last few\nyears and its aftermath, the Lucas critique has become decidedly more relevant. Policy\nactions have become increasingly discretionary. Moreover, the financial crisis and\nassociated policy responses have left many central banks operating with their policy rate\nnear the zero lower bound; this means that they are no longer following a systematic\nrule, if they ever were. Given that central bankers are, in fact, acting in a discretionary\nmanner, whether it is because they are at the zero bound or because they cannot or will\nnot commit, how are we to interpret policy advice coming from models that assume full\ncommitment to a systematic rule? I think this point is driven home by noting that a\nnumber of central banks have been openly discussing different regimes, from price-level\ntargeting to nominal GDP targeting. In such an environment where policymakers\nactively debate alternative regimes, how confident can we be about the policy advice\nthat follows from models in which that is never contemplated?\n\n11\n\nSee Maćkowiak and Smets (2009) and Alvarez and Burriel (2010).\n5\n\n\fSome Directions for Furthering the Research Agenda\nWhile I have been pointing out some limitations of DSGE models, I would like to end my\nremarks with six suggestions I believe would be fruitful for the research agenda.\nFirst, I believe we should work to give the real and nominal frictions that underpin the\nmonetary propagation mechanism of New Keynesian DSGE models deeper and more\nempirically supported structural foundations. There is already much work being done on\nthis in the areas of search models applied to labor markets and studies of the behavior\nof prices at the firm level. Many of you at this conference have made significant\ncontributions to this literature.\nSecond, on the policy dimension, the impact of the zero lower bound on central bank\npolicy rates remains, as a central banker once said, a conundrum. The zero lower bound\nintroduces nonlinearity into the analysis of monetary policy that macroeconomists and\npolicymakers still do not fully understand. New Keynesian models have made some\nprogress in solving this problem,12 but a complete understanding of the zero bound\nconundrum involves recasting a New Keynesian DSGE model to show how it can provide\nan economically meaningful story of the set of shocks, financial markets, and frictions\nthat explain the financial crisis, the resulting recession, and the weak recovery that has\nfollowed. This might be asking a lot, but a good challenge usually produces\nextraordinary research.\nThird, we must make progress in our analysis of credibility and commitment. The New\nKeynesian framework mostly assumes that policymakers are fully credible in their\ncommitment to a specified policy rule. If that is not the case in practice, how do\npolicymakers assess the policy advice these models deliver? Policy at the zero lower\nbound is a leading example of this issue. According to the New Keynesian model, zero\nlower bound policies rely on policymakers guiding the public’s expectations of when an\ninitial interest rate increase will occur in the future. If the credibility of this forward\nguidance is questioned, evaluation of the zero lower bound policy has to account for the\npublic's beliefs that commitment to this policy is incomplete. I have found that\npolicymakers like to presume that their policy actions are completely credible and then\nengage in decisions accordingly. Yet if that presumption is wrong, those policies will not\n\n12\n\nSee Braun, Körber, and Waki (2012), Carlstrom, Fuerst, and Paustian (2012), and Fernández-Villaverde,\nGordon, Guerrón-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramírez (2012).\n6\n\n\fhave the desired or predicted outcomes. Is there a way to design and estimate policy\nresponses in such a world? Can reputational models be adapted for this purpose?\nFourth, and related, macroeconomists need to consider how to integrate the\ninstitutional design of central banks into our macroeconomic models. Different designs\npermit different degrees of discretion for a central bank. For example, responsibility for\nsetting monetary policy is often delegated by an elected legislature to an independent\ncentral bank. However, the mandates given to central banks differ across countries. The\nFed is often said to have a dual mandate; some banks have a hierarchal mandate; and\nothers have a single mandate. Yet economists endow their New Keynesian DSGE models\nwith strikingly uniform Taylor-type rules, always assuming complete credibility. Policy\nanalysis might be improved by considering the institutional design of central banks and\nhow it relates to the ability to commit and the specification of the Taylor-type rules that\ngo into New Keynesian models. Central banks with different levels of discretion will\nrespond differently to the same set of shocks.\nLet me offer a slightly different take on this issue. Policymakers are not Ramsey social\nplanners. They are individuals who respond to incentives like every other actor in the\neconomy. Those incentives are often shaped by the nature of the institutions in which\nthey operate. Yet the models we use often ignore both the institutional environment\nand the rational behavior of policymakers. The models often ask policymakers to\nundertake actions that run counter to the incentives they face. How should economists\nthen think about the policy advice their models offer and the outcomes they should\nexpect? How should we think about the design of our institutions? This is not an\nunexplored arena, but if we are to take the policy guidance from our models seriously,\nwe must think harder about such issues in the context of our models.\nThis leads to my fifth suggestion. Monetary theory has given a great deal of thought to\nrules and credibility in the design of monetary policy, but the recent crisis suggests that\nwe need to think more about the design of lender-of-last-resort policy and the\ninstitutional mechanism for its execution. Whether to act as the lender of last resort is\ndiscretionary, but does it have to be so? Are there ways to make it more systematic ex\nante? If so, how?\nMy sixth and final thought concerns moral hazard, which is addressed in only a handful\nof models. Moral hazard looms large when one thinks about lender-of-last-resort\nactivities. But it is also a factor when monetary policy uses discretion to deviate from its\npolicy rule. If the central bank has credibility that it will return to the rule once it has\n7\n\n\fdeviated, this may not be much of a problem. On the other hand, a central bank with\nless credibility, or no credibility, may run the risk of inducing excessive risk-taking. An\nexample of this might be the so-called “Greenspan put,” in which the markets perceived\nthat when asset prices fell, the Fed would respond by reducing interest rates. Do\nmonetary policy actions that appear to react to the stock market induce moral hazard\nand excessive risk-taking? Does having lender-of-last-resort powers influence the central\nbank’s monetary policy decisions, especially at moments when it is not clear whether\nthe economy is in the midst of a financial crisis? Does the combination of lender-of-lastresort responsibilities with discretionary monetary policy create moral hazard perils for\na central bank, encouraging it to take riskier actions? I do not know the answer to these\nquestions, but addressing them and the other challenges I have mentioned with New\nKeynesian DSGE models should prove useful for evaluating the merits of different\ninstitutional designs for central banks.\nConclusion\nThe financial crisis and recession have raised new challenges for policymakers and\nresearchers. The degree to which policy actions, for better or worse, have become\nincreasingly discretionary should give us pause as we try to evaluate policy choices in\nthe context of the workhorse New Keynesian framework, especially given its assumption\nof credibly committed policymakers. Indeed, the Lucas critique would seem to take on\nnew relevance in this post-crisis world. Central banks need to ask if discretionary\npolicies can create incentives that fundamentally change the actions and expectations of\nconsumers, workers, firms, and investors. Characterizing policy in this way also raises\nissues of whether the institutional design of central banks matters for evaluating\nmonetary policy. I hope my comments today encourage you, as well as the wider\ncommunity of macroeconomists, to pursue these research questions that are relevant\nto our efforts to improve our policy choices.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\nAn, Sungbae, and Frank Schorfheide. “Bayesian Analysis of DSGE Models,” Econometric\nReviews, 26 (2007), pp. 113-172.\nAlvarez, Luis J., and Pablo Burriel. “Is a Calvo Price Setting Model Consistent with\nIndividual Price Data?” B.E.

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nOn behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I want to welcome you to the\nReinventing Older Communities conference. This conference is one of our signature\nevents, bringing together a talented and diverse mix of stakeholders who are committed\nto addressing the community and economic development needs of older industrial\ncommunities. This is our fifth Reinventing conference, and these biennial events have\nbecome an important resource for the Federal Reserve System, as they contribute to\nour research and understanding of the interaction between older communities and the\nbroader economy.\nCongress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913 with 12 individual Reserve Banks\noverseen by a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C. One of the strengths of our\nnation’s decentralized central bank is that it gives us roots in Main Streets and\ncommunities across our diverse nation. We are delighted that several other Federal\nReserve Banks share our interest in smaller industrial communities and have partnered\nwith us to sponsor this year’s Reinventing Older Communities conference. So let me\nrecognize and thank the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New\nYork, Richmond, and St. Louis.\nThe past few years have been an extraordinary period for all of us. We have endured a\nfinancial crisis and the worst global recession of the post-war era. This period has\nserved as a striking reminder of how economic forces and decisions – both large and\nsmall – can influence events on Main Streets and neighborhoods across our District and\nour nation.\nYet the economy has now grown for 11 consecutive quarters. To be sure, growth is not\nrobust. But growth in the past year has continued despite significant risks and external\nand internal headwinds. Natural disasters in Japan, a sovereign debt crisis and banking\nproblems in Europe, turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East that led to a steep\nincrease in oil prices, and our own debt ceiling fiasco, all made growth difficult. But I\n1\n\n\falso remind you that the U.S. economy has a history of being remarkably resilient.\nThese shocks held GDP growth to less than 1 percent in the first half of 2011, and many\nanalysts were concerned that the economy was heading toward a double dip. Yet, the\neconomy proved resilient and growth picked up in the second half of the year.\nBuilding Resilient Cities\nWhat leads to such resilience? That is one of the key questions posed in this\nconference, and it is an important one for understanding the prospects for the U.S.\neconomy. We know that older manufacturing cities have suffered from secular declines\nas many of these communities have struggled to find their way in a changing economy.\nThe long-term trends of improved productivity and efficiency in many large-scale\nmanufacturing industries, which are good for the economy as a whole, have led to a\nsecular decline in employment in many of these industries. As a consequence, many\nolder cities with industries that depended heavily on older-style labor-intensive\nproduction processes have felt the brunt of shrinking employment and the loss of an\nindustrial base that provided the economic foundation for their communities. If these\ncommunities are unable to adapt and change, the fallout can include declining\npopulations and tax bases and deteriorating housing markets.\nYet, some of these cities have fared better than others. At least one recent study by the\nMcKinsey Global Institute finds that over the next 15 years, half of worldwide GDP\ngrowth is likely to come from so-called “middleweight cities” – those cities with a\ncurrent population between 150,000 and 10 million. 1 One key to achieving this will be\nto determine how communities can use their strengths and resources to become\nresilient cities.\nBut what does it mean to be resilient?\nOne source defines community resilience as “the individual and collective capacity to\nrespond to adversity and change. It is a community that takes intentional action to\nenhance the personal and collective capacity of its citizens and institutions to respond\nto and influence the course of social and economic change.” 2\nMy interpretation of community resilience is one that, in part, reflects my personal\nexperiences. I was an economics professor at the University of Rochester in Rochester,\nRichard Dobbs, Sven Smit, Jaana Remes, James Manyika, Charles Roxburgh, Alejandra Restre,\n“Urban World: Mapping the Economic Power of Cities,” McKinsey Global Institute (March 2011); available\nat: http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/urbanization/urban_world.\n2\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services:\nhttp://www.samhsa.gov/dtac/dbhis/dbhis_stress/resilience.htm\n1\n\n2\n\n\fNY for many years and served as dean of the William E. Simon Graduate School of\nBusiness from 1993 to 2003. I think it is fair to say that the Eastman Kodak Corporation\nwas to Rochester what the Big Three automakers were to Detroit. Kodak was the\ndominant economic force and employer in Rochester for more than three-quarters of a\ncentury. More generally, over the last several decades, the solid manufacturing base of\nRochester, made up of firms like Kodak, Xerox, and Bausch and Lomb, has steadily\nshrunk. Yet, Rochester ensured that it was not solely dependent on past technologies.\nDuring my time there, Rochester was able to shift its focus from the darkroom to\nmedical imaging and other technologies. New companies were formed around the\nuniversity and area medical centers. Scientists and engineers from these manufacturing\nfirms became entrepreneurs. So even though Kodak’s local employment fell from a\npeak of 61,000 to fewer than 7,000 today, Rochester has exhibited remarkable\nresiliency. In fact, the region has gained 90,000 jobs, on net, over the same period.\nChallenges, of course, remain, as such transformations take a long time.\nRochester is but one example. My hometown of Birmingham, AL, once called the\nPittsburgh of the South, was ravaged by a declining steel industry, as was its larger\nnamesake. Yet it has revived and proved its resiliency. Across the nation, countless\ncities and smaller communities have found ways to use their assets to rebound from\neconomic challenges. The stories and strategies may vary, but there are lessons to be\nlearned.\nThe Research Department at the Philadelphia Fed has begun a research project to\nmeasure urban resilience. Resilience is based on the response of local economic activity\nto an economic shock – whether it be a temporary shock (related to the business cycle\nor some other temporary factor) or a persistent shock (related to long-run trends in\ntechnology, productivity, or preferences). Our researchers are examining two working\ndefinitions of resilience that are grounded in economic theory. According to the first\nmeasure, an area is considered more resilient to the extent that it experiences milder\nfluctuations in employment over the business cycle. According to the second measure,\nresilient areas are those that experience faster employment growth than could be\nexpected based on national growth rates given their industrial structure. The aim of the\nresearch project is to combine these two measures into an index that we will then be\nable to track over time. The project is a work in progress, and it is too soon to share\ndefinitive results. However, the results to date are suggestive. Our researchers have\nfound that larger older cities, especially those in the Northeast and Midwest, have seen\nsmaller fluctuations in their employment cycles than other cities. Detroit was a notable\nexception, having experienced much larger cycles, especially in its declines after 2000.\nSouthern cities score higher on the second resiliency measure, having experienced\n3\n\n\fhigher employment growth, reflecting household migration patterns. Combining the\ntwo measures, Philadelphia scores in the middle of the group of 25 metropolitan areas\nthe staff examined. The next step in the analysis is to examine how the indexes change\nover time and see whether there are certain metropolitan area characteristics that are\ncorrelated with resilience. Early results suggest that industrial diversity is related to\ngreater resilience. As I said, this is a work in progress, and so far, it does look promising.\nOur research in this area is going to be informed by what we learn over the next couple\nof days, as conference participants explore the various ways that these older industrial\ncommunities are marshaling their resources to become resilient cities. Noted academics\nand practitioners from a wide range of disciplines will discuss workforce development,\nsmall business creation, urban education, and housing issues. These panelists will share\nresearch findings, as well as real-world examples of how various strategies and\npartnerships have strengthened their communities. Our presenters will engage you in\nconversations that will challenge your thinking about community development. We\nencourage you to challenge them as you discuss the role of anchor institutions in the\ndevelopment of cities, education reform, and the pursuit of a creative, entrepreneurial,\nand resilient economy.\nThis morning, some of you participated in a tour of Philadelphia’s Kensington\nneighborhood, where you visited two local organizations: Impact Services, an\norganization that has helped more than 24,000 veterans, ex-offenders, and others find\njobs; and the Energy Coordinating Agency of Philadelphia, which provides training so\npeople can pursue jobs in weatherization, energy audits, and lead abatement. Others\nparticipated in a tour of nearby Chester, Pennsylvania, where you saw first-hand how a\ncity is trying to redefine itself by creating new office space, developing a top-notch\nsoccer stadium, and opening a casino to attract businesses and consumers.\nWhile not every strategy will work in every city or every neighborhood, these strategies\nhighlight the human effort that is driving revitalization efforts and the innovation that is\nneeded to truly be resilient in this economy.\nI do want to caution you that resilient and vibrant communities are not just about\ngovernment programs or directed industrial planning by community leaders. Indeed,\none can find instances where government and entrenched interests, seeking to restore\nthe “good old days,” actually slow the innovation and change many communities should\nundertake.\nThe economic strength of our country is deeply rooted in our market-based economy\nand the dynamism and resilience of its citizenry. As we contemplate strategies for\n4\n\n\funleashing the potential in our communities, do not underestimate the importance of\nentrepreneurship and individual initiative to laying the foundations for change and\ngrowth. Government regulations on small and emerging companies can have a stifling\neffect on economic growth, and despite our best intentions, the law of unintended\nconsequences can loom large in any effort to direct or control economic activity. After\nall, we all now know that small businesses are the engines for employment growth and\nsome become very large and successful businesses. So I urge you to look beyond\nplanning and directed investments, all of which may have a place, and look to people:\nhow do we improve education and equip them for a more knowledge-based economy?\nAnd how can we unleash the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of all our citizens? They\nare our most valuable asset and the ultimate source of opportunity and growth. Thank\nyou and I hope you find the next few days informative and enriching.\nIntroduction of Jeremy Nowak\nNow I would like to introduce our next speaker, Jeremy Nowak, president of the William\nPenn Foundation. He has a long history of involvement in community development.\nPrior to joining the foundation, Jeremy was CEO of The Reinvestment Fund, one of the\nmost innovative and successful community investment funds in the country. Yet, he is\nhere not only as an interested and experienced party to your discussions but also as the\nchairman of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Each\nReserve Bank has a nine-member board of directors selected in a nonpartisan way to\nrepresent a cross-section of banking, commercial, and community interests within a\nFederal Reserve District.\nThese directors, by law, not only fulfill a governance role in providing oversight for the\nBank’s performance but also provide valuable insights on economic and financial\nconditions in the District and the nation. These insights help me and my colleagues on\nthe Federal Open Market Committee as we deliberate and seek the best course for\nmonetary policy for the nation.\nI have valued Jeremy’s insights on community and economic issues over the past few\nyears, and I know you will enjoy his perspectives today.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fTransparency and Monetary Policy\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara Economic Forecast Project 2012\nMay 3, 2012\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nI am delighted to be here today and to participate in this event. I first met Peter Rupert\nnearly 30 years ago. He was a Ph.D. student at the University of Rochester when I was\non the faculty there. We were both much younger then. So I was delighted to accept\nhis invitation to come to Santa Barbara. It is also a pleasure to join my fellow presidents\nfrom the Atlanta District and from the home‐team District of San Francisco. I guess that\nmeans I have to be nice to John so I will be allowed back into the District in the future.\n\nI hope you will see that all three of us share many of the same perspectives even though\nwe also have differing views at times. One of the important features of our nation’s\ncentral bank is the strength that comes from the diverse views and experiences that the\nvarious presidents and Governors bring to the table as we grapple with sometimes very\ndifficult and challenging decisions regarding monetary policy. The give and take of our\ndiscussions and the information we share regarding what is happening across our\ngeographically and economically diverse nation lead to better informed and more\nthoughtful decisions. As we share these views with the public in the spirit of\ntransparency, though, we must caution that we always speak for ourselves and not for\nthe Federal Reserve System or our colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nToday, I want to give you my outlook for the economy and then I want to spend time\nsharing some thoughts on the steps the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, has\ntaken to become more transparent about its goals and objectives.\n1\n\n\fFour times a year, each FOMC participant submits projections for real GDP growth,\ninflation, and unemployment. These projections are conditioned on the individual’s\nviews of what sort of monetary policy each believes is appropriate over the forecast\nhorizon given current conditions. Last week, the Fed released the newest Summary of\nEconomic Projections, or SEP. Obviously, with 17 different individuals, it is not\nsurprising that there is a range of views.\n\nSo let me quickly summarize the projections offered for this year and next. The central\ntendency of annual real GDP growth in 2012 ranged from 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent and\nfor 2013 the range was 2.7 to 3.1 percent. This suggests moderate growth this year,\nwith some pick‐up for 2013. The central tendency of the inflation projections was near\n2 percent for 2012 and 2013. The projections for unemployment reflect some\ndifferences. Those projections have unemployment ranging from a low of 7.8 percent\nto a high of 8.0 percent by the end of 2012. Since the unemployment rate currently\nstands at 8.2 percent, having fallen nearly a percentage point since last August, the most\npessimistic forecast says that we will not make much progress this year on further\nreducing unemployment. The more optimistic view seems to be that unemployment\nwill continue to drift down gradually over the remainder of this year. As for the end of\n2013, the central tendency widened somewhat from a low of 7.3 to a high of 7.7\npercent. Again, some expect the unemployment rate to continue a moderate\ndownward path while others are less sanguine. I think it is fair to say that the\nprojections in April represented an upgrade in the near‐term outlook compared to the\nJanuary projections. Indeed, near‐term output and inflation edged up and\nunemployment edged down.\n\nMy own views place me in the slightly more optimistic camp. My outlook is for about 3\npercent growth in both 2012 and 2013. I predict that inflation will hover near or slightly\nabove 2 percent over much of the period. My optimism is most evident in my\n\n2\n\n\fprojections for the unemployment rate. I believe that it will continue to drift down\ngradually, reaching 7.8 percent by the end of this year and near 7 percent by the end of\n2013.\n\nBut truth be told, as always, there remains a great deal of uncertainty in the outlook,\ndespite all our models and talented economists. As physicist Niels Bohr once said:\n“Prediction is very difficult, especially if it is about the future.” Indeed, the Fed has no\ncrystal ball that allows it to see into the future so we have to make policy decisions in\nthe fog of uncertainty, just like everyone else. So I thought I would spend the rest of my\ntime discussing steps the FOMC has taken to become more transparent in the way we\nconduct monetary policy in this uncertain world. While we cannot predict the future,\nwe can and should clearly communicate our objectives and how we are likely to react to\nfuture events.\n\nIn January, the FOMC took two very important steps on its journey to improve\ntransparency and, ultimately, accountability. The first step involves the information\nunderlying our economic projections. Remember I told you that those projections were\nbased on each policymaker’s view of the appropriate path for monetary policy. Prior to\nJanuary, we did not reveal what those paths looked like. The Committee now\nsummarizes the monetary policy assessments that underlie the economic projections of\noutput, inflation, and unemployment. These assessments are what each individual\npolicymaker views as the policy path that is appropriate in achieving the Fed’s longer‐\nterm goals. They are inputs into the policy deliberations that occur at FOMC meetings,\nbut the ultimate policy decisions represent the collective judgment of the Committee\nmembers.\n\nThis addition of the policy assessments to the economic projections has two benefits.\nFirst, having more information on the underlying paths should help the public better\nunderstand the projections. For example, they will have a better understanding of\n\n3\n\n\fwhether inflation is expected to return to the long‐term goal as shocks work their way\nthrough the economy or whether policymakers anticipate that further monetary policy\nactions will be needed to achieve the Committee’s objective.\n\nSecond, as views of appropriate policy in the SEP evolve over time as economic and\nfinancial conditions change, the public will be able to draw better inferences about the\nrelation between current economic conditions, the economic outlook, and appropriate\npolicy. This, then, informs the public about how policy is likely to react in the future to\nchanges in the economy. For example, in April, the SEP indicated that only four\nparticipants now expect the first increase in the federal funds rate will occur after 2014,\ncompared to six in the January projections. These projections of the policy path have\nchanged as the central tendencies of the 2012 projections of growth and inflation were\nrevised up and projections of unemployment were revised down, as I noted earlier.\n\nWe know that when monetary policy is conducted in a systematic way — with a\nsystematic relationship between changes in economic conditions and the policy actions\ntaken by the central bank — policy becomes more transparent and easier to\ncommunicate. And the better the public and the markets understand how policy is\nlikely to be adjusted as the economy changes, the more predictable policy becomes,\nwhich promotes price stability and better economic outcomes. In addition, policy\ntransparency can increase the public’s ability to hold the central bank accountable for its\npolicy decisions.\n\nI have argued for some time that the FOMC should provide information about the\nfactors that will influence its policy decisions. Some call this a policy rule or reaction\nfunction. This will not only enhance transparency but also impose an important\ndiscipline on policymaking. If policymakers choose to deviate from the guidelines, they\nare forced to explain why and when they anticipate returning to more normal operating\n\n4\n\n\fpractices. Requiring this type of transparency raises the bar policymakers face to\nengage in discretionary policies in the first place.\n\nLet me now turn to the FOMC’s second, and perhaps more important, step toward\nclarity. In January, the Committee issued a statement of its long‐term goals and\nstrategy. The statement made four important points. First, the Committee reaffirmed\nits commitment to its mandated goals of maximum employment, price stability, and\nmoderate long‐term interest rates.\n\nSecond, the statement acknowledged what economists have known for over 200 years –\nthat in the intermediate to longer run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and is thus\ndetermined by monetary policy. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Fed to set an\nexplicit long‐run target for inflation. The target selected was 2 percent, as measured by\nthe year‐over‐year change in the personal consumption expenditures chain‐weighted\nprice index. By being explicit about its numerical objective for inflation, the Fed\nenhances the credibility of its commitment to price stability. This helps anchor inflation\nexpectations, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long‐term interest rates.\nAnother benefit of such an explicit objective is that it provides the public with a\nnumerical metric by which it can, and should, hold the Fed accountable.\n\nOf course, articulating an inflation target is now viewed as a best practice in central\nbanking and is a key step in achieving the benefits of transparency.\n\nThe third important feature of the statement explained why it is not appropriate for the\nFed to establish a numerical objective for the maximum employment part of its\nmandate. This is not because the employment part of the mandate is less important,\nbut because the economic determinants of employment are different from those of\ninflation. Maximum employment is largely determined by factors that are beyond the\ncontrol of monetary policy. These factors include such things as demographics,\n\n5\n\n\ftechnological innovations, and numerous government policies, including tax policy,\nminimum wage laws, unemployment benefits, and the like. All of these factors can and\ndo vary over time. Thus, the maximum level of employment will vary. It is also difficult\nto measure and not directly observable. Moreover, different economic models often\nlead to different conceptual views of how to define maximum employment. Therefore,\nit is inappropriate for the central bank to set a numerical objective for something it does\nnot control and cannot measure with any degree of certainty.\n\nFinally, the statement pointed out that the goals of monetary policy are complementary\nover the longer run. Price stability promotes economic efficiency by giving households\nand businesses more confidence that the purchasing power of the dollar will not erode.\nThis simplifies the decision‐making of economic agents, allowing the economy to\nfunction more efficiently and more productively. Conversely, the failure to maintain\nprice stability can often lead to greater instability in output and employment.\n\nHowever, in the short term, it is possible that the maximum employment and price\nstability parts of the Fed’s mandate could be in conflict. The statement makes clear that\nin such circumstances the Fed will pursue a balanced approach to promoting its\nobjectives. Admittedly, this statement does not give much guidance as to how policy\nwill be conducted, but I suggest that the public watch the assessments of the\nappropriate policy as viewed by policymakers in the SEP as an important source of\ninformation in this regard.\n\nSo the FOMC is taking important steps as it seeks to demystify monetary policy. Clarity\nand transparency are important for achieving our objectives, and I believe that the\nCommittee will continue on this journey as it seeks to improve the clarity and\neffectiveness of its communications.\n\n6\n\n\f"

        "content": "A Perspective on the Economic Outlook\n\nPresented to CFA Society of San Diego\nSan Diego, CA\nMay 1, 2012\n\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fA Perspective on the Economic Outlook\nCFA Society of San Diego\nMay 1, 2012\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me to speak to the CFA Society of San Diego today. I have\naddressed chartered financial analysts in Philadelphia on a number of occasions, and I\nam pleased that travels to California this week afforded me the opportunity to accept\nyour invitation to present my views on the economic outlook and monetary policy.\nLast week, I attended the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,\nor the FOMC, which is the body within the Federal Reserve responsible for determining\nmonetary policy. As many of you know, according to the Committee’s structure, there\nare 12 voting members on the FOMC — the seven members of the Board of Governors\nin Washington always have a vote; currently only five of the seven seats are filled. The\nother voters include five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents: the president of the New\nYork Fed, who is a permanent voting member, and four other presidents, who serve\none‐year terms on a rotating basis.\nThis year happens to be one in which my colleague John Williams, president of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is a voting member, as I was last year.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee's assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. Each of us prepares for the meetings by gathering\ninformation throughout our Districts, around the nation, and, in some cases,\ninternationally. The federated structure draws on the strong roots of decentralized\ngovernment that our country was founded on and ensures that our national monetary\n\n1\n\n\fpolicy has its roots not just in Washington or on Wall Street but also on Main Street and\nacross our diverse nation.\nSo conversations like the ones I’ve had with some of you today and with other\nindividuals from business and community organizations help me gather and share timely\ninformation on the economy. This leads to more informed decisions as the Committee\nseeks to achieve the goals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us in the Federal\nReserve Act. Specifically, Congress has mandated that the Fed should conduct policy to\n“promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate\nlong‐term interest rates.” Since moderate long‐term interest rates generally result\nwhen prices are stable and the economy is operating at full employment, it is often said\nthat Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\nI believe the diversity of opinion around the FOMC table is one of its great strengths and\nserves to improve the quality of our decision‐making. Yet, it requires me to note that I\nspeak for myself and not the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the Federal\nOpen Market Committee.\nEconomic Outlook\nNow let me turn to the state of our economy. We have now seen 11 consecutive\nquarters of expansion since mid‐2009, when the recession officially ended. In the third\nquarter of 2011 we finally surpassed the previous peak in real GDP, which occurred in\nthe fourth quarter of 2007. The expansion, as you read about every day and most likely\nexperience in your businesses, has not been particularly robust. To many, it occasionally\nfeels like we take two steps forward only to take one step back.\nWe finished 2011 with GDP growth of just 1.6 percent, compared to 3.1 percent in the\nprior year. Unexpected shocks early in the year, ranging from the disasters in Japan that\nled to supply chain disruptions in many industries, to flare‐ups in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa that led to a steep rise in oil prices, and the re‐emergence of the sovereign\ndebt crisis in Europe held GDP growth to less than 1 percent in the first half of the year.\n2\n\n\fYet, the economy persevered, even through our own debt‐ceiling crisis, and grew at an\nannual rate of 2.4 percent in the second half of the year. In fact, growth accelerated\nacross each of the four quarters, from less than half of a percent in the first quarter to 3\npercent in the fourth quarter.\nThe first estimate of first‐quarter GDP growth was reported last week as 2.2 percent.\nThis number was slightly less than many forecasters anticipated, but it was in line with\nmy forecast of moderate growth that will strengthen over time.\nI anticipate that we will see moderate year‐over‐year growth of about 3 percent in 2012\nand 2013. That outlook puts me in a slightly more optimistic camp than some\nforecasters. For example, my forecast is at the top of the central tendency of the FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts that were submitted last week. And the Philadelphia Fed’s first‐\nquarter Survey of Professional Forecasters reported average estimates of real GDP\ngrowing 2.3 percent in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013. Our second‐quarter survey won’t\nbe released until later this month; however, many private‐sector forecasters have\nmarked up their outlook slightly since the early part of the year based on the somewhat\nbetter than expected first‐quarter performance, particularly on the consumption and\nemployment fronts.\nGrowth in manufacturing has proven to be a bright spot for the economy over the last\nsix to nine months, and it continues to be a reason for optimism going forward. The\nPhiladelphia Fed’s monthly Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers has been a useful\nbarometer of national trends in manufacturing over many years. The survey’s general\nactivity index tracked with last year’s summer lull, posting a few negative readings\nduring the late spring and summer, but since then, the survey has reported seven\nmonths of positive numbers – indicating a moderate but steady expansion. Moreover,\nthe survey’s indicators of activity six months ahead have remained strong, suggesting\nthat manufacturers are optimistic about the future.\n\n3\n\n\fAnother upbeat indicator can be found in the Philadelphia Fed’s coincident indexes for\nall 50 states. We produce these indexes monthly to create a state‐by‐state view of the\neconomy. Our latest readings indicate growth in every state for the three months\nending in March. A similar set of leading indicators also shows that growth is expected\nto continue over the next six months in nearly all states, including here in California.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation’s GDP, also\ncontinues to improve, as the drag from household deleveraging lessens. Despite\nmodest wage growth, retail sales in March grew 0.8 percent from the previous month\nand 6.5 percent above March 2011. The Bureau of Economic Analysis also reported that\nfirst‐quarter personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased at a 2.9 percent annual\nrate in the first quarter – up from 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter and the most rapid\nrate of consumption growth since the last quarter of 2010.\nOn the housing front, I expect to see stabilization and maybe slight improvement in\n2012. Yet, as the old real estate saying goes: “Location, location, location!” Whereas\nsome regions saw a tremendous build‐up in residential real estate, followed by a sharp\ndecline, other areas, including many parts of my region back east, saw neither the\ndramatic boom nor the tragic bust. At a national level, though, we must acknowledge\nthat we entered the recession over‐invested in residential real estate, and we are not\nlikely to see a strong housing recovery until the surplus inventory of foreclosed and\ndistressed properties declines.\nYet we must realize that even as the economy rebalances, housing and related sectors\nare not likely to return to those heady pre‐recession highs, nor should we expect them\nto do so. Those highs were unsustainable, and the housing crash that ensued destroyed\na great deal of wealth for consumers and the economy as a whole. The losses are real\nand the consequences severe for many individuals and many businesses. Moreover,\nmonetary policy does not create real wealth so it cannot eliminate or offset these\nlosses, nor should it try to do so.\n\n4\n\n\fNevertheless, households and businesses continue to make progress on restoring the\nhealth of their balance sheets by paying down debt and increasing savings. This is a\nrational reaction and a healthy trend. Most economists, including me, believe that this\ntrend will continue into 2012.\nConditions in the labor markets continue to improve modestly, though monthly\nnumbers do bounce around a bit. For example, strong job growth from December\nthrough February may have partially reflected the effect of unseasonably mild weather\nthis winter, and the modest pullback in March may represent some payback. Indeed,\nMarch’s gain of 120,000 nonfarm jobs came after three months of solid growth of more\nthan 200,000 a month. I prefer to average the quarter’s monthly numbers to infer the\nunderlying trend. Doing so, we see that average monthly gains in the first quarter\noutpaced those in the fourth quarter by nearly 50,000 jobs per month.\nSo, we continue to make slow, steady progress, as evidenced by an unemployment rate\nthat fell to 8.2 percent in March, down almost a full percentage point from the 9.1\npercent in August. I expect further gradual declines in the unemployment rate, with the\nrate falling to about 7.8 percent by the end of this year.\nDespite this gradual improvement, we cannot ignore the fact that there are still too\nmany people unemployed. The U.S. lost 8.8 million jobs from the peak of employment\nin January 2008 to the trough in employment in February 2010. We have gained back\n3.5 million lost jobs, or 40 percent, but it will take some time before we, once again, see\na truly vibrant labor market.\nAny forecast is subject to some risks, and today I will discuss two risks on the horizon.\nThe first is the potential effects of the continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe, and\nthe second is a lesser risk from rising energy costs.\nOver the past year, U.S. financial markets have been roiled by worries about the\nEuropean sovereign debt situation. We have often seen good news on the U.S.\neconomy drowned out by the news from Europe. The crisis was a long time in the\n5\n\n\fmaking and continues despite the efforts of European leaders. Many who thought that\npreventing sovereign default by a euro country would prevent the crisis from spreading\nhave been proven wrong. A number of the peripheral countries in Europe are\nunquestionably on fiscal paths that are unsustainable and that must be addressed. I\nmight add that the U.S. is also on an unsustainable fiscal path that must be addressed.\nLet me stress that these are fiscal issues, not monetary issues. Thus, we should look to\nthe fiscal authorities for solutions, not our central banks. I have come to believe that\nthe European governments and their economies will muddle through this near‐term\ncrisis but at significant cost to the taxpayers all across the euro zone. Nevertheless, the\nturmoil has resulted in an economic slowdown in the euro zone that will likely cause a\nsmall drag on U.S. exports.\nThe other risk facing the U.S. economy has been the rising cost of oil and gasoline. Oil\nprices have fallen from their recent highs, but they remain over $100 a barrel and\ngasoline is about $4 a gallon. However, unless the price of oil rises substantially from\ncurrent levels, this is not likely to derail our recovery. I come to this assessment, in part,\nbecause the U.S. economy is less vulnerable to oil price shocks than it was in the 1970s\nand 1980s, in part because we use about half as much energy to make a dollar of real\nGDP than we used to in the 1970s.\nIn addition, while oil prices have risen, natural gas prices have been falling, and they are\nnow at their lowest level since 1999. This is a result of both increased production in\nplaces like Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale areas, as well as reduced demand because of\nthe mild winter. Thus, while energy is still an important factor of production, our\neconomy is less dependent on oil than it used to be.\nThe larger risk from higher energy prices is not to growth but to inflation and\nexpectations of inflation. The Fed recently set its long‐term inflation target at 2 percent,\nas measured by the year‐over‐year change in the personal consumption expenditures\nchain‐weighted price index. By that measure, prices rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate\nover the year ended in the first quarter, which is above our target. While this may prove\n6\n\n\fto be temporary as oil prices stabilize, there is a risk that the oil price increases we’ve\nseen so far this year will not reverse as anticipated, which could put additional pressure\non prices and inflation expectations. Thus, we must continue to monitor these inflation\ntrends with some care and be prepared to take appropriate action as necessary.\nThe public has the right to expect the central bank to keep inflation near its target of 2\npercent over the medium to longer term. Inflation often develops gradually, and if\nmonetary policy waits too long to respond, it can be very costly to correct. Measures of\nslack such as the unemployment rate are often thought to prevent inflation from rising.\nBut the lessons of the 1970s show that is not the case. As you may recall, we ended up\nwith both high unemployment and high inflation, and the sum of those two statistics\nbecame known as the misery index. More recently, I note that for nearly three years,\nthe Bank of England has been forecasting that inflation will return to its 2 percent\ntarget, but it has failed to do so, even though England’s economy has contracted over\nthe past two quarters and many perceive the level of slack in the British economy as\nlarge and increasing. That is not a place we want to find ourselves.\nMonetary Policy\nBefore discussing where monetary policy might go as economic conditions evolve in the\ncoming quarters, it might be helpful to review just how much accommodation we\ncurrently have in place. As you know, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero\nfor more than three years to support the recovery. We have also conducted two rounds\nof asset purchases that have more than tripled the size of our balance sheet. We\ncontinue to implement our maturity extension program, which is lengthening the\nmaturity of our holdings of Treasury securities and the composition of the portfolio has\nchanged from mainly short‐term Treasuries before the crisis to longer‐term Treasuries\nand housing‐related securities, mostly mortgage‐backed securities, today.\nMany of these actions were taken at the height of the financial crisis and the ensuing\ndeep recession. Yet, since then, as I have indicated, the economy has been healing, if\n7\n\n\fsomewhat more slowly than we would like, and the financial crisis has substantially\nabated. Of course, problems remain, but things are not nearly as bad or as gloomy as\nthey were in 2009 and early 2010. At its latest meeting in April, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee continued to hold to its statement that economic conditions were\n“likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late\n2014.” That follows a structure for forward guidance that the Committee first began\nlast August, when it said conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates\nthrough mid 2013. Then in January, it pushed back that calendar date another 18\nmonths to late 2014.\nThe FOMC has also announced that the Fed intends to complete the maturity extension\nprogram, or “operation twist,” first launched last September and set to end in June. In\nthis program, the Fed is buying $400 billion of longer‐term Treasuries and selling an\nequal amount of shorter‐term Treasuries, in an effort to reduce long‐term yields from\nalready historically low levels. The FOMC is also continuing to reinvest principal\npayments from its holdings of agency debt and MBS into MBS in an effort to help\nmortgage markets.\nYou may know that I dissented from the FOMC decisions in August and September\nbecause it was not clear to me that increasing monetary policy accommodation was\nappropriate then. After all, inflation was higher and unemployment was lower relative\nto the previous year, as we have been discussing. Since that time, unemployment has\ndecreased further, and inflation is above target. While I believe monetary\naccommodation is still called for, in the absence of some shock that derails the recovery,\nwe may well need to begin to gradually scale back the level of accommodation well\nbefore the end of 2014.\nAnother reason I dissented last year was that I did not favor providing forward guidance\nin terms of a calendar date. Monetary policy should be responsive to economic\nconditions, and I believe that we should be providing information on the economic\n\n8\n\n\ffactors that will influence our monetary policy decisions rather than trying to forecast\nwhen that time will be.\n\nIn January, the Committee took a step to enhance the information it includes in its\neconomic projections, which are summarized four times a year in the Survey of\nEconomic Projections, or SEP. I believe such information will prove to be useful in\nconveying the relationship between changes in economic conditions and monetary\npolicy decisions. In particular, the Committee now summarizes the monetary policy\nassessments that underlie the economic projections of output, inflation, and\nunemployment. These assessments are what the individual policymakers view as the\npolicy path that is appropriate in achieving the Fed’s longer‐term goals.\n\nThis additional information has two benefits. First, having more information on the\nunderlying paths should help the public better understand the projections. For\nexample, they will have a better understanding of whether inflation is expected to\nreturn to the long‐term goal as shocks work their way through the economy or whether\npolicymakers anticipate that further monetary policy actions will be needed to achieve\nthe Committee’s objective.\n\nSecond, as views of appropriate policy evolve over time as economic and financial\nconditions change, the public will be able to draw better inferences about the relation\nbetween current economic conditions, the economic outlook, and appropriate policy.\nThis then informs the public about how policy is likely to react in the future to changes\nin the economy. For example, in April, the SEP indicated that only four participants now\nexpect the first increase in the federal funds rate will occur after 2014, compared to six\nin the January projections. These projections of the policy path have changed as the\ncentral tendencies of the 2012 projections of growth and inflation were revised up and\nprojections of unemployment were revised down.\n\n9\n\n\fWe know that when monetary policy is conducted in a systematic way — that is, with a\nsystematic relationship between changes in economic conditions and the policy actions\ntaken by the central bank — policy becomes more transparent and easier to\ncommunicate. And the better the public and the markets understand how policy is\nlikely to be adjusted as the economy changes, the more predictable policy becomes,\nwhich promotes price stability and better economic outcomes. In addition, policy\ntransparency can increase the public’s ability to hold the central bank accountable for its\npolicy decisions.\n\nI believe, and have argued for some time, that the FOMC should strive to provide\ninformation about the factors that will influence our policy decisions. Some call this a\npolicy rule or reaction function. This will not only enhance transparency but also impose\nan important discipline on policymaking. If policymakers choose to deviate from the\nguidelines, they are forced to explain why and when they anticipate returning to more\nnormal operating practices. Requiring this type of transparency raises the bar\npolicymakers face to engage in discretionary policies in the first place.\n\nI suspect that the FOMC participants may not be quite ready to agree on a specific policy\nrule or reaction function because they use different models and have different loss\nfunctions. However, I do believe it will be possible to provide assessments of the\nevolution of the key variables influencing our policy choices and then communicate our\npolicy decisions in terms of the changes in these key variables. If policy was changed,\nthen we would explain that change in terms of how the variables in our response\nfunction changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically use\nthem to describe our policy choices, the public will form more accurate judgments\nabout the likely course of policy – reducing uncertainty and promoting stability.\n\n10\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, with job growth strengthening and\nthe unemployment rate falling gradually over time. I believe inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and inflation will remain at moderate levels in the near term.\nHowever, with the very accommodative stance of monetary policy that has now been in\nplace for more than three years, we must guard against the medium‐ and longer‐term\nrisks of inflation and further distortions such accommodation can create.\nMonetary policy should be determined by economic conditions and not by a calendar\ndate. I believe the FOMC should continue to work toward increasing the public’s\nunderstanding of how policy will systematically react to changes in economic conditions.\nImproving the transparency of our monetary policy decision‐making process will help to\nimprove the effectiveness of monetary policy and the Fed’s accountability with the\npublic.\n\n11\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fTransparent Communications:\nThe Journey Continues\nNational Economists Club\nWashington, D.C.\nApril 12, 2012\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nIt is a pleasure to be here today. I am particularly pleased to join the list of\ndistinguished speakers who have appeared before you over the years. Today, I would\nlike to discuss the Federal Reserve’s journey to improve the clarity and transparency of\nits communications. Of course, it may seem obvious that all communications should be\ntransparent – otherwise, you really aren’t communicating. However, it has taken\ncentral banks some time to appreciate the benefits of clear and transparent\ncommunications about monetary policymaking. Some observers think that monetary\npolicy should remain a bit mysterious. They believe that efforts to communicate “too\nmuch” can backfire or result in confusion. Yet, this is most likely to be the case when\ncommunications lack clarity. Others seem to equate clear communications with\nproviding a degree of omniscience about the future – omniscience that, of course,\ndoesn’t really exist.\nYet, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have made important progress\nrecently. Therefore, it seems like an opportune time to remind ourselves of the benefits\nof transparency in central banking. I will review some of the steps that the FOMC took\nin January toward increased transparency. Then I will suggest some additional\n\n1\n\n\finitiatives I believe would be beneficial. Of course, these are my views and not\nnecessarily those of the Federal Reserve System or my colleagues on the FOMC.\nBenefits of Transparency\nOver the last 30 years, economists have come to understand that expectations play an\nimportant role in the economy. Whether we think about labor markets, product\nmarkets, or financial markets, expectations affect the decisions made by households,\nbusinesses, and investors. Economic actors form expectations about a wide variety of\nthings that affect their decisions, including tax policies, inflation, monetary policy, real\neconomic growth, as well as other factors that may affect the supply and demand\nconditions that might prevail in various financial and product markets.\nMonetary policy can influence expectations and thus economic choices through a\ncouple of important inter-related channels. First, monetary policy can affect the\nexpected path of inflation. Uncertainty about this anticipated path can wreak havoc on\nfinancial plans and cause businesses and households to expend valuable resources to\ninsulate their plans from unexpected and volatile movements in inflation. Thus,\nincreased transparency about the central bank’s goals and objectives regarding inflation\ncan improve economic efficiency and help anchor expectations of inflation.\nSecond, long-term interest rates are important for many economic decisions and\nmonetary policy can affect long-term interest rates through the expected path of a\nshort-term rate, which is the standard instrument of monetary policy. Consequently, a\nbetter understanding of how policymakers will react to economic events over time can\nreduce uncertainty about the expected path of the short-term interest rate and so\nreduce the uncertainty and volatility of long-term rates.\nReducing uncertainty about monetary policy, therefore, can help anchor expectations,\nimprove the effectiveness of monetary policy, and reduce economic volatility. It also\n\n2\n\n\fimproves economic efficiency by allowing households and businesses to make more\ninformed decisions. Given these benefits, central banks have sought to improve\ntransparency about the goals and objectives of monetary policy and how monetary\ndecisions are made.\nTransparency has other benefits as well. For example, transparency enhances the\ncentral bank’s accountability and independence. Central bank independence is a\nfundamental tenet of sound central banking and leads to better economic outcomes.\nBut independence must be accompanied by accountability. And accountability is more\neasily achieved when there is transparency. The public can best hold a central bank\naccountable when its goals are clearly stated and feasible. Assigning the central bank\nresponsibility for things it cannot achieve or expecting the central bank to achieve a set\nof objectives that is too expansive makes it nearly impossible for the public to hold the\ncentral bank accountable. As the old expression goes, responsible for everything and\naccountable for nothing. Transparent and clear communications of monetary policy\ngoals and a decision-making framework help ensure accountability and preserve central\nbank independence.\nTransparency can also enhance a central bank’s credibility. A central bank that is\ntransparent will be less willing to make promises it cannot keep. When policy\npronouncements are more credible, policy is more effective. Transparency can also\nmake it easier to explain changes in policy without damaging the central bank’s\ncredibility.\nWe’ve Come a Long Way\nThe Fed has been on a journey toward greater transparency for some time. But the\npace of change has clearly accelerated under Chairman Bernanke. It may seem hard to\nbelieve, but it was not until 1994 that the FOMC began to publicly announce the policy\n\n3\n\n\fdecisions made at the FOMC meetings. Up to then, the markets were left to infer the\npolicy action from the Fed’s behavior in the market.\nPrior to the 1990s, policymakers were concerned that giving the public more\ninformation about the rationale for policy decisions or even releasing the statement and\ndirective given to the Open Market Trading Desk would lock policymakers into certain\nactions even if economic conditions changed. There was a strong desire to maintain\nflexibility. 1 Indeed, many of the arguments against transparency focused on the idea\nthat it reduced the Committee’s discretion in setting policy. Yet, we now know that\ndiscretion is generally not optimal. Economic research in the past 30 years has shown\nthat setting monetary policy in a systematic or rule-like manner leads to better\neconomic outcomes – lower and less volatile inflation and greater economic stability in\ngeneral.2 Such systematic policies are more predictable and thus allow for better\ndecision-making by consumers and businesses.\nSince 1994, when the Fed began to announce changes in the federal funds rate target, it\nhas taken a number of steps to improve the public’s understanding of policy decisions,\nincluding the most recent initiatives announced in January of this year.\nIn 2000, the Fed began to release a statement after each meeting regardless of whether\na policy action was taken. The statement included a description of the state of the\neconomy and the rationale for the policy decision. It also offered an assessment of the\nrisks to the economic outlook.\nTwo years later, in 2002, the Fed began to release the votes of the individual members\nand the policy preferences of any dissenters in the post-meeting statement.\n1\n\nSee Alan S. Binder, “Making Monetary Policy and Talking about It,” U.S. Monetary Policy Forum,\nWashington, D.C., March 9, 2007.\n2\nSee Finn E. Kydland and Edward C. Prescott. “Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal\nPlans,” Journal of Political Economy, 85 (January 1977), pp. 473-91.\n\n4\n\n\fIn 2004, the Fed decided to speed up the release of the FOMC minutes after a threeweek lag.\nAfter the appointment of Chairman Bernanke in 2006, the FOMC increased its efforts to\ncommunicate more clearly with the public. In 2007, the Fed started to produce\nquarterly economic projections of FOMC participants and expanded information\nregarding the heterogeneity of views.\nIn 2009, the Fed expanded the projections to include participants’ assessments of the\nlong-run tendencies of key economic variables.\nThen in 2011, the Chairman initiated a quarterly press conference coinciding with the\nrelease of the economic projections.\nMost recently, in January 2012, the Fed took two more steps on its march toward\nenhanced transparency. First, it issued a statement about monetary policy’s long-run\ngoals and strategy, including an explicit target for inflation. It also began including\ninformation on the policy path assumptions underlying the FOMC participants’\neconomic projections.\nI will describe these two steps in greater detail, but I want to emphasize that this trend\ntoward more central bank transparency has not been confined to the Fed. Different\ncentral banks have taken different approaches, in part, reflecting their diverse\ninstitutional structures. The now widely adopted practice of inflation targeting is only\nthe first step. While inflation targeting establishes a clear goal, it lacks precise policy\nprescriptions for how to achieve that goal. In order to have policy decisions wellunderstood by the public, central banks with explicit inflation targets augment their\n\n5\n\n\fcommunications with inflation reports, press conferences, and speeches so that the\npublic will better understand how policy will be conducted.\nRecent Steps to Enhance Transparency\nLet me now turn to the FOMC’s most recent initiatives to improve the clarity and\ntransparency of our policy framework, beginning with the consensus statement of its\nlong-term goals and strategy released in January. The statement made four important\npoints. First, the Committee reaffirmed its commitment to its mandated goals of\nmaximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates.\nSecond, the statement acknowledged what economists have known for over 200 years –\nthat in the intermediate to longer run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and thus\ndetermined by monetary policy. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Fed to set an\nexplicit long-run target for inflation. The target selected was 2 percent, as measured by\nthe year-over-year change in the personal consumption expenditures chain-weighted\nprice index. By being explicit about its numerical objective for price stability, the Fed\nenhances the credibility of its commitment to price stability. This helps anchor inflation\nexpectations, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates.\nAnother benefit of such an explicit objective is that it provides the public with a\nnumerical metric by which it can, and should, hold the Fed accountable.\nOf course, articulating an inflation target is now a very common feature of what is\nviewed as best practice in central banking and is a key step in achieving the benefits of\ntransparency.\nThe third important feature of the statement explained why it is not appropriate for the\nFed to establish a numerical objective for the maximum employment part of its\nmandate. This is not because the employment part of the mandate is less important,\nbut because the economic determinants of employment are different from those of\n\n6\n\n\finflation. Maximum employment is largely determined by factors that are beyond the\ncontrol of monetary policy. These factors include such things as demographics,\ntechnological innovations, and numerous government policies, including tax policy,\nminimum wage laws, unemployment benefits, and the like. All of these factors can and\ndo vary over time. Thus, the maximum level of employment will vary. It is also difficult\nto measure and not directly observable. Moreover, different economic models often\nlead to different conceptual views of how to define maximum employment. Therefore,\nit is inappropriate for the central bank to set a numerical objective for something it does\nnot control and cannot measure with any degree of certainty.\nFinally, the statement pointed out that the goals of monetary policy are complementary\nover the longer run. Price stability promotes economic efficiency by giving households\nand businesses more confidence that the purchasing power of the dollar will not erode.\nThis simplifies the decision-making of economic agents, allowing the economy to\nfunction more efficiently and more productively. Conversely, the failure to maintain\nprice stability can often lead to greater instability in output and employment.\nHowever, in the short term, it is possible that the maximum employment and price\nstability parts of the Fed’s mandate could be in conflict. The statement makes clear that\nin such circumstances the Fed will pursue a balanced approach to promoting its\nobjectives. Admittedly, this statement does not give much guidance as to how policy\nwill be conducted, but I will have more to say on that in a few minutes.\nThe second new communications initiative launched in January involved the Survey of\nEconomic Projections, or SEP. As I mentioned earlier, these projections are reported\nfour times a year and provide information about the range of individual policymakers’\nassessments for key economic variables, including output, inflation, and unemployment.\nEach FOMC participant’s assessment is conditional on the policymakers’ assessment of\n“appropriate policy,” that is, the policy path most consistent with achieving the Fed’s\n\n7\n\n\flonger-term goals. Starting in January, the FOMC began releasing information on these\nassumed policy paths.\nThis additional information has two benefits. First, having more information on the\nunderlying policy paths should help the public better understand the projections. For\nexample, they will have a better understanding of whether inflation is expected to\nreturn to the long-term goal as shocks work their way through the economy or whether\npolicymakers anticipate that further monetary policy actions will be needed to achieve\nthe Committee’s objective.\nSecond, as views of appropriate policy evolve over time as economic and financial\nconditions change, the public will be able to draw better inferences about the\nrelationship among current economic conditions, the economic outlook, and\nappropriate policy. Thus, over time, the public will gain a better understanding of how\npolicy is likely to react in the future to changes in the economy.\nFurther Steps\nThe steps taken in January are important steps forward for the FOMC, but more can and\nshould be done. As I noted in my discussion of the Committee’s longer-terms goals and\nobjectives, the Committee’s description of how policy will be conducted is not entirely\nclear. Yet, we know that when monetary policy is conducted in a systematic way, it is\nmore transparent and easier to communicate.\nBy systematic policy, I mean policy that functions in a rule-like way. That is, there is a\nsystematic relationship between changes in economic conditions and the policy actions\nand choices made by the central bank. I have already discussed some of the benefits of\ntransparency, and a systematic approach to policymaking is a way of achieving greater\ntransparency. The better the public and the markets understand how policy is likely to\n\n8\n\n\fbe adjusted as the economy changes, the more predictable policy becomes, which\npromotes price stability and better economic outcomes.\nOf course, policymakers do not know with certainty how economic conditions will\nevolve. So they cannot and should not say with any certainty what policy will be in the\nfuture. But policymakers can provide information about the factors that will influence\ntheir policy decisions. Some call this a policy rule or reaction function.\nI believe that the Fed should provide more information about its reaction function and\ncommunicate its policy choices in terms of that reaction function. It is not just about\ntransparency. The practice of using systematic rules as guides to monetary policy\nimposes an important discipline on policymaking as well as improving communications\nand transparency. For example, at times it may be important for policymakers to\ndeviate from the guidelines. But then policymakers will be forced to explain why they\ndeviated and when they anticipate returning to more normal operating practices.\nRequiring this type of transparency raises the bar that policymakers face to engage in\ndiscretionary policies in the first place.\nI suspect that the FOMC participants are not ready to agree on a specific policy rule or\nreaction function because they use different models and have different loss functions.\nHowever, there is reason to be optimistic since there is a growing literature on robust\nrules that work well in a range of models and reasonable loss functions. In the\nmeantime, it does seem feasible that participants could agree on a set of economic\nvariables to which monetary policy should react. The academic literature suggests using\nrules that respond aggressively to deviations of inflation from the central bank’s target\nand less aggressively to deviations of output from some concept of “potential output”\nor some alternative measure of resource utilization. 3 We would not have to specify the\n3\n\nSee Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams, \"Robust Monetary Policy Rules with Unknown Natural\nRates,\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (2002), pp. 63-118.\n\n9\n\n\fprecise mathematical rule but would provide assessments of key variables and then\ncommunicate our policy decisions in terms of changes in these key variables. If policy\nwere changed, then we would explain that change in terms of how the variables in our\nresponse function changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically\nuse them to describe our policy choices, the public will form more accurate judgments\nabout the likely course of policy – thereby reducing uncertainty and promoting stability.\nFinally, I think that the FOMC could improve communication and transparency by\npreparing a more comprehensive monetary policy report on a regular basis, perhaps\nquarterly. Currently, the Chairman testifies before Congress twice a year and submits\nan accompanying written report. In addition, the Chairman holds press briefings four\ntimes a year to summarize the SEP. I think there is an opportunity to combine these\nefforts into a more comprehensive report on monetary policy as many other countries\ndo. The report would offer an opportunity to reinforce the underlying policy framework\nand how it relates to economic conditions in addition to summarizing the SEP.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, the FOMC is on a journey to improve the transparency of its monetary\npolicy decision-making process. The benefits of transparency are now accepted by\npolicymakers across the globe. Transparency not only improves the effectiveness of\nmonetary policy, it also improves the central bank’s credibility and accountability with\nthe public. The FOMC’s recent moves to publish guidelines on its longer-run goals and\npolicy strategy and the policy assumptions that underlie FOMC projections are great\nstrides toward this goal. However, transparency is a journey, and not a destination, and\nmore can be done. In particular, I believe the FOMC should continue to work toward\nincreasing the public’s understanding of how policy will react systematically to changes\nin economic conditions.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak to the Rotary Club of Wilmington. In planning for\ntoday, I learned that Wilmington’s business and community leaders have been gathering\nunder your auspices at this location since 1914, longer than any other Rotary Club in the\nworld. From one organization that is almost a century old to another, that is quite an\nachievement.\nSince the Federal Reserve is nearing its centennial in December 2013, I thought I would\ngive you a little background on our nation’s central bank before I talk about my\neconomic outlook. While many Americans hear about the Fed in the news every day,\nnot everyone knows how we work or how we are structured.\nCongress created the Federal Reserve System in 1913. To balance political, economic,\nand geographic interests, the System was designed with 12 independently chartered\nregional Reserve Banks throughout the country, overseen by a Board of Governors in\nWashington, D.C. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia serves the Third District,\nwhich includes Delaware, the southern half of New Jersey, and the eastern two‐thirds of\nPennsylvania. The Reserve Banks distribute currency, act as a banker’s bank, and\n\n1\n\n\fgenerally perform the functions of a central bank, including serving as the federal\ngovernment’s fiscal agent.\nA central bank also guides the country’s monetary policy. In the U.S., the body within\nthe Federal Reserve that makes monetary policy decisions is the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, or the FOMC. The Committee includes the seven members of the Board of\nGovernors in Washington – there are currently two open posts – and five of the 12\nReserve Bank presidents: the president of the New York Fed and four other presidents,\nwho serve one‐year terms on a rotating basis. This structure ensures that our national\nmonetary policy has its roots not just in Washington or on Wall Street, but also on Main\nStreet and across our diverse nation.\nWhether we vote or not, all Reserve Bank presidents attend the FOMC meetings,\nparticipate in the discussions, and contribute to the Committee's assessment of the\neconomy and policy options. Each of us prepares for the meetings by gathering\ninformation throughout our Districts, around the nation, and, in some cases,\ninternationally. This occurs through meetings with our boards of directors and advisory\ncouncils, conversations with local and international business leaders, as well as briefings\non economic conditions by our Research staffs. All this helps contribute to a rich and\ncomprehensive mosaic of the national economy.\nIn this way, we are able to make the best informed decisions possible to achieve the\ngoals of monetary policy that Congress has set for us in the Federal Reserve Act.\nSpecifically, Congress mandates that the Fed should conduct policy to “promote\neffectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long‐term\ninterest rates.” Since moderate long‐term interest rates generally result when prices\nare stable, it is often said that Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate.\nI believe the diversity of opinion around the FOMC table is one of its great strengths and\nserves to improve the quality of our decision‐making. As the famous American\n\n2\n\n\fjournalist Walter Lippmann once said, “Where all men think alike, no one thinks very\nmuch.” But that diversity of views also requires me to note that I speak for myself and\nnot the Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nEconomic Outlook\nNow let me turn to the state of our economy. We have now seen 10 quarters of real\nGDP growth since mid 2009, when the Great Recession officially ended. However,\ngrowth has not been particularly robust or smooth. To many, it occasionally feels like\nwe take two steps forward only to take one step back. We finished 2011 with real GDP\nat 1.6 percent, compared to 3.1 percent in the prior year. There were some perfectly\nunderstandable reasons for the weakness last year, given the unexpected shocks we\nexperienced early in the year. Yet, the economy persevered. We saw growth accelerate\nacross each of the four quarters, from less than half of a percent in the first quarter to 3\npercent in the fourth quarter.\nI anticipate that we will continue to see moderate growth of around 3 percent in 2012\nand 2013. That outlook puts me in a slightly more optimistic camp than some\nforecasters. For instance, the Philadelphia Fed’s first‐quarter Survey of Professional\nForecasters reported average estimates of real GDP growing 2.3 percent in 2012 and 2.7\npercent in 2013.\nBusiness spending, especially investment in equipment and software, remained\nrelatively healthy last year, buoyed by solid growth in corporate earnings.\nResults from the Philadelphia Fed’s monthly Business Outlook Survey of manufacturers,\nwhich are widely viewed as a useful barometer of national trends in manufacturing,\nhave continued to improve since last summer’s lull. In March, regional manufacturers\nreported that their current activity continued to expand at a moderate pace, the sixth\nconsecutive month of positive numbers. The survey’s indicators of general activity, new\norders, shipments, and employment all remained positive. The survey’s measures of\n3\n\n\ffuture activity showed that our respondents expect activity to continue to pick up over\nthe next six months.\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the nation’s GDP, also\ncontinues to improve. While personal consumer expenditures were steady through\nJanuary, retail sales in February grew 1.1 percent. While not exactly robust growth,\nretail sales are more than 6 percent higher than a year ago.\nOn the housing front, I expect to see stabilization and maybe some slight improvement\nin 2012. We entered the Great Recession over‐invested in residential real estate, and\nwe are not likely to see a strong housing recovery until the surplus inventory of\nforeclosed and distressed properties declines.\nEven as the economy rebalances, housing and related sectors are not likely to return to\nthose pre‐recession highs, nor should we expect them to do so. Those highs were\nunsustainable, and the housing crash that ensued destroyed a great deal of wealth for\nconsumers and the economy as a whole. The losses are real and the consequences\nsevere for many individuals and many businesses. Moreover, monetary policy cannot\npaper over these losses, nor should it try to do so.\nNevertheless, households and businesses continue to make progress on restoring the\nhealth of their balance sheets by paying down debt and increasing savings. That is a\nhealthy trend, and most economists, including me, believe that this trend will continue\ninto 2012.\nOn the labor front, I continue to be encouraged by recent employment reports,\nalthough everyone would agree that there are still too many people unemployed in our\nregion and in the nation. The February employment report showed a net gain of\n227,000 jobs, giving us the third month in a row with job growth of more than 200,000.\nWe also continued to see a trend of upward revisions in prior months, adding another\n60,000 jobs to payrolls.\n\n4\n\n\fThe unemployment rate was 8.3 percent in February, as it was in January, but the\nunemployment rate has been moving down steadily for six months, and it is now at its\nlowest levels in three years. As growth continues and strengthens, I expect further\ngradual declines in the unemployment rate, with the rate falling below 8 percent by the\nend of 2012.\nAt the regional level, the latest unemployment rates for January also showed\nimprovement. New Jersey’s rate, at about 9 percent, was still higher than the national\naverage, but Delaware’s rate of 7.0 percent and Pennsylvania’s rate of 7.6 percent were\nbelow the national average. Our Research Department is forecasting no change in the\nunemployment rates for Pennsylvania and New Jersey and a decline in Delaware’s\nunemployment rate in February. The data are scheduled for release tomorrow.\nWe are also seeing continued improvement in the employment index in our monthly\nsurvey of manufacturers, which suggests more employers are adding to payrolls than\ncutting back.\nAs we continue down the road to recovery, there will undoubtedly be some bumps and\nsetbacks along the way, but I am generally optimistic. Of course, any forecast is subject\nto some risks. The most significant and identifiable risk on the horizon is the potential\neffects of the continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In recent months, I have come\nto believe that the European governments and their economies will work through their\nchallenges. Nonetheless, the economic slowdown in the euro zone will likely exert a\nsmall drag on U.S. exports. And while European financial institutions have so far\nendured through the financial market turmoil in Europe, we must continue to monitor\nevents to ensure that these troubles do not spill over to U.S. financial institutions. Of\ncourse, regardless of how the European situation plays out, it has already imposed\nconsiderable uncertainty on growth prospects for the global economy. Hopefully, some\nof that uncertainty is beginning to wane. Moreover, our own nation’s fiscal challenges\ncontribute additional uncertainty to the economic landscape.\n\n5\n\n\fUntil the economic environment becomes clearer, firms and consumers are likely to\nexercise some restraint in their spending and hiring decisions, thus limiting the pace of\nrecovery, even while economic fundamentals in the U.S. continue to improve.\nOn the inflation front, there are risks and we must monitor the trends with care. The\nrate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.9 percent for the 12\nmonths through February. Another common measure called the personal consumption\nexpenditures price index was 2.4 percent through January. Thus, inflation is higher than\nthe Fed’s long‐term target of 2 percent. Some of the increased inflation over the past\nyear was driven by sharp increases in energy prices. During the late summer, oil prices\ndid decline somewhat, slowing price increases, but unfortunately, they have been rising\nagain and crude oil prices are now over $100 a barrel and gasoline prices are rising.\nOil prices have added a great deal of volatility to the overall price index. At times, sharp\nspikes in oil prices raise overall inflation, which is then reversed when those prices\nincreases moderate. Yet, since early 2009, when oil prices fell to about $60 a barrel, the\ntrend has been upward. Moreover, inflation rates that remove the effects of energy\nand food have been drifting upward as well from their lows of 1 percent or less in late\n2010 to about 2 percent or a little higher today, depending on the particular index.\nThus, we must monitor these inflation trends with some care and be prepared to take\nappropriate actions as necessary.\nThe public has the right to expect the central bank to keep inflation near its target of 2\npercent over the medium to longer term. Inflation often develops gradually, and if\nmonetary policy waits too long to respond, it can be very costly to correct. Measures of\nslack such as the unemployment rate are often thought to prevent inflation from rising.\nBut the lessons of the 1970s show that is not the case. As you may recall, we ended up\nwith both high unemployment and high inflation, which became known as the misery\nindex. That is not a place we want to find ourselves again.\n\n6\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nBefore discussing where monetary policy might go in relation to economic conditions, it\nmight be helpful to review just how much accommodation we currently have in place.\nAs you know, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero for more than three\nyears to support the recovery. We have also conducted two rounds of asset purchases\nthat have more than tripled the size of the Fed’s balance sheet and changed its\ncomposition from short‐term Treasuries to longer‐term Treasuries and housing‐related\nsecurities, mostly mortgage‐backed securities.\nMany of these actions were taken at the height of the financial crisis and the ensuing\ndeep recession. Yet, since then, as I have indicated, the economy has been healing, if\nsomewhat more slowly than we would like, and the financial crisis has substantially\nabated. Of course, problems remain, but things are not nearly as bad or as gloomy as\nthey were in 2009 and early 2010. At its latest meeting in March, the Federal Open\nMarket Committee continued to hold to its statement that economic conditions were\n“likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late\n2014.” That follows a structure for forward guidance that the Committee first began\nlast August, when it said conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low rates\nthrough mid 2013. Then in January, it pushed back that calendar date another 18\nmonths.\nThe FOMC has also announced that the Fed intends to continue the maturity extension\nprogram, or “operation twist,” first launched last September and set to end in June. In\nthis program, the Fed is buying $400 billion of longer‐term Treasuries and selling an\nequal amount of shorter‐term Treasuries, in an effort to reduce long‐term yields from\nalready historically low levels. The FOMC is also continuing to reinvest principal\npayments from its holdings of agency debt and MBS into MBS in an effort to help\nmortgage markets.\n\n7\n\n\fYou may know that I dissented from the FOMC decisions in August and September,\nbecause it was not clear to me that further monetary policy accommodation was\nappropriate then. After all, inflation was higher and unemployment was lower relative\nto the previous year, as we have been discussing. Monetary policy should be responsive\nto economic conditions, and since that time, unemployment has decreased, and\ninflation is above target. I believe monetary accommodation is still called for, but I do\nnot believe it should be as accommodative or aggressive as it was at the height of the\ncrisis, when unemployment was over 10 percent and inflation was just 1 percent. Now\nthat unemployment is at 8.3 percent and falling and inflation is over 2 percent and\ndrifting up, we should not anticipate additional accommodation. Indeed, in the absence\nof some shock that derails the recovery, we may well need to raise rates before the end\nof 2014.\nNevertheless, monetary policy should be responsive to economic conditions. In my\nview, current conditions do not warrant further accommodation. Yet, should economic\nconditions significantly deteriorate or the upside risks to inflation I have stressed fall and\nsignificant risk of deflation emerge, we should rethink our policy stance. But neither of\nthese events seems likely to me at this juncture.\nI believe further accommodation at this stage of the business cycle could lead us down a\nvery treacherous path – one that would be ever more difficult for us to navigate and one\nthat would increase the already substantial risk of higher inflation. Yet, the problem is\nnot just inflation risk down the road. Prolonged efforts to hold interest rates near zero\ncan lead to financial market distortions and the misallocation of resources that could\nlead to more, not less, economic instability.\n\n8\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, with job growth strengthening and\nthe unemployment rate falling gradually over time. I believe inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and inflation will remain at moderate levels in the near term.\nHowever, with the very accommodative stance of monetary policy that has now been in\nplace for more than three years, we must guard against the medium‐ and longer‐term\nrisks of inflation and further distortions such accommodation can create.\nMonetary policy should be determined by economic conditions and not by a calendar\ndate. And we should resist any notion that we can solve all of our economic challenges\nsimply by an ever more accommodative monetary policy.\n\n9\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nI am delighted to be here today in this beautiful city and to have the honor to serve on such a\ndistinguished panel with friends and colleagues. David Kotok has been the guiding force behind the GIC\nconferences over the past several years. He and his team at the GIC never fail to gather an interesting\nand knowledgeable group of people to discuss important topics on truly global issues. So, I want to\nthank him and the GIC for their efforts and contributions. I also want to thank our hosts, Christian Noyer\nand the Banque de France.\nI am going to take a little different tack on the subject matter of this gathering. Rather than focus on\nwhat new orthodoxy we should take away from the financial crisis, I want to argue that we need to\nrestore some of the old orthodoxy. David did suggest that he wanted to have a conversation on\nimportant issues, so I intend to be somewhat provocative in an effort to stimulate such conversation. As\nusual, I want to stress that my views are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the\nFederal Reserve System.\nI will focus my remarks on two related topics that have emerged as a consequence of the crisis. The first\nis the relation between monetary policy and fiscal policy. The second topic involves the role of a central\nbank’s balance sheet as a policy tool. These are issues that I believe are of fundamental importance to\nthe role of central banks in our economies.\nThe Relationship Between Monetary and Fiscal Policies\nLet me begin by sharing some thoughts on the appropriate relationship between monetary and fiscal\npolicies. In the wake of the financial crisis and the ensuing recession, many countries around the world\nresponded with a significant increase in government spending. Some of this increase came about\nthrough what economists call automatic stabilizers. But there has also been a dramatic expansion in\nbudget deficits attributable to deliberate efforts to apply fiscal stimulus to improve economic outcomes.\nThis expansion in government spending has been very significant in the U.S., but it has also occurred in\nother countries. So what does this have to do with monetary policy? Well, it turns out, a great deal. It\nis widely understood that governments can finance expenditures through taxation, debt — that is,\n1\n\n\ffuture taxes — or printing money. In this sense, monetary policy and fiscal policy are intertwined\nthrough the government budget constraint.\nFor good reasons, though, societies have converged toward arrangements that provide a fair degree of\nseparation between the functions of central banks and those of their fiscal authorities. For example, in\na world of fiat currency, central banks are generally assigned the responsibility for establishing and\nmaintaining the value or purchasing power of the nation’s unit of account. Yet, that task can be\nundermined, or completely subverted, if fiscal authorities set their budgets in a manner that ultimately\nrequires the central bank to finance government expenditures with significant amounts of seigniorage in\nlieu of current or future tax revenue. ∗\nThe ability of a central bank to maintain price stability can also be undermined when the central bank\nitself ventures into the realm of fiscal policy. History teaches us that unless governments are\nconstrained institutionally or constitutionally, they often resort to the printing press to try to escape\nwhat appear to be intractable budget problems. And the budget problems faced by many governments\ntoday are, indeed, challenging. But history also teaches us that resorting to the printing press in lieu of\nmaking tough fiscal choices is a recipe for creating substantial inflation and, in some cases,\nhyperinflation.\nAwareness of these long-term consequences of excessive money creation is the reason that over the\npast 60 years, country after country has moved to establish and maintain independent central banks —\nthat is, central banks that have the ability to make monetary policy decisions free from short-run\npolitical interference. Without the protections afforded by independence, the temptation of\ngovernments to exploit the printing press to avoid fiscal discipline is often just too great. Thus, it is\nsimply good governance and wise economic policy to maintain a healthy separation between those\nresponsible for tax and spending policy and those responsible for money creation.\nIt is equally important for central banks that have been granted independence to be constrained from\nusing their own authority to engage in activities that more appropriately belong to the fiscal authorities\nor the private sector. In other words, with independence comes responsibility and accountability.\nCentral banks that breach their boundaries risk their legitimacy, credibility, and ultimately, their\nindependence. Given the benefits of central bank independence, that could prove costly to society in\nthe long run.\nThere are a number of approaches to placing limits on independent central banks so that the boundaries\nbetween monetary policy and fiscal policy remain clear.\nFirst, the central bank can be given a narrow mandate, such as price stability. In fact, this has been a\nprominent trend during the last 25 years. Many major central banks now have price stability as their\nsole or primary mandate.\nSecond, the central bank can be restricted as to the type of assets it can hold on its balance sheet. This\nlimits its ability to engage in credit policies or resource allocations that rightfully belong under the\npurview of the fiscal authorities or the private marketplace.\n\n∗\n\nSee Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace, “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis Quarterly Review, 5 (Fall 1981), pp 1-17.\n\n2\n\n\fAnd third, the central bank can conduct monetary policy in a systematic or rule-like manner, which limits\nthe scope of discretionary actions that might cross the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies.\nMilton Friedman’s famous k-percent money growth rule is one example, as are Taylor-type rules for the\nsetting of the interest rate instrument.\nUnfortunately, over the past few years, the combination of a financial crisis and sustained fiscal\nimbalances has led to a breakdown in the institutional framework and the previously accepted barriers\nbetween monetary and fiscal policies. The pressure has come from both sides. Governments are\npushing central banks to exceed their monetary boundaries, and central banks are stepping into areas\nnot previously viewed as appropriate for an independent central bank.\nLet me offer a couple of examples to illustrate these pressures. First, despite the well-known benefits of\nprice stability, there are calls in many countries to abandon this commitment and create higher inflation\nto devalue outstanding nominal government and private debt. That is, some suggest that we should\nattempt to use inflation to solve the debt overhang problem. Such policies are intended to redistribute\nlosses on nominal debt from the borrowers to the lenders. Using inflation as a backdoor to such fiscal\nchoices is bad policy, in my view.\nPressure on central banks is also showing up through other channels. In some circles, it has become\nfashionable to invoke lender-of-last-resort arguments as a rationale for central banks to lend to\n“insolvent” organizations, either failing businesses or, in some cases, failing governments. Such\narguments go beyond the well-accepted principles established by Walter Bagehot, who wrote in his\n1873 classic Lombard Street that central bankers could limit systemic risk in a banking crisis by “lending\nfreely at a penalty rate against good collateral.” Central bankers have abandoned this basic Bagehot\nprinciple in the last few years but have not replaced it with a clear alternative. Indeed, actions were\noften confusing and unpredictable and lacked a coherent framework. I believe that central banks need\nto think hard about how and when they exercise this important role. We need to have a well-articulated\nand systematic approach to such actions. Otherwise, our actions will exacerbate moral hazard and\nencourage excessive risk-taking, thus sowing the seeds for the next crisis. Unfortunately, neither\nfinancial reform nor central banks have adequately addressed this dilemma.\nBreaching the boundaries is not confined to the fiscal authorities asking central banks to do their heavy\nlifting. The Fed and other central banks have undertaken other actions that have blurred the distinction\nbetween monetary policy and fiscal policy, such as adopting credit policies that favor some industries or\nasset classes relative to others. Such steps were taken with the sincere belief that they were absolutely\nnecessary to address the challenges posed by the financial crisis.\nThe clearest examples can be seen when the Federal Reserve established credit facilities to support\nmarkets for commercial paper and asset-backed securities. Most notable has been the effort by the Fed\nto support the housing market through its purchases of mortgage-backed securities. These credit\nallocations have not only breached the traditional boundaries between fiscal and monetary policy, they\nhave generated pointed public criticisms of the Fed.\nOnce a central bank ventures into fiscal policy, it is likely to find itself under increasing pressure from the\nprivate sector, financial markets, or the government to use its balance sheet to substitute for other fiscal\ndecisions. Such actions by a central bank can create their own form of moral hazard, as markets and\ngovernments come to see central banks as instruments of fiscal policy, thus undermining incentives for\n3\n\n\ffiscal discipline. This pressure can threaten the central bank’s independence in conducting monetary\npolicy and thereby undermine monetary policy’s effectiveness in achieving its mandate.\nIn my view, this blurring of the boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies is fraught with risks. As\nI said, these boundaries arose for good reason, and we ignore their breach at our peril. I believe we\nmust seek ways to restore the boundaries.\nThe Central Bank’s Balance-Sheet Policy\nAnother related issue facing central banks arises from the degree to which central banks have expanded\ntheir balance sheets. There are two dimensions to this issue. One is the composition of the balance\nsheet. In the U.S., for example, the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve has changed from one made\nup almost entirely of short-term U.S. Treasury securities to one that is mostly long-term Treasuries, plus\nsignificant quantities of long-term mortgage-backed securities. This concentration of housing-related\nsecurities is problematic because it is a form of credit allocation and thus violates the monetary/fiscal\npolicy boundaries I just mentioned.\nThe second aspect is the overall size of the balance sheet. Many central banks expanded their balance\nsheets in an effort to ease monetary policy after their usual policy instrument – an interest rate — had\nreached the zero lower bound. Do central bankers anticipate that their balance sheets will shrink to\nmore normal levels as they move away from the zero lower bound? Is it desirable to do so? Or should\nmonetary policy now be seen as having another tool, even in normal times? Some have suggested that\ncentral banks adopt a regime in which the monetary policy rate is the interest rate on reserves rather\nthan a market interest rate, such as the federal funds rate. This would then permit the central bank to\nmanage its balance sheet separately from its monetary instrument, freeing it to respond to liquidity\ndemands of the financial system without altering the stance of monetary policy. In principle, this would\ntake pressure off central banks to shrink their balance sheets from the current high levels and simply\nrely on raising the interest rate on reserves to tighten monetary policy.\nThe alternative is to return to a more traditional operating regime in which the central bank sets a target\nfor a market interest rate, such as the federal funds rate in the U.S., above the interest rate on reserves.\nImplementing this regime would require a smaller balance sheet.\nI am very skeptical of an operating regime that gives central banks a new tool without boundaries or\nconstraints. Without an understanding, or even a theory, as to how the balance sheet should or can be\nmanipulated, we open the door to giving vast new discretionary abilities to our central banks. This\nviolates the principle of drawing clear boundaries between monetary policy and fiscal policy. When\nmarkets or governments come to believe that a central bank can freely expand its balance sheet without\ndirectly impacting the stance of monetary policy, I believe that various political and private interests will\ncome forward with a long list of good causes, or rescues, for which such funds could or should be used.\nEconomic theory and practice teach us that monetary policy works best when it is clear about its\nobjectives and systematic in its approach to achieving those objectives. Granting vast amounts of\ndiscretion to our central banks in the expectation that they can cure our economic ills or substitute for\nour lack of fiscal discipline is a dangerous road to follow.\nIn June, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee outlined some principles that would guide its\nexit from this period of extraordinary monetary accommodation. In my view, those principles\n4\n\n\frepresented an important first step in the FOMC’s attempt to restore the boundaries between monetary\nand fiscal policies. In particular, the FOMC clearly stated its desire to return to an operating\nenvironment in which the federal funds rate is the primary instrument of monetary policy. To achieve\nthat objective, the Fed will have to shrink its balance sheet to a more normal level. I interpret this as\nsaying that our balance sheet should not be viewed as a new independent instrument of monetary\npolicy in normal times. The exit principles also indicated the Committee’s desire to return the Fed’s\nbalance sheet to an all-Treasuries portfolio. This re-establishes the idea that the Fed should not use its\nbalance sheet to actively engage in credit allocations.\nIn other speeches, I have outlined a framework that I have termed a “new accord” between the Federal\nReserve and the Treasury. It would enable the central bank to act in emergencies when requested by\nthe Treasury or the fiscal authorities, but it would be clear up front that any non-Treasury assets that\naccrued on the central bank’s balance sheet would be swapped for government securities within a\nspecified period of time. This would ensure that fiscal policy decisions remain under the purview of the\nfiscal authorities, not the central bank.\nSummary\nTo summarize, it is important for governments to maintain independent central banks so that they are\nbetter able to achieve their mandates. It is also sound policy to limit the discretionary ability of central\nbanks to engage in policies that fundamentally belong to fiscal authorities or private markets.\nEstablishing and maintaining clear boundaries between monetary and fiscal policies protects the\nindependence of the central bank and its ability to carry out its core mandate — maintaining price\nstability. Clear boundaries and resisting the use of the balance sheet as a new policy tool would also\nimprove fiscal discipline by making it more difficult for the fiscal authorities to resort to the printing\npress as a solution to unsustainable budget policies.\n\n5\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fA Progress Report on Our Monetary Policy Framework\nForecasters Club\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 29, 2012\n\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nI am pleased to be here today, and I will do my best to avoid all the hackneyed forecaster jokes. I am\nsure you have heard them all anyway. I will simply note that I have often said that forecasting can be a\nhumbling experience in the best of times but I have learned some lessons along the way. For example,\none Thursday morning not long ago, a reporter asked me what I thought the monthly employment\nnumbers would show when they were released the next day. I responded that I had been around long\nenough to learn never to predict anything about which I can be proven right or wrong within a week and\ncertainly not within 24 hours. It simply doesn’t pay.\nSo, in lieu of a typical forecasting speech today, I would like to discuss the recent steps taken by the\nFederal Reserve to improve the transparency of monetary policy. These important initiatives are\nintended to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy as well as the accountability of our central\nbank.\nOver the last few years, I have spoken frequently about the need to improve transparency and to bring\nour monetary policy framework into the 21st century.1 In my view, there are four interrelated\ndimensions to a stronger monetary policy framework. The first is to ensure that the central bank\ncommits to a set of clearly articulated objectives that can be feasibly achieved by monetary policy. The\nsecond element requires the central bank to be transparent and clear in its communications. The third\nelement, related to the second, is for the central bank to conduct monetary policy in a systematic or\n1\n\nSee Plosser (2010) and (2011), among others. As always, these views are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n1\n\n\frule‐like manner.2 The fourth element, and arguably the most important, is for the central bank to set\nmonetary policy independently from the fiscal authorities.\nAs many of you know, last year Chairman Bernanke asked Governor Yellen, Governor Raskin, Chicago\nFed President Evans, and me to serve on a subcommittee whose task was to develop recommendations\nto improve the Federal Open Market Committee’s communications. In January, the FOMC adopted two\ninitiatives brought forward by the subcommittee.\nI want to review these initiatives today and how they relate to my broader views on a stronger\nmonetary policy framework. Of course, improving policy transparency will always be a work in progress.\nSo, I will also talk about additional steps I believe we could take to further improve our framework for\nconducting policy.\nStatement of Principles\nThe first communications initiative adopted by the FOMC was to issue a consensus statement of\nprinciples about its long‐run policy goals and objectives. The statement makes four very significant\npoints in clarifying our policy objectives.\nFirst, the statement reaffirms the Committee’s commitment to its congressional mandate to promote\n“maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long‐term interest rates.”\nMore important, the statement gives texture to those objectives in a way never before articulated. In\nparticular, the statement’s second significant point stresses that inflation over the longer run is mainly\ndetermined by monetary policy. In this sense, the FOMC acknowledges what every economist has\nknown for over two centuries: inflation is a monetary phenomenon. Therefore, it is both appropriate\nand feasible for the monetary authority to set an inflation goal and be held accountable for achieving it.\nThe Committee, therefore, adopted a long‐term inflation goal of 2 percent, as measured by the annual\nchange in the price index for personal consumption expenditures. By establishing an explicit inflation\ntarget, the Federal Reserve is adopting a practice used by most major central banks around the world\nand one that is acknowledged as a best practice by academics and central bankers.\n\n2\n\nSee Dotsey and Plosser (2012) and Plosser (2008).\n\n2\n\n\fA third important point made in the statement is that it is not appropriate for the central bank to set an\nexplicit numerical goal for the maximum employment part of our mandate. Maximum employment is\nmainly determined by nonmonetary factors, such as demographics, technological change and\nproductivity, the structure of the labor market, and governmental policies – for example, minimum\nwage laws, unemployment benefits, retirement incentives, and taxes. Since these factors change over\ntime, the concept of maximum employment can also change over time. While policymakers consider a\nwide range of indicators to assess employment, the value of such indicators is subject to considerable\nuncertainty. Economists, for example, can, and often do, have very different assessments of what the\nlevel of maximum employment is at any point in time. This arises because different models suggest\ndifferent conceptual definitions, most of which are not directly observable. So, monetary policy should\nnot seek to achieve an explicit objective for something it does not directly control and cannot accurately\nmeasure.\nFourth, the statement notes that, in general, price stability and maximum employment are\ncomplementary. Price stability promotes economic efficiency by giving individuals and businesses more\nconfidence that the purchasing power of the dollar will not erode. Conversely, the failure to maintain\nprice stability can often lead to greater instability in employment and output. When inflation rises to\nunacceptable levels, as it did in the 1970s, monetary policy will be forced to react to restore price\nstability. This, in turn, could lead to increased instability in employment and output, as it did in the\nrecession in the early 1980s. But the FOMC’s consensus statement of principles also acknowledges that\nin the short run, the maximum employment and price stability parts of the Fed’s mandate could be in\nconflict. In such circumstances, monetary policy will seek to follow a balanced approach in promoting its\nstatutory mandate.\nThe consensus statement does not provide answers for all the hard policy choices. How best to\nimplement this balanced approach requires judgment and may well differ across policymakers who may\nhave different models of the economy even as they work to promote the same long‐term goals for\nmonetary policy.\nImprovements in the Summary of Economic Projections\nThe second important step the Committee took in January toward increased transparency involved the\neconomic projections that the FOMC releases four times a year. The Summary of Economic Projections,\nor SEP for short, summarizes the individual FOMC policymakers’ views on the economy as reflected in\n3\n\n\fseveral key economic variables, including output, inflation, and unemployment. Yet, these projections\nare not forecasts in the usual sense. Each policymaker’s projections are conditioned on the\npolicymaker’s assessment of “appropriate policy,” that is, the policy path that he or she views as the\nmost likely to yield the best outcomes for the economy in the absence of further shocks.\nThis policy path isn’t necessarily the most likely path; instead, it is the path viewed as being the best\npolicy. Thus, the projections should not be compared with the forecasts of private‐sector forecasters\nwho try to predict what the Fed’s next move might be. Instead, each policymaker makes economic\nprojections based on an assessment of the best policy path to achieve the most desirable outcomes.\nUntil January, the SEP did not reveal any information about the appropriate paths assumed by the\nparticipants. This lack of information about the underlying policy assumptions made it difficult to know\nwhat the SEP represented. For example, two participants may be projecting the same long‐run inflation\nrate, but they may believe it will take very different policy paths to achieve that outcome.\nOther central banks, such as those of Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, have provided information\nabout the assumed path of policy. In January, the Fed joined them and began releasing information on\nthe underlying policy paths assumed by the participants in their economic projections. These policy\npaths are summarized in two charts. The most important chart displays the level of the federal funds\nrate assumed by each participant at the end of each calendar year for three years out and for the longer\nrun. This information provides a useful picture of the range of views of future policy assumed by\npolicymakers. Note once again that these are assumptions, not forecasts in the usual sense. For\nexample, I might submit a very different projection of inflation rates if I were asked to use someone\nelse’s policy path or even the policy path implicitly assumed in the fed funds futures market.\nIt is also important to emphasize that these policy assessments do not constitute a commitment to\nfollow a particular path but will evolve as economic conditions evolve. In fact, I believe that changes in\nthis chart over time will prove to be a far better way to provide information about the path of policy\nthan using calendar dates, as we are currently doing in our FOMC statements. Policy should be\nconditioned on the state of the economy, not the calendar. Observers watching how these policy paths\nevolve as the economy improves are likely to learn more about the timing and magnitude of future\npolicy actions. This then will reveal more about the policymakers’ reaction function, on which I will have\nmore to say in a moment.\n\n4\n\n\fFrom my perspective, our actions in January were important steps forward. We clarified our goals and\nobjectives, and we became more transparent about our views of future policy.\nMore to Do\nOf course, as I mentioned at the outset, improving the transparency of our communications and\nstrengthening our policy framework is a work in progress. More can be done.\nFirst, as a way to increase transparency, I believe the SEP should include more information about the\nlinkages among the economic variables and the associated policy paths. Even with the recent\nimprovements, the public cannot link a policy path to a particular set of projections for output, inflation,\nand unemployment in the SEP. That is only possible when individual policymakers choose to reveal such\ninformation in their speeches and other public communications. A natural next step would be to include\na matrix of output, inflation, and unemployment, and the associated policy path assumptions that each\npolicymaker submitted. This would make the information in the SEP easier to interpret and give a better\nsense of the linkage between changes in economic conditions and policy.\nSecond, I believe the Federal Reserve should do a more comprehensive monetary policy report four\ntimes a year. Currently, the Chairman testifies before Congress twice a year – in fact, he is doing so\ntoday – and that testimony is accompanied by a written report. In addition, the Chairman holds press\nbriefings four times a year to summarize the SEP. I think there is an opportunity to combine these\nefforts in a more comprehensive report on monetary policy. Most central banks that have adopted an\ninflation target have also sought to improve communication and transparency through the publication\nof a regular policy report. In the U.K., for example, the Bank of England issues a quarterly Inflation\nReport. Other countries produce a Monetary Policy Report that discusses the central bank’s forecasts\nand the longer‐term context of policy. These reports offer an opportunity to reinforce the underlying\nframework the central bank has adopted for the conduct of policy. I think the Fed should consider\nproducing a similar report to elaborate and reinforce its policy framework and how it relates to\neconomic conditions. These reports will help improve the public’s understanding of policy, which will\nhelp make policy more effective and the central bank more accountable.\nThird, I believe the FOMC should adopt clearer guidelines on how policy evolves with economic\nconditions. The better the public and the markets understand how policy is likely to be adjusted as the\n\n5\n\n\feconomy changes, the more predictable policy becomes, which promotes price stability and better\neconomic outcomes.\nThe history of U.S. monetary policy is filled with stops and starts and changes in direction, yet the Fed\nhas communicated little about what drives those decisions. Indeed, historically, central bankers have\ntended not to reveal such information, since they preferred discretionary policy over systematic policy.\nOf course, policymakers do not know with any degree of certainty how economic conditions will evolve.\nSo they cannot and should not say with any certainty what policy will be in the future. But policymakers\ncan provide information about the factors that will influence their policy decisions. Some call this a\npolicy rule. Milton Friedman advocated a rule in the form of a k‐percent growth rate of the money\nsupply. John Taylor devised a rule that depends on a measure of inflation relative to a target and some\nmeasure of resource utilization. Other versions of the Taylor rule involve a degree of smoothing to\nminimize sharp swings in the policy rate. A policy rule is also called a reaction function or response\nfunction because it describes how policy will evolve as key economic conditions evolve.\nI believe that the Fed should provide more information about its reaction function. The practice of using\nsystematic rules as guides to monetary policy imposes an important discipline on policymaking and\nimproves communication and transparency. This is because systematic rules make policy more\npredictable and therefore helps the public and markets make better decisions. Moreover, if\npolicymakers choose to deviate from the guidelines, they are forced to explain why and how they\nanticipate returning to normal operating practices. Systematic policy also reduces the temptation to\nengage in discretionary policies.\nI believe the Committee is still some way from agreeing on one systematic policy rule or reaction\nfunction. Such choices will involve elaborate discussions and agreement on the appropriate class of\nmodels and an agreed‐upon loss function. One way to move toward more systematic policy would be\nto describe the variables that are important for our response function. The academic literature suggests\nusing rules that respond aggressively to deviations of inflation from the central bank’s target and less\naggressively to deviations of output from some concept of “potential output.” Research has found that\nsuch rules perform fairly well in a variety of models and frameworks.3\n\n3\n\nSee Orphanides and Williams (2002).\n\n6\n\n\fThus, it is reasonable and feasible for the Fed to describe policy in terms of the variables in a rule that is\nrobust across models. We would not have to articulate a precise mathematical rule but would provide\nthe key variables and then communicate policy decisions in terms of changes in these key variables. If\npolicy were changed, then we would explain that change based on how the variables in our response\nfunction have changed. If we choose a consistent set of variables and systematically use them to\ndescribe our policy choices, the public will have a greater ability to form judgments about the likely\ncourse of policy. This would reduce uncertainty about policy and promote stability.\nThere is one more item on my list of things to do. At the beginning of my remarks, I stressed the\nimportance of maintaining the independence of the central bank. That independence is now under\nattack. Last week, I gave a speech on the fraying boundaries between monetary and fiscal policy.4 I\nnoted that while monetary policy and fiscal policy are intertwined through the government’s budget\nconstraint, there are good reasons to maintain clear boundaries between the two. Specifically, in a\nworld where fiscal discipline is lacking, governments without the institutional or constitutional\nguarantees of an independent central bank often resort to money creation as a solution to fiscal\nproblems. This, of course, is a recipe for high rates of inflation and, in the extreme, hyperinflation. For\nthis reason, countries throughout the world have moved over the last 60 years to strengthen the\nindependence of their central banks. It is simply good governance to keep a healthy degree of\nseparation between those responsible for tax and spending policies and those responsible for monetary\ncreation.\nThe pressure on independence stems, in part, from fiscal imbalances and the inability of governments to\ndevelop credible and sustainable plans to finance public expenditures. In turn, the pressure can\nmanifest itself in calls for higher inflation or for central banks to act as lenders of last resort for failing\ngovernments. Yet central banks have also contributed to the breakdown of the boundaries by engaging\nin credit allocations to particular sectors, such as housing, and bailouts to particular firms, such as Bear\nSterns. Thus, the fiscal authorities and supposedly independent central banks have acted in ways that\nundermine central bank independence. I believe this is a dangerous path and one that needs to be\nchanged. We need to restore the boundaries.\n\n4\n\nSee Plosser (2012).\n\n7\n\n\fConclusions\nTo summarize, the FOMC has taken significant actions toward greater transparency, most recently with\nthe historic steps adopted in January. These steps in turn help to promote better public understanding\nof the rationale behind the FOMC’s decisions. First, we released a statement clarifying the long‐run\ngoals of monetary policy and our policymaking strategy. Second, we began releasing information about\nthe policy paths that underlie our economic projections.\nYet, I believe there is more that can be done. We can and should provide more details about the\ninterplay between economic conditions and policy. We can also better define our reaction function, to\nenable the public to better understand and anticipate future policy actions. Economic research has\nshown that increased transparency can improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, as well as the\nFed’s accountability with the public. These benefits underscore the importance of our continued pursuit\nof finding better ways to communicate our framework for monetary policy decisions.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\nDotsey, Michael, and Charles I.

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nI am pleased to participate in this important forum once again. I am particularly delighted to be a part\nof such a distinguished panel. This conference has rapidly become one of the premier venues for\nserious discussions of monetary policy and I am honored to be a part of it.\nFiscal Imbalances\nDuring the past year, we have witnessed the ongoing saga of governments, both in Europe and in the\nU.S., struggling with large deficits and soaring public debt. For the most part, these challenges are self‐\ninflicted. They are the result of governments choosing fiscal policies that they knew would be\nunsustainable in the long run. Financial market participants remain skeptical about whether the political\nprocess can come to grips with the problems. So far, this skepticism appears to be wholly justified.\nNeither the European nor the American political process has developed credible and sustainable plans\nto finance public spending. Instead, politicians continue to engage in protracted debates over who will\nbear the burden of the substantial adjustments needed to put fiscal policies back on a sustainable path.\nIn my view, these prolonged debates impede economic growth, in part, due to the uncertainty they\nimpose on consumers and businesses. Moreover, the longer the delay in developing credible plans, the\nmore costly it becomes for the respective economies.\nGiven the magnitude of the fiscal shortfalls, the way in which the political process restores fiscal\ndiscipline will have profound implications for years to come. Will there be higher taxes on investments\nby the private sector that risk reducing productive capacity and output in the future? Will there be\n\n1\n\n\fhigher taxes on labor that discourage work effort or hiring? Will there be cutbacks in government\nexpenditures on defense or basic research that might force significant resource reallocations and affect\na wide array of industry sectors? Will there be cutbacks on entitlements that could affect health care,\nsocial insurance, and other aspects of our safety net? Or will a viable fiscal plan combine various types\nof tax increases and spending cuts?\nThese are important questions that involve hard choices and trade‐offs between efficiency and equity.\nYet, until fiscal authorities choose a path, uncertainty encourages firms to defer hiring and investment\ndecisions and complicates the financial planning of individuals and businesses. The longer it takes to\nreach a resolution on a credible, sustainable plan to reduce future deficits and limit the ratio of public\ndebt to gross domestic product, or GDP, the more damage is done to the economy in the near term.\nSome observers say cyclical factors and the magnitude of the recent global recession caused the current\nfiscal crisis. It is certainly true that the policy choices made by governments to deal with the financial\ncrisis and ensuing recession have caused a significant deterioration in fiscal balances and debt levels in\nmany countries. However, the underlying trends that are at the root of unsustainable fiscal deficits in\nmany countries, including the U.S., have been in place and known for some time. In the U.S., for\nexample, the major long‐run drivers of the structural deficit at the federal level are entitlements such as\nhealth care and Social Security.1\nThus, even after cyclical effects play out, many countries will continue to have large structural budget\ndeficits. In this sense, the financial crisis and recession have simply exacerbated the underlying\nproblems and perhaps moved up the day of reckoning. In some cases, such as Greece, that day has\ncome. In light of these realities, market participants have begun to question the solvency of\ngovernments and their ability to honor their sovereign debt obligations in the absence of deep structural\nreforms. In Europe, the doubts have greatly complicated the political problems as various countries\ndebate the question of “who pays” for the anticipated bad debts of individual countries. Here, too, the\nprotracted nature of the political debate creates uncertainty, which undermines economic growth and\nexacerbates the crisis. While some have argued that preventing Greek default would keep the crisis\nfrom spreading, that argument has proven false.\n\n1\n\nIn other countries and jurisdictions, such as the state and local level, pension and entitlement commitments also account for\na significant source of the growth in commitments and thus are central to the fiscal problems.\n\n2\n\n\fThe Interaction of Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy\nThe fiscal challenges alone are daunting. Yet, they can also have profound implications for monetary\npolicy and the role of central banks. Today, I want to focus my remarks on that interaction between\nmonetary policy and fiscal policy. Of course, the appropriate relationship between the two is not a new\ntopic. Yet, it has taken on new relevance and importance as a result of the recent crisis and the actions\nundertaken by policymakers. Let me elaborate.\nIt is widely understood that governments can finance expenditures through taxation, debt, or printing\nmoney. In this sense, monetary and fiscal policy are intertwined through the government budget\nconstraint. Nevertheless, there are good reasons to prefer an arrangement that provides a fair degree\nof separation between the functions and responsibilities of central banks and those of the fiscal\nauthorities. For example, in a world of fiat currency, central banks are generally assigned the\nresponsibility for establishing and maintaining the value or purchasing power of the nation’s monetary\nunit of account. Yet, that task can be undermined or completely subverted if fiscal authorities\nindependently set their budgets in a manner that ultimately requires the central bank to finance\ngovernment expenditures with significant amounts of seigniorage in lieu of tax revenues or debt.2 The\nability of the central bank to maintain price stability can also be undermined when the central bank itself\nventures into the realm of fiscal policy.\nImagine a situation in which public debt levels are high and rising. Now stretch your mind even more\nand imagine that fiscal policymakers are reluctant to make the hard choices of cutting expenditures or\nincreasing taxes. Of course, neither of these assumptions requires much imagination. Indeed, history\nand our daily newspapers provide numerous examples. Unless governments are constrained\ninstitutionally or constitutionally, they often resort to the printing press to try to escape their budget\nproblems. Yet, we all understand that this option is a recipe for creating substantial inflation.3 Indeed,\nhistory shows that it is often a path toward hyperinflation.4\n\n2\n\nSee Sargent and Wallace (1981).\n\n3\n\nInflation, of course, is also a tax. It is a hidden tax on holding nominal assets, and when it is unanticipated, it can have\nsignificant consequences that redistribute wealth from creditors to debtors. The near‐term effects of money creation often\nappear to be positive, while the undesirable consequences only become apparent over time. While money creation results in\nlower nominal interest rates and perhaps a modest boost to real activity in the short run, over time, it results in higher inflation\nand higher nominal interest rates and ultimately requires painful efforts to restore price stability.\n\n4\n\nSome of the more notable examples include Germany, Hungary, and Austria after World War I. Hungary and Greece\nexperienced hyperinflations after World War II. More recently, countries from South and Central America have had episodes of\n\n3\n\n\fAwareness of these long‐term consequences of excessive money creation is the reason that over the\npast 60 years, country after country has moved to establish and maintain independent central banks.\nWithout the protections afforded by independence, the temptation of governments to exploit the\nprinting press in the absence of fiscal discipline is just too great. Thus, it is simply good governance and\nwise economic policy to maintain a healthy separation between those responsible for tax and spending\npolicy and those responsible for money creation.\nBut it is equally important that independent central banks be constrained from using their own authority\nto engage in activities that enter the realm of fiscal policy or distort private markets.5\nThere are several ways to place limits on central banks so that the boundaries between monetary and\nfiscal policy remain clear:6\nFirst, the central bank can be given a narrow mandate, such as price stability. In fact, this has been a\nprominent trend during the last 25 years. Many major central banks now have price stability as their\nsole or primary mandate.\nSecond, the central bank can be restricted as to the type of assets it can hold on its balance sheet. This\nlimits its ability to engage in credit policies or resource allocations that rightfully belong under the\npurview of the fiscal authorities or the private marketplace.\nThird, the central bank can conduct its monetary policy in a more systematic or rule‐like manner, which\nlimits the scope for discretionary actions that might violate the boundaries between monetary and fiscal\npolicy. Milton Friedman’s famous k‐percent money growth rule is one example, as are Taylor‐type rules.\nSuch approaches to systematic policy can be a commitment device that limits discretionary behavior and\nthus helps to solve time‐consistency problems.\nThe Breakdown of the Accepted Boundaries\nUnfortunately, over the past few years, the combination of a financial crisis and sustained fiscal\nimbalances has led to a substantial breakdown in the institutional framework and the accepted barriers\n\nhyperinflation, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Zimbabwe is the most recent example, and its\nhyperinflation episode ended with a currency reform in 2008.\n5\n\nSee Plosser (2010) for further discussion on the risks of unconstrained policy tools and the necessity of commitment devices.\n\n6\n\nSargent (2010) has a thoughtful and insightful discussion on these and related issues.\n\n4\n\n\fbetween monetary and fiscal policy. The pressure has come from both sides. Governments are pushing\ncentral banks to exceed their monetary boundaries and central banks are stepping into areas not\npreviously viewed as acceptable for an independent central bank. Let me give you some examples.\nI will start with what I see as a not‐so‐subtle undermining of the commitment to price stability. Despite\nthe well‐known benefits of maintaining stable prices, there are calls in both Europe and the U.S. to\nabandon this commitment and create higher inflation to devalue outstanding nominal government and\nprivate debt. Such an inflation tax would transfer wealth from those who have lent money, in good\nfaith, to the borrowers. I am deeply skeptical of such a strategy. In my view, inflation is a blunt and\ninappropriate instrument for assigning winners and losers from profligate fiscal policy or excessive\nborrowing by private individuals and firms. Forced redistributions of this kind, if undertaken at all,\nshould be done through the political process and by the fiscal authorities, not through the backdoor by\nthe central bank by way of inflationist policies. As a monetary policymaker, I do not want to be\ncomplicit in such a strategy. Moreover, history has shown that once inflation is unleashed, it is not\nalways easy to bring it back down, especially if the central bank loses the public’s confidence and\ndamages the credibility of its commitment to price stability. Thus, proposals to use inflation to fix the\ndebt overhang problem are nothing more than a call for debt monetization to solve a problem that is\nfundamentally fiscal in nature.\nPressure on central banks is also showing up through other channels. In some circles, it has become\nfashionable to invoke “lender of last resort” arguments as a reason for central banks to engage in fiscal\nactions. This is a strained argument at best. The basic role of a lender of last resort is to provide\nliquidity to financial institutions that are solvent but facing temporary liquidity problems. Yet recently,\nsome have used the concept to argue that the central bank should be the lender of last resort to\ngovernments. This is a perversion of one of central banking’s core concepts. It is a fig leaf to conceal\nthe process of monetizing the sovereign debt of those countries that are insolvent due to their inability\nto manage their fiscal affairs. Monetary policy should not be used to solve a fiscal crisis.\nUnfortunately, from my perspective, breaching the boundaries is not confined to the fiscal authorities\nasking central banks to do their heavy lifting The Fed and other central banks have also undertaken\nactions that have blurred the distinction between monetary policy, credit policy, and fiscal policy. These\nsteps were undertaken with the sincere belief that they were absolutely necessary to address the\nchallenges posed by the financial crisis.\n5\n\n\fFor example, the Fed established credit facilities to support particular asset classes, such as commercial\npaper and asset‐backed securities. In November 2008, the Fed announced it would begin purchasing\nhousing agency mortgage‐backed securities and agency debt to increase the availability and reduce the\ncost of credit in the housing sector. When the Fed engages in targeted credit programs that seek to\nalter the allocation of credit across markets, I believe it is engaging in fiscal policy and has breached the\ntraditional boundaries established between the fiscal authorities and the central bank. Indeed, some of\nthese actions have generated pointed criticisms of the Fed.\nI view the breakdown of the traditional institutional arrangements as dangerous and fraught with\nlonger‐term risks. While it is popular to view such blurring of the boundaries as appropriate\n“cooperation” or “coordination” between the monetary and fiscal authorities, the boundaries were\nestablished for good reasons and we ignore them at our own peril.\nRestoring the Boundaries\nOnce a central bank ventures into fiscal policy, it is likely to find itself under increasing pressure from the\nprivate sector, financial markets, or the government to use its balance sheet to substitute for other fiscal\ndecisions. Such actions by a central bank can create their own form of moral hazard, as markets and\ngovernments come to see central banks as instruments of fiscal policy, thus undermining incentives for\nfiscal discipline. This pressure can threaten the central bank’s independence in conducting monetary\npolicy and thereby undermine monetary policy’s effectiveness in achieving its mandate.\nI have long argued for a bright line between monetary policy and fiscal policy, for the independence of\nthe central bank, and for the central bank to have clear and transparent objectives. I have also stressed\nthe importance of a systematic approach to monetary policy that serves to limit discretionary actions by\nthe central bank. At this conference three years ago, I argued for a new accord between the Treasury\nand the central bank that would severely limit, if not eliminate, the ability of the central bank to lend to\nprivate individuals and firms outside of the discount window mechanisms.7 I argued that decisions to\ngrant subsidies to particular market segments should rest with the fiscal authorities – in the U.S., this\nmeans the Congress and the Treasury Department – and not with the central bank. Thus, I proposed\nthat the new accord limit the Fed to an all‐Treasuries portfolio, except for those assets held as collateral\nfor traditional discount window operations. Should the fiscal authority ask the central bank to engage in\n7\n\nSee Plosser (2009) and Plosser (2010).\n\n6\n\n\flending outside of its normal operations, the fiscal authority should exchange government securities for\nthe nongovernment assets that would accumulate on the central bank’s balance sheet as a result. This\ntype of swap would ensure that the full authority and responsibility for fiscal matters remained with the\nTreasury and Congress and the Fed’s balance sheet remained essentially all Treasuries.\nCongress has mandated the goals of monetary policy to promote price stability, maximum employment,\nand moderate long‐term interest rates. Asking monetary policy to take on ever more fiscal\nresponsibilities undermines the discipline of the fiscal authorities and the independence of the central\nbank. Central banks and monetary policy are not and cannot be real solutions to the unsustainable fiscal\npaths many countries currently face. The only real answer rests with the fiscal authorities’ ability to\ndevelop credible commitments to sustainable fiscal paths. It is a difficult and painful task to be sure, but\na monetary solution is a bridge to nowhere at best, and the road to perdition at worst – a world of rising\nand costly inflation and a weakening of fiscal discipline.\n\nReferences\nPlosser, Charles I., “Credible Commitments and Monetary Policy After the Crisis,” speech presented at\nthe Swiss National Bank Monetary Policy Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 24, 2010.\nPlosser, Charles I., “Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of Crisis,” speech presented at the\nU.S. Monetary Policy Forum: The Initiative on Global Markets, New York City, February 27, 2009.\nSargent, Thomas, “Where to Draw Lines: Stability versus Efficiency,” New York University Working Paper\n(September 6, 2010).\nSargent, Thomas, and Neil Wallace, “Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic,” Federal Reserve Bank of\nMinneapolis Quarterly Review, 5 (Fall 1981), pp. 1–17.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me back again to the University of Delaware. It has been three\nyears since I last spoke at this event and a lot has happened. Yet, as I will explain, we\nhave come a long way on the road to recovery from the Great Recession. So, this\nmorning I will share with you my take on the economic outlook. Then I want to discuss\nthe hazards of trying to apply ever more monetary accommodation to speed up the\nrecovery process. 1\nEconomic Outlook\nWe are now in the third year of a moderate economic recovery that has had more than\na few bumps along the way. We finished 2011 with real GDP at 1.6 percent, compared\nto 3.1 percent in the prior year. Some of this weakness is perfectly understandable,\ngiven the unexpected shocks we experienced during the year. Yet, the economy\npersevered. Indeed, growth accelerated across each of the four quarters, from less than\nhalf of a percent in the first quarter to around 2-3/4 percent in the fourth quarter. I\n\n1\n\nI should note the usual disclaimer that my views are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal\n\nReserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n1\n\n\fanticipate that we will continue to see moderate growth of around 3 percent in 2012\nand 2013, which is slightly above trend.\nBusiness spending, especially investment in equipment and software, was relatively\nhealthy last year, buoyed by solid growth in corporate earnings. In January, the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey showed that regional manufacturing activity\ncontinued to expand at a moderate pace, the fourth consecutive monthly increase since\na late summer lull. The survey’s measures of future activity also indicated that our\nrespondents expect activity to continue to pick up over the next six months. I take this\nas a sign that business sentiment is also improving.\nOn the housing front, I expect to see stabilization but not much improvement in 2012.\nWe entered the Great Recession over-invested in residential real estate, and we are not\nlikely to see a housing recovery until the surplus inventory of foreclosed and distressed\nproperties declines.\nEven as the economy rebalances, we should not seek, nor should we expect, housing\nand related sectors to return to those pre-recession highs. Those highs were\nunsustainable, and the housing crash that ensued destroyed a great deal of wealth for\nconsumers and the economy as a whole. The losses are real and the consequences\nsevere for many individuals and many businesses. Moreover, monetary policy cannot\npaper over these losses, nor should it try to do so. Households and businesses,\nnevertheless, continue to make progress on restoring the health of their balance sheets\nby paying down debt and increasing savings. Most economists, including me, believe\nthat this process will continue into 2012.\nThe labor market has grown stronger in recent months. Although there are still too\nmany people unemployed in our region and the nation, I am encouraged by the most\nrecent employment reports. The January employment report showed a net gain of\n243,000 jobs, and revisions to November and December added another 60,000 jobs to\nthe recovery. Some have downplayed the report, suggesting that one good data point\n2\n\n\fdoes not make a trend, and I wholeheartedly agree. But what we have seen is more\nthan one data point. Net employment gains were 103,000 in October, 157,000 in\nNovember, 203,000 in December, and 243,000 in January – a clear positive trend.\nThe household survey also reported a significant decline in the unemployment rate.\nHere, too, the trend is encouraging – 8.9 percent in October, 8.7 in November, 8.5 in\nDecember, and 8.3 in January. That is the lowest level in nearly three years. As growth\ncontinues and strengthens, I expect further gradual declines in the unemployment rate,\nwith the rate falling to 8 percent or less, by the end of 2012.\nIn our District, all three states ended 2011 with lower unemployment rates. New\nJersey’s rate, at about 9 percent, is still higher than the national average, but Delaware’s\nand Pennsylvania’s were below the national average, with rates of 7.4 and 7.6 percent,\nrespectively.\nAs we continue down the road to recovery, I expect we will face further hiccups along\nthe way. One significant risk is the potential effects of the continuing sovereign debt\ncrisis in Europe. The economic slowdown in the euro zone will likely restrain U.S.\nexports. And while strains in financial markets have been limited to European\ninstitutions so far, we must continue to monitor events to ensure that there are no\nadverse spillovers to U.S. financial institutions. Of course, regardless of how the\nEuropean situation plays out, it has already imposed considerable uncertainty on\ngrowth prospects for the global economy. Moreover, our own nation’s inability to\nestablish a clear plan to put our fiscal house in order contributes additional uncertainty\nto the economic landscape.\nUntil the economic environment becomes clearer, firms and consumers are likely to\npostpone significant spending and hiring decisions – imposing a drag on the recovery,\neven though economic developments in the U.S. continue to improve.\nInflation risks in the near term remain modest. However, I remain concerned that\nmonetary policy has exposed us to substantial inflation risk over the medium to longer\n3\n\n\fterm. Total inflation in 2011, as measured by the consumer price index on a year-overyear basis, was 3 percent, reflecting strong increases in energy and food prices,\nparticularly in the early part of the year. The personal consumption expenditures price\nindex rose 2.4 percent. While these inflation rates exceed our target, I anticipate that\nwith many commodity prices now leveling off or falling, and inflation expectations\nrelatively stable, inflation will remain moderate in the near term. My forecast is that\ninflation will settle around 2 percent in 2012.\nYet, inflation often develops gradually, and if monetary policy waits too long to respond,\nit can be very costly to correct. Measures of slack such as the unemployment rate are\noften thought to prevent inflation from rising. But that did not turn out to be true in the\n1970s. Thus, we need to proceed with caution and be circumspect as to the degree of\nmonetary accommodation we supply to the economy. So let me review some of the\npolicy actions the Fed has taken.\nMonetary Policy\nAs you know, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero for more than three\nyears to support the recovery. We have also conducted two rounds of asset purchases\nthat have more than tripled the size of the balance sheet and changed its composition\nfrom short-term Treasuries to longer-term Treasuries and housing-related securities,\nmostly mortgage-backed securities. Today, we are in a modest recovery from a deep\nrecession and financial crisis. The financial crisis has passed, however, and monetary\npolicy should not continue to act as if the crisis was still with us.\nIn January, the Federal Open Market Committee announced that economic conditions\nwere “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least\nthrough late 2014” – that’s almost three years from now. And that is 18 months longer\nthan the mid-2013 calendar date first signaled last August. In addition, the Committee\nannounced that the Fed intends to continue the maturity extension program, or\n“operation twist,” first launched last September. In this program, the Fed is buying $400\n4\n\n\fbillion of longer-term Treasuries and selling an equal amount of shorter-term Treasuries,\nin an effort to reduce yields from already historically low levels. The FOMC is also\ncontinuing to reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and MBS into\nMBS in an effort to help mortgage markets.\nYou may know that I dissented from the FOMC decisions in August and September\nbecause it was not clear to me that further monetary policy accommodation was\nappropriate. After all, inflation was higher and unemployment was lower relative to the\nprevious year.\nIn addition, I do not support the practice of offering forward policy guidance by saying\neconomic conditions are likely to lead to low rates through some calendar date. Such\nstatements are, in my mind, particularly problematic from a communications\nperspective. Monetary policy should be contingent on the economic environment and\nnot on the calendar.\nThus, I was not supportive of the Committee’s actions in January. I think that economic\nconditions, as they have evolved since late last year, do not call for further\naccommodation. In fact, the economy has actually improved. Moreover, I continue to\noppose using calendar dates to communicate forward guidance.\nYet, despite the extraordinary steps taken to support the economy, many argue that\nmonetary policy should do more. The argument is that while inflation may be close to\nour target, unemployment remains elevated, and thus, monetary policy must act more\naggressively if it is to meet its mandated employment objective.\nI disagree and believe that doing so would lead us down a very treacherous path – one\nthat would be ever more difficult to navigate and one that would increase the already\nsubstantial risk of higher inflation. But the problem is not just inflation risk down the\nroad. Prolonged efforts to hold interest rates near zero can lead to financial market\ndistortions and the misallocation of resources.\n\n5\n\n\fLet me offer an analogy that might help you visualize the risks.\nImagine you’re driving a car down the Delaware Turnpike on a rainy and foggy day on\nthe way to a birthday party for your mother. Unfortunately, you can’t see very far\nahead because of the weather, and you don’t know exactly how far you are from the\nexit. You are anxious because you don’t want to miss the party. Your children are in the\nback seat, giddy with excitement about seeing their grandmother. So you decide to go a\nlittle faster. You accelerate.\nAfter some time passes, you still think you are some distance from your exit. The\nchildren are now fidgeting in the back seat, and you don’t want to be late, so you decide\nto step on the gas a little more. Now, you are speeding, hoping to get to your\ndestination sooner. Eventually, though, as you are flying down the highway, you finally\ncatch a glimpse of the exit through the fog and rain, only now you are going too fast to\nsafely navigate the off ramp. You are faced with two very unattractive options.\nOne option is to slam on the brakes to make the exit. This strategy risks causing a\nmulticar accident, as your abrupt efforts to slow down surprises drivers behind you who\nhad expected you to continue at high speed. The result is an accident, perhaps injuries\nto innocent people, and maybe a severe traffic jam, diverting or delaying many others.\nThe second option is to continue down the road to the next exit, turn around, and then\nbacktrack to the right exit. This strategy means that you are late, you miss the party,\nyou disappoint everyone, you pay extra for tolls and gas, and you incur numerous other\ncosts in the process.\nMonetary policy is sometimes criticized for such “go-stop” policies. Policymakers step\non the accelerator aggressively, only to slam on the brakes in order to change course.\nSuch an approach to policy can be highly destabilizing, creating added volatility for\nfinancial markets and the economy.\nI would add that constant acceleration only makes these risks even more hazardous.\nSlamming on the brakes or abruptly changing course could disrupt the economy. Failing\n6\n\n\fto slow down and exit at the right time risks excessive inflation, which then has to be\ncontrolled. It also risks the misallocation of resources and capital, and perhaps even\ncredit bubbles or other distortions that could pose problems for the economy.\nThus, in my mind, such an accelerationist approach to monetary policy is risky and the\npotential costs may be quite high. It is an approach most often driven by an excessive\nfocus on the short run and perhaps some hubris that we will be able to successfully\navert the risks such a strategy poses for the economy over the longer run.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth of around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, with job growth strengthening and\nthe unemployment rate falling gradually over time. I believe inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and inflation will moderate in the near term. However, with the very\naccommodative stance of monetary policy, we must guard against the medium- and\nlonger-term risks of inflation and the potential for distortions such accommodation can\ncreate.\nFinally, I believe we must also guard against an accelerationist approach to policy – one\nthat calls for monetary policy to do more and more in an attempt to get to our\nobjectives that much faster. The risks to economic stability of such an approach over\nthe medium term could be quite high and could jeopardize our ability to achieve our\nlonger-terms goals.\n\n7\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nGood morning and thank you for inviting me to participate in the 2012 Economic\nForecast Breakfast. We are in that season when traditionally we reflect upon the past\nyear and look ahead. So in the spirit of the season, I will give you my take on the\neconomic outlook. Then I want to spend the remainder of my time discussing recent\nsteps taken by the FOMC to enhance the way we communicate about monetary policy.\nBefore I begin, though, I should note that one of the strengths of the Federal Reserve\nSystem and its Federal Open Market Committee is that it brings together a wide range\nof independent assessments of economic conditions and perspectives on policy. As that\nfamous American journalist Walter Lippmann once said: “Where all men think alike, no\none thinks very much.” So let me assure you that there is a lot of thinking going on\namong policymakers at the Fed, but my views are my own and not necessarily those of\nthe Federal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\nEconomic Outlook\nLet me start with some general comments on the state of the economy as we enter\n2012. A year ago, most economists were forecasting that economic growth would be 3\n\n1\n\n\fpercent or a bit more in 2011. Instead, the latest numbers released last Friday showed\nthat real GDP in 2011 was 1.6 percent, compared to 3.1 percent in the prior year.\nSome of this weakness is perfectly understandable, given the shocks we experienced\nthroughout most of the year. Last year began with severe snowstorms in the East. As\n2011 progressed, there were the earthquake and ensuing disasters in Japan, followed by\nthe unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, which led to a run‐up in oil prices. In\naddition, there were renewed concerns about European sovereign debt and the\nmidsummer uproar in Washington over fiscal policy and the debt ceiling. All of these\nevents weighed heavily on growth, as well as on business and consumer confidence.\nYet, the economy persevered. Indeed, growth accelerated across each of the four\nquarters, from less than 0.5 percent in the first quarter to around 2‐3/4 percent in the\nfourth quarter. I anticipate that we will continue to see moderate growth of around 3\npercent for 2012 and 2013, which is slightly above trend.\nBusiness spending, especially investments in equipment and software, was relatively\nhealthy last year, buoyed by solid growth in corporate earnings. In January, the\nPhiladelphia Fed’s Business Outlook Survey showed that regional manufacturing activity\ncontinued to expand at a moderate pace, the fourth consecutive monthly increase since\na late summer lull. The survey’s measures of future activity also indicated that our\nrespondents expect activity to continue to pick up over the next six months. I take this\nas a sign that business sentiment is also improving.\nOn the housing front, I expect to see stabilization but not much improvement in 2012.\nWe entered the Great Recession over‐invested in residential real estate, and we are not\nlikely to see a housing recovery until the surplus inventory of foreclosed and distressed\nproperties declines. Even as the economy rebalances, we should not seek nor should\nwe expect housing and related sectors to return to those pre‐recession highs. Those\nexuberant days were simply not sustainable, and it would be a mistake to retain that\nstandard as our benchmark for recovery.\n2\n\n\fThe housing crash destroyed a great deal of wealth for the average consumer and the\neconomy as a whole. The losses are real and the consequences severe for many\nindividuals and many businesses. Moreover, the losses cannot be papered over with\nmonetary policy nor should it try to do so. Households and businesses, however,\ncontinue to make progress on restoring the health of their balance sheets by paying\ndown debt and increasing savings. Most economists, including myself, believe that this\nprocess will continue into 2012. But the drag on growth from this rebalancing will\ngradually lessen over time.\nWhile there is a long way to go in restoring a vibrant labor market, I am encouraged by\nthe employment reports released over the past several months. The December\nemployment report showed a net gain of 200,000 jobs and a decline in the\nunemployment rate to 8.5 percent. The economy added over 1.6 million jobs during\n2011, and the unemployment rate fell nearly a full percentage point. Interestingly, the\nlast time the unemployment rate fell by this much in one year was in 1995. As growth\ncontinues and strengthens, I expect further gradual declines in the unemployment rate,\nwith the rate falling to around 8 percent or a little less, by the end of 2012.\nOf course, forecasting is a hazardous business, even in the best of times, and we should\nall take any economic forecast with at least a grain or two of salt – if not more. So it is\nimportant to recognize that there are some obvious risks to the growth forecast. The\nlargest of these are the ramifications for the U.S. economy of the continuing sovereign\ndebt crisis in Europe. An economic slowdown in the euro zone will likely restrain U.S.\nexports. And while strains in financial markets have been limited to European\ninstitutions so far, the situation bears watching to ensure that there are no adverse\nspillovers to U.S. financial institutions. Of course, regardless of how the European\nsituation plays out, it has already imposed considerable uncertainty on growth\nprospects for the global economy.\nThat uncertainty has been compounded by our own nation’s inability to establish a clear\nplan to put our fiscal policy on a sustainable path. Until the economic environment\n3\n\n\fbecomes clearer, firms and consumers are likely to postpone significant spending and\nhiring decisions – posing a drag on the recovery, even as economic developments in the\nU.S. continue to improve.\nJust as growth was weaker in 2011 than many forecasters had anticipated, inflation was\nhigher. A year ago, many were concerned about the risks of a sustained deflation. I was\nnot among them. Instead, I thought we would see inflation at about 2 percent for the\nyear.\nIt turns out we were all wrong. Total inflation in 2011, as measured by the CPI on a\nyear‐over‐year basis, was 3 percent, reflecting strong increases in energy and food\nprices, particularly in the early part of the year. Core inflation, which excludes food and\nenergy prices, rose to about 2.2 percent. I anticipate, however, that with many\ncommodity prices now leveling off or falling, and inflation expectations relatively stable,\ninflation will moderate in the near term. Indeed, total inflation has been more subdued\nover the past several months.\nAs a policymaker, though, I focus less on the near term and more on the medium term.\nGiven the very accommodative monetary policy that has been in place for more than\nthree years, I believe we must continue to monitor inflation measures very carefully.\nInflation most often develops gradually, and if monetary policy waits too long to\nrespond, it can be very costly to correct. Measures of slack such as the unemployment\nrate are often thought to prevent inflation from rising. But that did not turn out to be\ntrue in the 1970s. Thus, we need to proceed with caution as to the degree of monetary\naccommodation we supply to the economy. So let me review some of the policy actions\nthe Fed has taken.\nMonetary Policy\nAs you know, the Fed has kept the federal funds rate near zero for more than three\nyears to support the recovery. We have also conducted two rounds of asset purchases\n4\n\n\fthat have more than tripled the size of the balance sheet and changed its composition\nfrom short‐term Treasuries to longer‐term Treasuries and housing‐related securities,\nmostly mortgage‐backed securities.\nIn the most recent meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee announced that\neconomic conditions were “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal\nfunds rate at least through late 2014” – that’s almost three years from now. Last August\nwhen the FOMC first signaled a time frame for continued low rates, it was until mid‐\n2013. So our announcement last week lengthened the period of anticipated very low\nrates by 18 months. In addition, the Committee announced that the Fed intends to\ncontinue the maturity extension program, or “operation twist,” first launched last\nSeptember. In this program, to be completed by the end of June, the Fed is buying $400\nbillion of longer‐term Treasuries and selling an equal amount of shorter‐term Treasuries,\nin an effort to reduce yields from already historically low levels. The FOMC is also\ncontinuing to reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and MBS into\nMBS in an effort to help mortgage markets.\nYou may know that I dissented from the FOMC decisions in August and September\nbecause it was not clear to me that further monetary policy accommodation was\nappropriate. After all, inflation was higher and unemployment was lower relative to the\nprevious year. Moreover, policy actions are never free; they need to be evaluated\nbased on a thorough analysis of costs and benefits. I believed that the benefits of\nfurther monetary policy easing were small at best, since, in my view, they would do little\nto help resolve the challenges we face on the employment front. But the potential costs\nof this further accommodation could translate into a steady rise in inflation over the\nmedium term, even without much of a drop in the unemployment rate. In my\nassessment, the potential costs of further accommodation outweighed the potential\nbenefits.\nFor similar reasons, I was not supportive of the most recent decision to extend the time\nframe for exceptionally low rates through 2014. In my view, economic conditions have\n5\n\n\fmodestly improved since our December meeting, especially on the employment front,\nand the downside risk of a double‐dip recession that many feared in September when\nthe Committee instituted “operation twist” has substantially abated. Thus, with the\neconomy gradually improving, I saw little justification to further ease monetary policy\nand felt it risked undermining confidence in the process.\nIn addition, I don’t support the practice of offering forward policy guidance by saying\neconomic conditions are likely to lead to low rates through some calendar date. Such\nstatements are, in my mind, particularly problematic from a communications\nperspective. Monetary policy should be contingent on the economic environment and\nnot on the calendar. For example, I often read comments in the media that the FOMC\nhas “pledged” or “vowed” to keep rates at zero at least until late 2014. But this is\nclearly incorrect. The FOMC has made no such commitment and the statement\nindicates as much – if economic conditions change, then so will policy. Yet there\ncontinues to be confusion and the confusion stems from our statement. In my view,\nthere are much better ways to communicate information about the future path of policy\nthan the use of calendar dates. Indeed, one of these ways was provided in January\nwhen we began providing information on the policy paths that underlie FOMC\nparticipants’ forecasts.\nImproving Communications\nSo let me turn to our communication initiatives, which have received a fair amount of\nattention in the financial press. Improving the transparency of monetary policy has\nalways been high on my list of things to do since joining the Federal Reserve Bank of\nPhiladelphia in 2006. The Federal Reserve is accountable to the public, so it needs to\nclearly communicate its goals and its approach to making policy decisions.\nTo its credit, the Federal Reserve has strived to increase transparency about its actions\nand its policies, particularly during the tenure of Chairman Ben Bernanke. For instance,\n\n6\n\n\fin an effort to improve its communications to the public, the FOMC decided in 2007 to\nrelease its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, four times a year.\nIn 2011, Chairman Bernanke introduced press briefings to provide additional context for\nthe FOMC's policy decisions following the release of the SEP. However, until now, these\nreleases did not include any information about the assumptions policymakers made\nabout the path of monetary policy. Therefore, it was difficult for the public to interpret\nthe projections for growth, employment, and inflation.\nEarly last summer, Chairman Bernanke asked Governor Yellen, Governor Raskin,\nPresident Evans, and me to serve on a communications subcommittee. In January, the\nFOMC adopted two initiatives brought forward by the subcommittee. Both initiatives\nare important steps forward for the FOMC and are intended to serve the Committee\nand the public over the longer term.\nThe first concerned improving our communications about FOMC participants’ economic\nprojections in the SEP. So starting with our last meeting, the expanded SEP now\ncontains information about policymakers’ assumed path for monetary policy, along with\nthe projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation. It is important to keep in\nmind that the Fed’s SEP projections differ from those of private‐sector forecasters.\nPrivate‐sector forecasters explicitly or implicitly try to predict what the Fed’s next move\nwill be. In the SEP, each policymaker assumes a path for monetary policy that – based\non current economic conditions – he or she believes will deliver the best outcomes for\nthe economy.\nProviding policy projections in the SEP helps the public to interpret the economic\nforecasts included in the SEP. For example, FOMC participants might have considerably\ndifferent growth forecasts. Is it because they have different views about the underlying\ndynamics of the economy? Or is it because they are assuming different policy paths?\nAlternatively, two participants may have similar forecasts – say, the same inflation\nforecast – but they may believe that these forecasts will be achieved through different\n7\n\n\fpolicy paths. The expanded SEP will now show the range of views about the assumed\npolicy paths that give rise to the projections.\nOf course, over time, policymakers’ views will evolve as the economy evolves. So, the\nexpanded SEP will add an important perspective not just of prospective policy at a point\nin time, but of how the policy projections are influenced as economic conditions change.\nI would argue that adding policymakers’ assumptions to the SEP conveys more useful\ninformation about the likely future path of monetary policy than using a calendar date\nas we have been doing. It has two main advantages in my view. First, it illustrates the\nfull range of views and, in doing so, underlines the uncertainty that truly exists about\nfuture policy. Second, over time it will reveal more information about the reaction\nfunction of policymakers’ views of policy to the evolution of economic conditions, which\nare, after all, the ultimate drivers of policy decisions. Such communication will prove\nuseful not only in periods such as the current unusual circumstances but in more normal\ntimes as well.\nThe second important communications initiative adopted by the FOMC in January was\nto issue a consensus statement of the longer‐run goals and policy strategy.\nWhen households, firms, and markets have a better understanding of what to expect\nfrom monetary policy, they can make better financial plans and spending decisions.\nThus, greater clarity helps monetary policy become more effective at promoting its\ncongressionally mandated goals of price stability, maximum employment, and moderate\nlong‐term interest rates.\nThe consensus statement does three very important things never before undertaken by\nthe Federal Reserve. First, the FOMC explicitly states its goal for inflation as 2 percent,\nas measured by the year‐over‐year change in the overall personal consumption\nexpenditures (PCE) chain‐weighted price index. Being explicit about our inflation\nobjective will enhance the credibility of our commitment to price stability, which will\nhelp anchor inflation expectations and foster price stability and moderate long‐term\n8\n\n\finterest rates. Moreover, a credible commitment to price stability affords the Fed more\nflexibility in the short run as it attempts to mitigate the fluctuations in output and\nemployment in the face of significant economic disturbances.\nSecond, the statement explains why the FOMC cannot set a fixed long‐run numerical\nobjective for the employment part of our mandate. This is not because we do not seek\nmaximum employment or because we want to disregard or downplay its importance.\nRather, it reflects the differences between the economic determinants of the inflation\nand employment parts of our mandate. Over the longer run, the economy’s inflation\nrate is primarily determined by monetary policy. So, the FOMC is able to set a longer‐\nrun numerical goal for inflation and should be held accountable for achieving that goal.\nOn the other hand, maximum employment is largely determined by factors that are\nbeyond the direct control of monetary policy. These factors include such things as\ndemographics, technological innovation, the structure of the labor market, and various\ngovernmental policies – all of which will vary over time. Policymakers consider a wide\nrange of indicators in assessing employment, but estimates of maximum employment at\nany point in time are subject to substantial uncertainty. The FOMC cannot set a fixed\nnumerical objective for something that it does not directly control and cannot\naccurately measure.\nA third element of the consensus statement is that it makes clear that the FOMC takes a\nbalanced approach to setting policy. By balanced approach I mean one that promotes\nall of our congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment, stable prices,\nand moderate long‐term interest rates and does not favor one over the other.\nThe consensus statement does not provide answers for all the hard policy choices. How\nbest to implement this balanced approach takes a lot of judgment and may well differ\nacross policymakers who may have different models of the economy even as they work\nto promote the same long‐term goals for monetary policy.\n\n9\n\n\fConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth to gradually accelerate to around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, with job growth strengthening and\nthe unemployment rate falling gradually over time. I believe inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and inflation will moderate in the near term. However, with the very\naccommodative stance of monetary policy, the inflation situation is one that bears\ncareful watching in order to ensure that inflation pressures remain contained over the\nmedium run.\nOn monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has taken bold and significant steps to improve\nthe transparency of its policy actions and to create better public understanding of the\nrationale behind the FOMC’s decisions. Specifically, the FOMC now includes\ninformation about each participant’s assessments for the target federal funds rate path\nin its Summary of Economic Projections. The FOMC has also clarified its longer‐run goals\nand monetary policy decision‐making process and clearly articulated its inflation\nobjective.\nEconomic research over the past 30 years has shown that setting monetary policy in a\nsystematic manner leads to better economic outcomes — lower and less volatile\ninflation and greater economic stability in general. But the benefit depends on the\npublic’s understanding of the policymaking framework. Transparency not only furthers\nthe effectiveness of monetary policy by enhancing the credibility of the central bank but\nalso raises the Fed’s accountability to the public. Thus, I remain committed to working\nto increase the clarity of the Fed’s public communications about current economic\nconditions, the economic outlook, and our policymaking framework.\n\n10\n\n\f"

Plosser\nPresident and CEO\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nThe views expressed today are my own and not necessarily\nthose of the Federal Reserve System or the FOMC.\n\n\fEconomic Prospects and Monetary Policy for the New Year\n33rd Annual Economic Seminar\nRochester, NY\nJanuary 11, 2012\nCharles I. Plosser\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\n\nIntroduction\nThank you for inviting me back to participate in this 33rd annual economic seminar. The\nSimon School began holding this event soon after I began teaching here, and it is a\npleasure to return and share my thoughts about the economy. Providing an economic\noutlook for the same event for the past 33 years is both an honor and a challenge. As I\nhave noted on many occasions, forecasting can be a humbling exercise in the best of\ntimes. For better or worse, my speeches at this event allow for a longitudinal study of\nthe accuracy of my forecasts. I am not going to bore you with the results of that study,\nexcept to say that they do underscore the need for humility when forecasting.\nDespite the challenges, policymakers, like business leaders, really have very little\nalternative than to continue to forecast. By its nature, monetary policy must be\nforward‐looking, since the actions taken today may not have their full effects for a year\nor more into the future. Monetary policymakers provide forecasts as a context for how\nthey set monetary policy.\nSo, today, I will venture forth once again to offer my perspective on the outlook for the\neconomy. I will also provide some thoughts about the ways policymakers can improve\ntheir communications about monetary policy.\nOf course, I should note that my views are my own and not necessarily those of the\nFederal Reserve Board or my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\n1\n\n\fEconomic Outlook\nDespite past challenges, I remain optimistic about the economy’s future. In part, my\noptimism arises from my belief in the fundamental resiliency of our market economy.\nAlthough I’m optimistic, I’m also realistic. I know that in the past year, the U.S. economy\nhas failed to live up to the expectations of growth that I and many economists had at\nthe beginning of 2011. A year ago most economists were forecasting that economic\ngrowth would be 3 percent or a bit more in 2011. Instead, growth is likely to turn out to\nbe less than 2 percent.\nSome of this weakness is perfectly understandable given the shocks we experienced.\nShortly after the start of 2011, we had severe snowstorms in the East, then the\nearthquake and ensuing disasters in Japan, followed by the unrest in the Middle East\nand North Africa that led to a run‐up in oil prices. In addition, there were renewed\nconcerns about European sovereign debt, and our own fracas in Washington over fiscal\npolicy and the debt ceiling. All of these events weighed heavily on growth, as well as on\nbusiness and consumer confidence.\nNonetheless, neither I nor other forecasters see much chance that the U.S. economy will\nslip into another recession in the coming year. Real GDP in the U.S. has been growing —\nalbeit modestly — for nine straight quarters. I anticipate that we will continue to see\nmodest growth of around 3 percent for 2012 and 2013.\nRealistically, though, downside risks certainly remain. The largest of these are the\nramifications for the U.S. economy of the continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe. An\neconomic slowdown in the euro zone will likely restrain export growth in the U.S. And\nwhile strains in financial markets have been limited to European institutions so far, the\nsituation bears watching to ensure that there are no adverse spillovers to U.S. financial\ninstitutions. Of course, regardless of how the European situation plays out, it has\nalready imposed additional uncertainty on growth prospects for the global economy.\n\n2\n\n\fThat uncertainty has been compounded by our own nation’s inability to establish a clear\nplan to put our fiscal policy on a sustainable path. Until the economic environment\nbecomes clearer, firms and consumers are likely to postpone significant spending and\nhiring decisions ‐‐ posing a drag on the recovery, even as economic developments in the\nU.S. continue to improve.\nIn addition to the effects of uncertainty, consumers face the ongoing work of restoring\nthe health of their balance sheets. The fall in both home prices and the stock market\nmarkedly reduced household wealth. The natural response to such a decrease is for\nfamilies to reduce consumption and increase saving, and that is exactly what we are\nseeing. Most economists believe that this process will take a while longer before\nconsumers resume more normal spending and saving patterns.\nBusinesses, on the other hand, seem further along in improving their balance sheets’\nhealth and improving productivity. Business investment on equipment and software has\nbeen relatively strong, buoyed by solid growth in corporate earnings. The Philadelphia\nFed’s Business Outlook Survey and other regional measures of manufacturing activity\nhave improved since late summer, and the forward‐looking components of these\nsurveys suggest continuing growth into 2012.\nOn the housing front, I expect to see stabilization but not much improvement in 2012.\nWe entered the Great Recession over‐invested in residential real estate, and we are not\nlikely to see a housing recovery until the surplus inventory of foreclosed and distressed\nproperties declines. As the economy rebalances, we may not see housing and related\nsectors return to those pre‐recession highs, nor should we necessarily seek or expect\nthem to do so.\nThe health of the labor market continues to be a major concern. Unemployment\nremains uncomfortably high, putting strains on millions of families and individuals.\nWhile there is a long way to go in restoring a vibrant labor market, I am encouraged by\nthe employment reports released over the past several months.\n3\n\n\fLast Friday’s report showed a net gain of 200,000 jobs in December and another drop in\nthe unemployment rate to 8.5 percent. This means that in 2011 the economy added\nover 1.6 million jobs and the unemployment rate fell nearly a full percentage point.\nWhile the road may not be a smooth one, it is encouraging that we are continuing to see\na gradual improvement in labor market conditions.\nAs growth continues and strengthens, I expect further modest declines in the\nunemployment rate to around 8 percent or, in my more optimistic moments, maybe a\nlittle less, by the end of 2012.\nJust as growth has been weaker than many forecasters had anticipated, inflation has\nbeen higher than many expected in 2011. When we last met a year ago, many were\nconcerned about the risks of a sustained deflation. I was not among them. Instead, I\nthought we would see inflation at about 2 percent for the year.\nIt turns out we were all wrong. Total inflation, as measured by the CPI on a year‐over‐\nyear basis, is nearly 3‐1/2 percent, reflecting strong increases in energy and food prices\nin the past year. Core inflation, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, is\nrunning at about 2.2 percent. I do anticipate that with many commodity prices now\nleveling off or falling, and inflation expectations relatively stable, inflation will moderate\nin the near term. Indeed, total inflation has moderated over the past several months.\nBut as a policymaker, my focus is less on the near term and more on the medium term.\nLooking further ahead, I believe we must monitor the inflation situation very carefully,\nparticularly in this environment of very accommodative monetary policy. Inflation most\noften develops gradually, and if monetary policy waits too long to respond, it can be\nvery costly to correct. Measures of slack such as the unemployment rate are often\nthought to prevent inflation from rising. But that did not turn out to be true in the\n1970s. Thus, we need to proceed with caution as to the degree of monetary\naccommodation we supply to the economy. So let me review some of the policy actions\nthe Fed has taken.\n4\n\n\fMonetary Policy\nAn environment of extraordinary monetary accommodation has supported the\nrecovery, with the federal funds rate near zero for over three years. In the meantime,\nthe Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has more than tripled as the Fed enacted programs\nto improve liquidity in a weak economy and to shift its asset composition from short‐\nterm Treasuries to longer‐term Treasuries, mortgage‐backed securities (MBS), and\nagency debt.\nLast August, the Federal Open Market Committee changed its guidance about its\nexpectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, stating that economic\nconditions were “likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at\nleast through mid‐2013.”\nIn September, the Committee announced its intention to purchase $400 billion of\nlonger‐term Treasuries and to sell an equal amount of shorter‐term Treasuries in an\neffort to reduce yields from already historically low levels. This action, to be completed\nby June, will lengthen the maturity of the Fed’s asset holdings. In addition, in an effort\nto help mortgage markets, the FOMC is reinvesting principal payments from its holdings\nof agency debt and MBS into MBS rather than Treasuries.\nIf you happen to follow the Fed’s policy actions, you may know that I dissented from\nthese decisions. Let me briefly explain why. Given the economic developments in\nAugust and September and the economic outlook, it was not clear to me that further\nmonetary policy accommodation was appropriate. After all, inflation was higher and\nunemployment was lower relative to the previous year. Moreover, policy actions are\nnever free; they need to be evaluated based on a thorough analysis of costs and\nbenefits. I felt that the benefits of further monetary policy actions were small at best,\nsince, in my view, they would do little to help resolve the challenges on the employment\nfront. But further monetary policy accommodation carried potential costs. It could\ntranslate into a steady rise in inflation over the medium term even without much of a\n5\n\n\fdrop in the unemployment rate. We saw such an environment of stagflation in the\n1970s, and we must remain vigilant that we do not create such a situation again. In my\nassessment, the potential costs outweighed the potential benefits of further\naccommodation.\nIn addition, the August decision to change the forward policy guidance by saying\neconomic conditions were likely to lead to low rates through mid‐2013 raised\nparticularly difficult communication challenges. First, given my outlook, I believe\neconomic conditions may require the Fed to raise rates before mid‐2013. Second,\nmonetary policy should be contingent on the economic environment and not on the\ncalendar. In my view, making a perceived commitment based on calendar time risks\nconfusing the public about how policy is formed. If the Committee wishes to provide\nforward guidance, then a better way of conveying such information is necessary. My\nown view is that it would be better to provide more information about how policy\nresponds to economic events, a sort of reaction function, than to make commitments\nbased on the calendar that we may not keep.\nImproving Communications\nIn fact, my FOMC colleagues and I have been discussing for some time how to improve\ncommunications about policymakers’ views of current economic conditions, the\neconomic outlook, and our framework for making monetary policy decisions. Early last\nsummer, Chairman Bernanke asked Governor Yellen, Governor Raskin, President Evans,\nand me to serve on a communications subcommittee. As the minutes from the\nDecember FOMC meeting indicate, the Committee discussed two communications\ninitiatives brought forward by the subcommittee. The first concerned improving our\ncommunications about FOMC participants’ economic projections. The second\nconcerned the development of a consensus statement on the FOMC’s longer‐run goals\nand monetary policy strategy.\n\n6\n\n\fMaking longer‐term goals transparent is important, not just for central banks but for any\norganization. As that master of the understatement Yogi Berra is said to have\nremarked:\n\"You've got to be careful if you don't know where you're going ‘cause you might not get\nthere!\"\nImproving the transparency of monetary policy has always been high on my list of things\nto do. The Fed is accountable to the public, so it needs to be clear about its goals and\napproach to making policy decisions. Moreover, when households, firms, and markets\nhave a better understanding of what to expect from monetary policy, they can make\nbetter financial plans and spending decisions. Thus, greater clarity helps monetary\npolicy become more effective at promoting its congressionally mandated goals of price\nstability, maximum employment, and moderate long‐term interest rates.\nThe Fed, particularly during the tenure of Chairman Bernanke, has become increasingly\ntransparent in its policies and actions. In 2007, the FOMC decided to release its\nSummary of Economic Projections, or SEP for short, four times a year. These projections\nprovide information about the range of individual policymakers’ forecasts for key\neconomic variables, including output, inflation, and unemployment. But these forecasts\ndiffer from the kind made by private‐sector economists who try to predict what the\npolicy path will be. Instead, in making the SEP projections, each policymaker assumes a\npath for monetary policy that – based on current economic conditions — he or she\nbelieves will deliver the best outcomes for the economy. Yet, up to now, the SEP did\nnot include any information on those policy projections. This lack of information makes\nit harder for the public to interpret the projections. For example, two FOMC\nparticipants might have considerably different growth forecasts. Is this because they\nhave different views about the underlying dynamics of the economy? Or is it because\nthey are assuming different policy paths? Alternatively, two participants may have\nsimilar forecasts, but they may believe that these forecasts will be achieved through\ndifferent policy paths. Without any information about the assumed policy paths, it is\n7\n\n\fharder to judge the meaning of differences or similarities of forecasts across FOMC\nparticipants. So to help alleviate some of this uncertainty, starting in January, the SEP\nwill provide information on participants’ assessments about the appropriate path of\nmonetary policy.\nAs I indicated in a speech last November, I fully support this move toward increased\ntransparency. In my view, giving the public a sense of Committee participants’ views on\nappropriate policy in the SEP conveys much more useful information about the likely\nfuture path of policy than using a calendar date, as we have been doing in our recent\nFOMC policy statements. Of course, the views of appropriate policy will vary across\nparticipants. But that diversity will help convey a sense of the confidence bands around\nthe assessments, which I consider a plus as well.\nThese policy projections are not unconditional commitments of the Committee. The\nviews of appropriate policy will evolve over time as economic and financial conditions\nchange. As the policy assessments change, the relationship between current economic\nconditions, the economic outlook, and appropriate policy will become more\ntransparent. This will give the public a better understanding of our policy reaction\nfunction – that is, about how we are likely to adjust policy in response to changes in\neconomic conditions.\nAs the minutes of the December FOMC meeting indicate, FOMC participants continue to\ndiscuss ways to clarify the Fed’s longer‐run goals and monetary policy decision‐making\nprocess. Let me explain what, in my view, are three essential elements in such a\nclarification. First, the FOMC should provide an explicit numerical inflation objective.\nBeing explicit will enhance the credibility of our commitment to price stability, which\nwill help anchor inflation expectations and foster price stability and moderate long‐term\ninterest rates. Moreover, a credible commitment to price stability affords the Fed more\nflexibility in the short run as it attempts to mitigate the fluctuations in output and\nemployment in the face of significant economic disturbances.\n\n8\n\n\fSecond, in my view a clarification of our monetary policy objectives and strategy should\nexplain why the FOMC cannot set a fixed long‐run numerical objective for the\nemployment part of our mandate. Let me be very clear – this does not mean that I do\nnot care about maximum employment or want to disregard or downgrade its\nimportance. Rather, it reflects the economic differences between the inflation and\nemployment parts of our mandate. Over the longer run, the economy’s inflation rate is\nmainly determined by monetary policy. So, the FOMC is able to set a longer‐run\nnumerical goal for inflation and should be held accountable for achieving that goal.\nIn contrast, maximum employment is largely determined by factors that are beyond the\ndirect control of monetary policy. These factors include such things as demographics,\ntechnological innovation, the structure of the labor market, and various governmental\npolicies – all of which will vary over time. Policymakers consider a wide range of\nindicators in assessing employment, but estimates of maximum employment are subject\nto substantial uncertainty. I do not believe the FOMC should set a fixed numerical\nobjective for something that it does not directly control and cannot accurately measure.\nA third element the FOMC should clarify is that it takes a balanced approach to setting\npolicy. By balanced approach I mean one that promotes all of our congressionally\nmandated objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long‐term\ninterest rates. In particular, the Committee’s policy judgments will seek to mitigate\nfluctuations in employment and inflation in the face of significant economic\ndisturbances.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the U.S. economy is continuing to grow at a moderate pace. I expect\nannual growth to gradually accelerate to around 3 percent in 2012 and 2013.\nProspects for labor markets will continue to improve, with job growth strengthening and\nthe unemployment rate falling gradually over time. I believe inflation expectations will\nbe relatively stable and inflation will moderate in the near term. However, with the very\n9\n\n\faccommodative stance of monetary policy, the inflation situation is one that bears\ncareful watching in order to ensure that inflation pressures remain contained over the\nmedium run.\nUncertainty imposed by the fiscal situation in Europe and the longer‐run fiscal issues in\nthe U.S. pose risks to the forecast. However, despite these risks, my baseline forecast is\nfor the U.S. recovery to continue.\nOn the monetary policy front, the Federal Reserve remains committed to enhancing the\ntransparency of its policy actions and creating better public understanding of the\nrationale behind the FOMC’s decisions. For this reason, later this month the FOMC will\nbegin to include information about each participant’s assessments for the target federal\nfunds rate path in its Summary of Economic Projections. The FOMC is exploring further\nenhancements to increase transparency and the effectiveness of its communications,\nincluding ways to clarify its longer‐run goals and monetary policy decision‐making\nprocess.\nEconomic research over the past 30 years has shown that setting monetary policy in a\nsystematic manner leads to better economic outcomes — lower and less volatile\ninflation and greater economic stability in general. But the benefit depends on the\npublic’s understanding of the policymaking framework. Transparency not only furthers\nthe effectiveness of monetary policy by enhancing the credibility of the central bank but\nalso raises the Fed’s accountability to the public. Thus, I remain committed to working\nto raise the clarity of the Fed’s public communications about current economic\nconditions, the economic outlook, and our policymaking framework.\n\n10\n\n\f"
