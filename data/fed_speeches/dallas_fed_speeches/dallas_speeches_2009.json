        "content": "December 8, 2009 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Barry [Mayer].\n\nThere are many distinguished Texans in this room. I would like to single out one of them: my daughter, Alison. I am very proud of her. She inherited her mother’s brains and graduated with honors in English literature from Harvard, where she was president of the Seneca, one of the largest women’s service organizations on the Harvard campus. Alison is now a graduate student at UT–Austin, in her second year at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. She is not only smart and strong and beautiful, but she is tolerant—so much so, she is even willing to sit through one of her father’s speeches. I am thrilled she is here.\n\nEducation is something I hold dear to my heart. It changed my life. Neither of my parents—Alison’s paternal grandparents—was formally educated. My father never made it past fourth grade. In lieu of middle school and high school, he swept floors under the lathes at a metalworking factory in Australia. My mother, a stern Norwegian raised in South Africa, attended the equivalent of a secretarial high school. They wanted better for me. Among the many fond memories I have of my mother, God rest her soul, two came to mind as I prepared this little sermon for today. The first was our twice-monthly trek when I was 12 to a local store to get the latest installment of the Golden Book Encyclopedia—these were the only books we could readily afford in our household at the time. Golden Books issued one volume per letter of the alphabet, and she insisted I read it cover to cover in order to “earn” the next volume. The second was her admonition that I had “better do well in school and learn to love to learn” because, in her stern words, “you can’t expect to get by in America just relying on your looks or your athletic ability.”\n\nIn his introduction, Barry listed all those great schools I was lucky to attend and all the fancy jobs I’ve had—shorthand in our resume-driven society for “he’s done all right.” All that can be traced back to a determined mother and the Golden Book Encyclopedia, as well as some inspirational teachers in primary and secondary school and a pragmatic father. When I got my M.B.A. from Stanford, my dad pulled me aside and said: “Enough already. In one generation, we’ve gone from no education to too much! Now get a job and go to work!”\n\nI have a job to do today, so I better go to work speaking on the topic you asked me here for: the subject of education.\n\nThe benefits we derive from the books and the buildings and the teachers and tutors that form the building blocks of our educational society don’t stop at the classroom door. They spread outward, affecting our lives and the lives of others around us in innumerable ways. Today I am going to speak from the perspective of the economy and living standards, a principal preoccupation of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere are countless studies in the economics literature that highlight the links between increases in educational levels and economic productivity and improvements in society’s welfare. Employment is significantly higher among the more educated. Workers with a college degree experience lower fluctuations in employment and, if they do lose their jobs in tough times such as these, do so at a lower rate than their less-educated peers and are more likely to find new jobs.\n\nThe simple fact is you earn what you learn. Education pays off. We can see this in the wage data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year, the average hourly wage in Texas was $18.90. In the same period, the average hourly wage in Texas for internal medicine doctors was $77.22, $42.67 for geological engineers, $43.50 for computer engineers and $29.70 for nurses. The more you learn, the more you earn.\n\nIn 1980, a college degree would earn you about 50 percent more than a high school diploma. In 1990, that differential jumped to 73 percent and, in 2000, to 85 percent. Today, someone who holds a college degree earns 97 percent more than his or her classmate who went no further than high school.\n\nYou earn what you learn. Higher education is the key to improved earnings and social prosperity.\n\nThis is no great mystery. We make our living as Americans less with our muscles than we do with our brains. At the beginning of the 20th century, when my parents were born, 37 percent of the U.S. workforce was employed in agriculture. Today, in Alison’s world, agricultural output represents less than 2 percent of our gross domestic product and employs just over 1 percent of our workers. In 1900, 38 percent of our labor force worked in “industry,” a broad category that includes manufacturing, construction and mining. Today, manufacturing employs 10 percent of our workforce, and mining—less than 1 percent.\n\nThe delivery of services has replaced ag and manufacturing and mining and oil and gas and is the engine of our growth. At the beginning of the 20th century, 26 percent of our workforce was employed in services. Today that number is about 80 percent. We are a service-driven economy. Winston Churchill used to refer in his speeches to the “superfine processes” that added value to basic raw material inputs in the era when Britannia ruled the waves of the Manufacturing Age economy. Today, we live at an ever-higher end of the value-added spectrum, with education being the stuff of our economic success.\n\nWe have the most efficient services workers in the world. Contrary to popular belief, we sell those services not just at home, but around the globe. Sales of things like computer and information services, research and development, accounting and auditing, and management and consulting earn us substantial foreign income—so much so that while we run a deficit in our trade in goods with the rest of the world, we run a surplus in our trade in services. It trims our overall trade deficit some 20 percent from what it would otherwise be.\n\nEven lawyers make money abroad. Imagine that! Our exports of legal services in 2008 were four times our imports. In the same year, exports in advertising, finance, medical services and education exceeded our imports in these categories by a factor of three. And thanks to Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and Angelina Jolie and Jessica Simpson—and, indeed, despite Sunday night’s ignominious defeat, Jessica’s ex, Tony Romo—our foreign distribution of films, TV shows, performing arts and sports programming and products are in such tremendous demand abroad that their overseas sales exceed our imports by a factor of seven.\n\nThe point is this: The fields and factories that powered the economy of yesterday remain important in the United States and in Texas. But more important in the current economy and to our economic future is the production of high-value-added services. As some have previously noted, in the world of “superfine processes” of the Knowledge Age, digits are the new widgets. The brain is to the Knowledge Age and the mastery of digits what the engine was to the Manufacturing Age and the management of widgets. Education is the steam and the oil and the gas that propel that engine. The speed at which we move our economy forward from this point onward will depend on how well we educate our children. We cannot produce the skilled labor needed to advance this economy without a top-notch educational system—one that relentlessly pushes America farther up the value-added ladder while the Chinese and the Indians and others scurry up the lower rungs of that ladder with their billions of eager workers and ever-more agile grasp of the most basic tools of technology.\n\nAs I understand this conference, you all are here to “grade [your] own paper”—to assess your efforts to create a top-notch educational system here in this great city and state.\n\nGene [Austin], you wrote a comprehensive piece on this subject just last month in the Austin American-Statesman. I agree that many efforts undertaken at the state and local levels—like the “20,010 by 2010” initiative—are producing real results. But we cannot declare victory yet. We have many, many miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPersonally, I will not sleep until we get our higher education house in order. For a state as great as Texas, we are woefully lacking in tier-one universities.\n\nI want you to consider the following. It is fashionable in economic and financial circles to talk about the “BRIC” nations: Brazil and Russia, India and China. Yet, in the second quarter of this year, Texas produced more than two of those four countries did: more than Russia and more than India. And we were not all that far behind Brazil. You heard me correctly. The 24 million people of the Lone Star State, in the second quarter of this year, produced more in dollar-denominated economic output than the 1.1 billion people of India or the 140 million of Russia, at then-current exchange rates, and about 81 percent of what Brazil produced with half of South America’s population and just under half of South America’s land mass.\n\nTexas is a global economic power, surpassed in the United States only by California. So far, so good. But as you look into the future of the Knowledge Age and contemplate the ambition of the BRIC countries and others that will compete with us for a piece of the global economic pie, the picture darkens.\n\nConsider this: Texas has six major public university systems. The University of Texas System, whose home is right here in Austin, is the granddaddy of them all, with just under 200,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M System has 11 universities with 100,000-plus students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are each independent public universities. Together, these institutions house over 530,000 students.\n\nBy contrast, California has more than 650,000 students enrolled at just 33 public campuses. The granddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 220,000 students spread over 10 universities.\n\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the University of California System? Not one of you. That is because you know that in addition to Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Irvine, UC–Davis and UC–Santa Barbara. All that before you take into account Stanford, USC, Caltech and the Claremont Colleges.\n\nNow here is a fact we must face up to. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA, UC–San Diego, UC–Davis, UC–Santa Barbara and UC–Irvine all outranked our beloved UT–Austin—which placed 47th—for overall educational excellence. And the rest of our universities? The Aggies in College Station ranked 61st. The Mustangs of SMU ranked 68th, the Baylor Bears 80th and the Horned Frogs of TCU, 110th. The shining stars of our higher education galaxy are the appropriately named Owls of Rice, ranked 17th behind Johns Hopkins, tied with Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\n\nIt galls me that the “overtaxed, overregulated, left coast state” of California has within one fleet six universities that are ranked better than UT–Austin, our flagship. It bothers me to no end that we have only one university in our state that ranks in the top 20 in the nation.\n\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American Universities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S. schools garner about 57 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are home to 81 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas universities included in this prestigious group of 60.\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members, with four of those in the greater Los Angeles area alone. New York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.\n\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nThink about it. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about, a state that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as Boston. The Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex—my hometown—has … none. Think about that: The fourth-largest metropolitan district in America does not have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT–Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\n\nNow, how can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future in a fiercely competitive globalized world without a single elite university in Dallas? Or with only one in the great city of Houston? With a university ranked 47th in Austin? And with none of the top 50 in any other city in Texas? How can we expect Texas to continue to out-produce India and Russia and other hungry competitors and excel in the Knowledge Age—an era in which prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—with so few established fountainheads of advanced knowledge? How can we reasonably expect to prepare the youth of today—a group that I know you all care about, or else you would not have sacrificed your time to be here—if we aren’t providing them with top-notch preparation for the economy of tomorrow?\n\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Austin’s cityscape. When you travel to Dallas or Houston or any of our other great cities, look at their skylines. How many factories will you see? You won’t see any—at least none of the old-fashioned kind with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel buildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains. Brains that are employed in many of the high-value-added sectors I described earlier.\n\nWe need more of that brainpower, right here in River City. We need thousands upon thousands of the world’s best and brightest here in Texas, here in Austin, and in Houston and Dallas and Fort Worth and every nook and cranny of South and East and West Texas. We can fuel our economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in our community and its commitment to building our state and all the benefits it would bring to our arts and civic and educational communities, on top of the economic muscle it would add.\n\nLike everybody in this room, I swelled with pride when I watched Hunter Lawrence put that football through the uprights in the last second of Saturday night’s game at the “House that Jerry Built.” I delight in seeing TCU ranked among the nation’s top teams. As a former high school quarterback, I love dropping in on high school games on Friday nights. And whenever I lecture these days at our universities across the state, I can’t help but notice how handsome or beautiful the young men and women are in our classrooms.\n\nBut then I think back to my mother’s admonition: “You can’t expect to get by in America just relying on your looks or your athletic ability.” We can’t expect Texas to get by, let alone dominate, in a globalized economy where digits are the new widgets simply by relying on our good looks and athletic prowess.\n\nHere is the punch line: If you are willing to leave this room today accepting the fact that we have only two universities ranked in the top 50 in the nation and only one, Rice, in the top 20, then you are not the Texans I know and love. If you are willing to accept that the Longhorns of UT–Austin, mighty as they are, are outflanked on the educational battlefield by six campuses of the UC System, then I have severely overestimated your commitment to this great state of ours. If any of you are willing to accept that Guy Bailey at Texas Tech or David Daniel at the University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at SMU or Victor Boschini at TCU or Ricardo Romo at UT–San Antonio or Diana Natalicio at UTEP or Renu Khator at the University of Houston or Bowen Loftin at Texas A&M or William Powers here at UT–Austin is fighting with one hand tied behind his or her back because the powers-that-be here in the capital cannot rise to the cause and give to this state what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well, you, my friends, are suffering from a serious case of denial.\n\n“Denying” the people of Texas the tier-one universities they deserve presents a serious barrier to our future prosperity. We face many challenges head-on in this state. This is the biggest challenge of all. Face up to it, and get on with it. Thank you."

        "content": "November 19, 2009 Washington, D.C.\n\nSometimes it helps to contemplate economic predicaments by seeking wisdom from definitively noneconomic sources. Consider this passage from Book III of Milton’s Paradise Lost, where God answers the question of why He created men and angels who could rebel against Him. Of man, He responds:\n\nAs is clear from this most celebrated work of literature, the issue of whether entities—be they mortal or divine—should be allowed to fail is one of the oldest philosophical quandaries. It has been debated for eons on a much higher plane than economics or finance. And yet Milton is germane to the subject of this conference: “Restoring Global Financial Stability.” There is no way we can reasonably expect to restore global financial stability without addressing the vexing issue of institutions considered “too big to fail.”\n\nI shall focus my comments today on this issue. I do so very much as a Lone Ranger—perhaps what you might expect from a Texan. I am merely one of the 17 who currently sit at the table for policy deliberations on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I speak only for myself and the Dallas Fed and not for any other policymaker or division of the Federal Reserve.\n\nOnly a short while ago, we were teetering on the brink of global financial collapse. Essentially, what occurred was a crisis of unintended consequences: Misperceptions of risk and misplaced incentives led to misguided actions. The crisis metastasized in large financial institutions and spread through the entire body of the financial system. Both on and off balance sheets, banks levered up to cancerous levels and funneled funds into assets of questionable quality.\n\nThese bad bets were made worse by their scale and the rapidity with which they spread. It was not enough that one or two large institutions erroneously thought that real estate prices would rise forever—nearly all of the biggest banks did. It was not enough that one or two large institutions thought they could contract with third parties they presumed would immunize them against failure—nearly all did. And it was not enough that one or two regulators turned a blind eye to the systemic risk posed by this behavior—nearly all did, including the Federal Reserve.\n\nThis is not something new. Readers of history might recall Charles Mackay’s 1841 Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, in which he wrote:\n\nTo which he caustically added: “Men … think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds ...”\n\nOr they might note this from Walter Bagehot’s essay on Edward Gibbon in the National Review in 1856:\n\nOr Dickens’ bon mot, where he defined insurance as:\n\nHow different things might have been if financial actors had kept the most human instincts of “love of gain” and “necessity of excitement” from leading them to become accomplices to herd-like imitation and uninsurable speculation. This behavior begat a panic where, but for the intervention of the Federal Reserve and other central banks, the entire payments system froze and brought the world economy within a hair’s breadth of depression.\n\nHaving staved off the inevitable consequence of the pathology I have just summarized, it is high time to treat the most malignant of its perpetrators—financial institutions thought to be too big to fail—as we refashion, modernize and provide needed improvements to the regulatory system.\n\nDan Tarullo from the Federal Reserve Board recently put it this way: “… the regulatory system did not come close to adequately accounting for the impact of trading, securitization, and some other capital market activities on both traditional banking and systemic risk.… The need for a thorough overhaul of the financial regulatory system is thus borne out not only by our frighteningly close brush with financial collapse … but also by the degree to which too-big-to-fail perceptions and capital-market sources of systemic risk had been permitted—if not encouraged—by regulatory developments in the preceding decades.”[3]\n\nFrom the perspective of monetary policy, I view of paramount interest an overhaul of a system that has come to coddle such “too-big-to-fail perceptions and capital-market sources of systemic risk.” My colleague Harvey Rosenblum and I explained why in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal on September 28 in an essay titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.”\n\nWe noted that the very existence of the blob of banks considered as too big to fail blocks, or seriously undermines, the mechanisms through which monetary policy influences the economy.\n\nWhen the Fed encounters rising unemployment and slowing growth, it purchases short-term Treasury bonds, thus lowering interest rates and inducing banks to lend more and borrowers to spend more. The banking system, and the capital markets that respond to these same signals, are critical to transmitting Fed policy actions into changes in economic activity.\n\nThese links normally function fairly smoothly. Numerous academic studies have concluded that monetary policy before the financial crisis was working better, faster and more predictably than it did a few decades ago. Monetary policy’s increased effectiveness helped usher in a quarter century of unprecedented macroeconomic stability with infrequent and mild recessions and low inflation. This was perhaps the closest we have come to economic paradise.\n\nThen the Blob gummed up the works. With financial markets in trouble and the economy wobbling, the Fed began lowering its target interest rate two years ago, bringing it close to zero by December 2008. Other central banks followed suit. Based on recent experience, such aggressive policies should have returned our economy to the trajectory of stability and growth more quickly. Unfortunately, the Blob began blocking the channels monetary policy uses to influence the real economy.\n\nAs the financial crisis erupted, the largest banks, by capitalization and influence, saw their capital bases erode, and wary financial markets made them pay dearly for new capital to shore up their balance sheets.\n\nIn this environment, monetary policy’s interest-rate channel operated perversely. The real borrowing costs that matter most for the economy’s recovery—those paid by businesses and households—rose rather than fell. Those banks with the greatest toxic asset losses were the quickest to freeze or reduce their lending activity. Their borrowers faced higher interest rates and restricted access to funding when these banks raised their margins to ration the limited loans available or to reflect their own higher cost of funds as markets began to recognize the systemic risk posed by banks presumed to be too big to fail.\n\nThe credit channel also narrowed because undercapitalized banks, especially those writing off or recognizing massive losses, must shrink, not grow, their private-sector loans. Too-big-to-fail institutions account for more than half of the U.S. banking sector, and the industry is even more highly concentrated in the European Union. Small banks, most of them well capitalized, simply don’t have the capacity to offset shrinking lending activity of the behemoth banks. This problem is exacerbated by the procyclical nature of bank capital regulation, which operates on the implicit assumption that banks get into trouble one, or a couple, at a time. Bank capital regulation provides some microeconomic incentives, but destabilizing macroeconomic outcomes, when a large number of very large banks are simultaneously in trouble.\n\nThe balance-sheet channel depends on falling interest rates to push up the value of homes, stocks, bonds and other assets, creating a positive wealth effect that stimulates spending. When the financial crisis pushed interest rates and spreads perversely high, balance-sheet deleveraging took place instead, with households and businesses cutting their debt at a time when stimulative efforts were needed to prop up the macroeconomy.\n\nFalling interest rates, all else equal, usually nudge down the dollar’s value against other currencies, opening an exchange-rate channel for monetary policy that boosts exports and tempers imports. In the financial crisis, the dollar rose for about nine months relative to the euro and pound (but not the yen). This unusual behavior partly reflected higher interest rates and no doubt some “flight to quality” but probably had more to do with the perception that financial conditions at the very largest banks were worse in the U.K. and the rest of Europe than in the U.S.\n\nFinally, the troubles of mega-financial institutions interfered with the capital-market channel. In past crises, large companies had the alternative of issuing bonds when troubled banks raised rates or curtailed lending. In the past decade, however, deregulation allowed mega-banks to become major players in capital markets. The dead weight of their toxic assets diminished the capacity of markets to keep debt and equity capital flowing to businesses and scared investors away.\n\nObstructions in the monetary policy channels worsened a recession that has proven to be longer and, by many measures, more painful than any post-World War II slump. With its conventional policy tools blocked, the Fed resorted to unprecedented measures, opening new channels to bypass the blocked ones and restore the economy’s credit flows.\n\nIn summary, the Blob reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy’s transmission mechanisms. To be sure, the Fed found ways, under Ben Bernanke’s adroit leadership, to bypass those blockages by undertaking unorthodox policies. It would be dishonest of me to say that I have not supported many of the Rube Goldbergian devices we have crafted. But it would be disingenuous of me to deny that these measures carry great and unprecedented risk. They give rise to questions about the Federal Reserve’s commitment to its traditional mandate, to suspicions that we are undertaking fiscal-like initiatives and to concerns that these initiatives might compromise our independence by putting us on the road to political perdition. At a minimum, they bloat our balance sheet, requiring us to now craft and articulate an exit strategy that might take us even further from our traditional practices.\n\nIn my view, the sooner we are able to return to traditional policymaking the better. I do not believe we can do so without treating the basic pathology of too big to fail.\n\nSo I am a keen student of the various remedies that have been prescribed. They essentially break down into two camps: “learn to live with ’em” or “get rid of ’em.”\n\nThe “learn to live with ’em” camp bases its position on a presumption that we derive economic value from large firms, especially in a globalized world where businesses need transnational financial services delivered efficiently. Only this week, Josef Ackermann, the CEO of Deutsche Bank, speaking in Frankfurt, restated the argument that big banks provide “the necessary means for financing growth and innovation” because they can most efficiently provide loans and services like cash management and foreign-exchange trading for big international companies. [4]\n\nThoughtful proponents of this approach recognize that the benefits of supra-large banks—from formerly traditional banks like Citigroup to newly converted ones like Goldman Sachs—come with risks that must be corralled. According to members of this camp, that corralling may be achieved through a mixture of various tools, including:\n\nEssentially, the proponents of this approach understand the fallibility of regulatory institutions and the permeability of rules and capital requirements but believe they can be improved upon.\n\nMembers of the “get rid of ’em” school do not believe that there is any other way aside from their own to treat the moral hazard created by a too-big-to-fail culture that inculcates the privatization of gains and the socialization of losses—what some refer to as “heads I win, tails you lose.” They understand the academic and management theories that posit the benefits of size and sophistication, especially in a globally interconnected world. They also accept that banks need to invest their own capital and hedge against investments that flow naturally from their banking business. But they are wary of the distortions they believe derive from having government guarantees of deposits and other underpinnings of public trust underwrite additional risk-taking ventures such as proprietary trading.\n\nIn trying to develop my own perspective, I return to where I began this monologue: to more of Milton’s prose. The stanza from Paradise Lost that follows closely upon the one I read earlier is as follows:\n\nThe Fed, like the other regulators and the Congress that will ultimately fashion a new regulatory regime designed to treat too-big-to-fail and other problems, is far from divine. We are a worldly institution created to further the efficiency of mammon’s great agent of capitalism, what I consider to be the most effective vehicle for economic progress. I am a disciple of Schumpeterian creative destruction: I accept that, painful as it might be, destruction of errant or inefficient economic agents must occur for progress to take place in a capitalist society—that without failure there can be no good. Therefore, in the words of Milton, I would say that regulation should be designed to enable financial institutions to be “sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.”\n\nOverall, I would recommend that the treatment for too-big-to-fail be crafted with the late Irving Kristol in mind. Kristol was no Milton. Nor was he an economist. But he was nonetheless a wise man whose writings in the journal The Public Interest had an early influence on my approach to problem-solving. In writing his eulogy this past September in the New York Times, David Brooks summarized him this way: “Kristol grew up in a working-class neighborhood … and seems to have absorbed the elemental Jewish commandment: Don’t be a schmuck. Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the way people really are.”[6]\n\nIt is a fantastical notion to ignore the dynamic that leads business and financial organizations to want to grow to become the biggest and the most profitable. It is a fantastical notion to assume that smart bankers will not take advantage of government guarantees to customers or creditors of one part of their business to incur risk and higher returns in another part, as long as they are allowed to do so. It is a fantastical notion to expect that the law of unintended consequences can be repealed and that mortals, be they bankers or regulators, will not henceforth miscalculate risk or take misguided actions. It is a fantastical notion to expect that having once pulled poorly run, systemically threatened firms out of the fire, government won’t do it again, no matter how many times and how loudly it says it won’t.\n\nTo craft a smart solution to this vexing problem of banks considered too big to fail requires that we deal with the way people and businesses really are. To me this means finding ways not to live with ’em and getting on with developing the least disruptive way to have them divest those parts of the “franchise,” such as proprietary trading, that place the deposit and lending function at risk and otherwise present conflicts of interest.\n\nBut we can’t stop there. Our supervisory structure must ensure that these institutions do not have the opportunity, or the incentive, to grow to too-big-to-fail status again. Activities that present risks to taxpayers must be contained using at least some of the tools proposed by the “learn to live with ’em” camp—increased capital requirements, “living wills,” “Coco” bonds and the like. We would also be well-served to roll back various pieces of the government’s safety net, forcing creditors of risky, nonbank behavior to bear the full cost of their actions. These higher requirements could act as a tax or disincentive to bigness and, if structured properly, could provide a useful brake on the dynamic that leads to reckless growth and unmanageable complexity.\n\nI know this conclusion will hardly endear me to the handful of large institutions that are commonly viewed as too big to fail. But I think it best to take a lesson from Paradise Lost and “revoke the high decree … which ordained their freedom”—for, after all, “they themselves ordained their fall.”\n\nWith that, I’ll stop. And, in the best traditional practice of central bankers, proceed to avoid answering any questions you might have."

But I know better. When I made my hapless run for the U.S. Senate in 1994, I managed to visit every nook and cranny of this state. I know from personal experience that, thankfully, there is nothing normal about Texas.\n\nTake my wife’s family, for example. Her great-great grandfather was William Miles. He hailed from Nip ’n Tuck, a little town near what is now Longview in East Texas. He served gallantly in the Mexican Wars and then, after a substantial interlude, joined the 14th Regiment of the Texas Unmounted Cavalry—they had no horses but they were proud Texans and called themselves “cavalry” nonetheless—and went off to fight for the Confederacy. He had his arm shot off in battle, was discharged and sent home. To get back, he swam across the Mississippi—no small feat for a one-armed man. He is memorialized by the nickname “Sidestroke” in the family annals. Old “Sidestroke” then walked back to Nip ’n Tuck to become a dirt farmer.\n\nHe arrived home broke; he could not immediately afford a mule, so until he could, he hitched a plow to his six daughters—there was a seventh but she got smart, married a Yankee and was promptly disowned. William Miles never spent a dime; he saved every penny he earned and prospered handsomely. He died in 1910. His will instructed his executor to auction off all he had accumulated—his house, his equipment, the works—so his net worth could be calculated in hard currency.\n\nAll this is captured on his tombstone in the Gum Springs graveyard near Longview. His stone records the dates of his and his wife Nancy’s births and deaths, and the dates of his service in both the Army of the U.S.A. and the Army of Jefferson Davis. On the back of the stone, for all the world to see, are carved the words “Value of my estate $44,378.34.” That’s nearly $1 million in today’s dollars. That’s the good news. He died a rich man. The bad news is that his will required his daughters to buy everything back that was sold in his estate sale.\n\nYou cannot tell me that Austin has a corner on the market for being “weird.”\n\nInteresting as all of that is, I know you didn’t ask me to return tonight to regale you with the legends and lore of my wife’s family. You asked me here to provide insight into something even more resilient and more “weird” than William “Sidestroke” Miles—our economy. So let’s get down to business.\n\nAs you all know, the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), met last Tuesday and Wednesday. Our statement—released like clockwork at the conclusion of every FOMC meeting precisely at 1:15 p.m. Central time—summed up our collective wisdom: With a host of caveats, we noted that activity in the American economy has continued to pick up and appears to be on the mend. Despite this progress, however, we remain vigilant.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nJust this spring, economic conditions were drastically different than they are today. We were engaged in battle against an attack that ravaged our economy on four fronts. First: a collapse in home building, the worst we’d seen since the Great Depression. Second: a reversal of wealth—the worst decline in real or nominal terms that we can find in data that begin in 1952. Third: a financial panic, complete with extreme risk aversion and a credit contraction in securities and direct credit markets. And last but not least: a bank credit crunch.\n\nA severe contraction had taken root beginning in the fall of 2008, and the Federal Reserve, as the monetary authority of the United States, was duty-bound to do everything within its power to mitigate the damage. Our task was no less than to drag the global economy abruptly and forcefully from the edge of the abyss.\n\nI believe we will be judged by history as having done so. Time will tell, of course. But this much I know: The policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve, combined with the inherent resiliency of the American economy, have helped us reverse the onslaught on three of those four fronts. Despite deterioration in nonresidential construction, the housing sector appears to be stabilizing. With regard to wealth, after plunging 24 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from mid 2007 through the first quarter of this year, net worth across all American households rose slightly in the second quarter and will likely be found to have risen in the third. And, after surging to incredibly high levels, interest rate spreads have returned to near-normalcy in the commercial paper and mortgage markets and are returning to Earth in the bond market.\n\nEfforts to free up bank credit have helped slow the pace at which banks have tightened their credit standards. The latest reports we have received from bank lending officers, released just yesterday, confirm this. However, with the lagging effects of loan quality problems, difficulties in the commercial real estate market and uncertainty over regulatory reform, a full resuscitation of bank credit has yet to take place and will take considerable time.\n\nThe progress we’ve made on each of these fronts is most certainly a welcome relief, but questions remain. Where are we headed, and when will we get there?\n\nAs we closed out the summer, I pointed out in an interview with the Dallas Morning News that there were good reasons to expect fairly strong output growth—what an economist would call “above trend growth”—in the second half of this year.[1] The reason? I like to call it the “Johnny Mercer effect,” after the great Hollywood lyricist of the 1940s: Growth follows almost automatically if you “ac-cen-chu-ate the positive and e-lim-i-nate the negative.”[2]\n\nThat’s essentially what we saw in the third quarter. Fixed investment flattened out and ceased to be a drag on the economy, eliminating an important negative from the GDP calculus. Consumer spending, which was neutral in the first half, became a strong positive. And exports and inventory investment did a 180, flipping from sources of weakness to sources of strength.[3]\n\nNow, I’ve often thought that economic forecasters seem to be cursed—or maybe blessed, I suppose, dependent upon your point-of-view—with a short-term memory: They tend to extrapolate only the most recent trends into the future. As if goosed by the more optimistic tone of the latest GDP release, many now believe that solid output growth will extend into the first half of next year. The latest Blue Chip survey, for example, shows that professional forecasters expect GDP growth averaging 2.8 percent in the first half of 2010.\n\nI am wary of the consensus view. For a good while now, I’ve suggested that we are more likely to see a more uneven recovery—not a “V”-shaped recovery but something more akin to a check mark, where the elongated arm of that check mark inclines at a slope that is less than desirable and might possibly be repressed by an occasional pause or several quarters of weak growth.\n\nWhy a check mark?\n\nSeveral recent sources of strength are likely to wane as we head into next year. Cash-for-clunkers and the first-time-homebuyer tax credit have both shifted demand forward, increasing sales today at the expense of sales tomorrow. Neither of these programs can be repeated with any real hope of achieving anywhere near the same effect: The more demand you steal from the future, the less future demand there is for you to steal. The general tax cuts and government spending increases included in this year’s fiscal stimulus package won’t have their peak impact on the level of GDP until sometime in 2010, but their peak impact on the growth of GDP has come and gone; the fiscal stimulus continues to drive GDP upward, compared with what it would otherwise have been, but the increments to GDP are beginning to shrink. And, as we all know, the shot in the arm that our economy is receiving from inventory adjustments is, while welcome, inherently transitory.\n\nWhat about growth in the longer term—the second half of 2010 and beyond? American households have finally come to realize that they’ve been playing the part of the grasshopper in Aesop’s fable: They see that our previous spending boom was financed by somewhat reckless disregard for tomorrow by over-eager creditors feeding their desire for unsustainable leveraging of their income and balance sheets and, for the nation as a whole, by increases in overseas borrowing. That reality has been largely absorbed, and consumer spending is growing again—albeit from a lower base and at a slower pace. I doubt it will recover its previous vigor for some time to come. I expect that the strong bounce-back in consumer demand that we’ve come to expect in recoveries past will be absent this time around as Americans recalibrate the proportion of their income and wealth that they need to save versus what they need to consume. We need not become a nation as parsimonious as William Miles, but we are going to have to be more ant- than grasshopper-like in our behavior.[4]\n\nWith a likely subpar showing from household spending, one other candidate as a source of growth is government spending. We should be hesitant to become overly dependent on it. As consumer credit conditions gradually improve, any boost the economy gets from growth in government purchases will increasingly be offset by reductions in household spending—people will save to meet a higher prospective tax burden.\n\nUnfortunately, this prospect of an uneven and comparatively weak recovery—in combination with excess capacity and uncertainty about the impact of new government initiatives and regulation—is taking its toll on business confidence. Firms are hesitant to add plant and equipment. In my surveys of corporate CEOs with significant capex wherewithal—a personal survey I conduct religiously before every FOMC meeting—it appears that those who are beginning to budget expanding plant and equipment are less inclined to do so here at home and more interested in doing so abroad in areas they consider to have greater risk-adjusted profit potential.\n\nMost painfully, they remain hesitant to add labor. I’m sure you all saw the headlines last Friday—despite a continuing decline in payroll losses and initial unemployment claims, the jobless rate in this country has officially reached a 26-year high of 10.2 percent, not counting those who have given up looking for work. Far fewer of you likely saw the latest numbers on labor productivity: According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics release last week, nonfarm labor productivity increased at an annualized rate of 9.5 percent in the third quarter. That is the highest quarterly increase we’ve seen in six years.\n\nWhat does this tell us? After a prolonged period of payroll growth, firms are using this downturn to reorganize and retool. To control costs and preserve margins that can cushion the top line, employers are learning to do more with less. They are squeezing all the productivity they can from their employees. You can get a snapshot of this in the recent round of earnings releases by the 453 of the S&P 500 companies that have reported third quarter performance thus far: Earnings for these companies were down 10 percent year-over-year. But top-line growth—total revenue growth—was down 14 percent. As long as this condition obtains, companies can hardly be expected to add to payrolls.\n\nThis is not surprising if you think about it. Before the crisis, we had a long period of economic expansion and easy access to money. Historically, the longer the expansion or period of prosperity, the more complacent businesses become. A growing economy, like sailing in a following sea and pleasant weather for days on end, weakens the discipline to run a tight ship. But once a storm strikes, captains of industry have no choice but to batten down the hatches and reef their sails. The more intense the storm, the longer it takes for the inefficiencies incurred during the previous expansions to recede from memory, even after fair weather returns. I would think that in this recovery period the willingness to rehire or expand capital expenditures will be long in coming. Chastised by recent experience, businesses will continue to run tight ships, with all resources, including labor, being driven to maximum efficiency.\n\nIt may be some time before significant job growth occurs and even longer before we see meaningful declines in the unemployment rate.\n\nSo we have a mixed picture for economic growth down the road, despite the pickup we’ve seen lately. What are the implications of all this for monetary policy?\n\nWith financial-market conditions normalizing—if not yet fully normal—most of the special programs that the Federal Reserve introduced last winter to backstop bank and nonbank credit have either already unwound or are rapidly doing so. For example, the special facility we put in place to revive the commercial paper market when it succumbed to paralysis last year—a facility that expanded our balance sheet by $350 billion at its peak usage level—has fallen to under $10 billion as the market has been restored. As to the longer-lived asset purchases we have made, now that mortgage-finance spreads have narrowed, our purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are tapering off. We expect those transactions—which will total up to $1.25 trillion—to be executed by the end of next year’s first quarter.\n\nA legacy of MBS acquisitions is a Fed balance sheet that has more than doubled in size. This expanded balance sheet has as its counterpart a greatly elevated level of bank reserves. Banks, seeking liquidity and avoiding risk, have so far been content to let their reserves sit at the Federal Reserve, earning a modicum of interest. Ultimately, as confidence returns, these funds will be used to support an expansion in bank lending, increasing the velocity of base money in our economy. That would not necessarily be a bad thing, within limits, given all the idle resources in the economy at present. Of course, the Fed must be wary that velocity does not explode and create inflation pressures resulting from too much money chasing too few goods and services. If credit growth at some point threatens to become excessive, we have the tools to rein it in, ranging from selling the assets we have acquired so as to suck up excess money, to adjusting the rate we pay on excess reserves, to utilizing other techniques such as large-scale reverse repurchase agreements, or “repos,” to even raising the Fed funds rate.\n\nThe press and the markets are eager to know when we might undertake a tightening in policy. The answer to this question is … “It depends.” Our mandate is to pursue the maximum level of employment consistent with long-term price stability. So, when and how rapidly we reduce our accommodative policy must depend on fine judgments about how quickly the real economy gets back on track without jeopardizing our longer-run price-stability goal. As noted in our most recent statement, the FOMC will consider a variety of economic indicators—including resource slack, inflation trends and inflation expectations—when making this decision. But for the foreseeable future, the FOMC considers policy to be appropriately calibrated to the times.\n\nMy own judgment—based partly on available estimates of slack, but also on the behavior of prices, and informed by the anecdotal input I receive monthly from business leaders as to their intentions—is that inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time, and thus our current policy is appropriate. Of course, I recognize that our measures of slack and our understanding of the determinants of inflation are uncertain. And agile business leaders can change plans on a dime. Being what some believe to be the most hawkish member of the FOMC, I am very Reagan-esque in my evaluation of inflationary potential: I trust but continually seek to verify that inflation is not raising its ugly head. So, as I’ve always done, I will keep a close eye on price developments as they unfold.\n\nRight now, I see more immediate deflationary pressures than inflationary ones. Yet I am fully aware that the law of unintended consequences is always lurking in the shadows. For instance, having spent a few years early in my banking career as a foreign exchange advisor to investors and corporations, I am particularly mindful of the risks we run by stating in FOMC statements that we expect to maintain the Fed funds rate at “exceptionally low levels” for “an extended period.” This could fuel the “carry” trade, whereby speculators—assuming U.S. rates will remain unchanged over a reasonable time horizon—can borrow plentiful amounts of dollars cheaply and invest them in securities denominated in other currencies that yield more or offer greater returns, in the process driving those securities and currencies to prices beyond their equilibrium levels. Were this to become a disorderly influence, I would expect the FOMC and other authorities to craft an appropriate remedy.\n\nTom, here is the bottom line: The Federal Reserve has done what it can to prevent Depression 2.0 and the deflation that one would have expected might accompany economic collapse. It will take some time, in my opinion, to get back on a steady pathway to a pace of growth that will result in significant job creation. We are in for a long slog. We had a snapback in growth in the third quarter and can expect that will continue in the current quarter. But looking into 2010 and perhaps to 2011, the most likely outcome is for growth to be suboptimal, unemployment to remain a vexing problem and inflation to remain subdued.\n\nMind you, you should take economic forecasts—even my own—with a big grain of salt. Jamie Galbraith’s dad, John Kenneth Galbraith, may have been more right than econometricians like to think when he said that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nNobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow has his own perspective on forecasting. During World War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with individuals who were charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead weather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed statistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The Corps’ weather forecasts were no more accurate than random rolls of a die.\n\nUnderstandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of his superiors’ response was priceless:\n\n“The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.”\n\nTom asked me to provide you tonight with my forecast for the economy. This evening, I have done as asked, drawing upon the models and judgment of the Federal Reserve, which are among the most complex and comprehensive in the world. But we cannot lose sight of the unfortunate fact that, despite our best efforts, no one can precisely predict the future. While we know where the economy has been and believe we understand the gearing of the economy as well as anybody can, we cannot know with certainty where it’s headed. That said, I hope my musings this evening have been better than “no good” and are of some assistance to you for your planning purposes.\n\nThank you for listening. Now, in the tradition that is hallmark of Federal Reserve officials, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have."

        "content": "October 16, 2009 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, President [R. Gerald] Turner.\n\nIt is common for a speaker at SMU to say how honored he is to be introduced by Gerald Turner. In my case, it is especially true. My wife’s—Nancy’s—family has been involved in SMU almost from the time Dallas Hall was the sole building on “The Hill.” Today, I am speaking in a building named for my father-in-law, the late, great Jim Collins, Class of ’37, who turned his energy to serving Dallas in the U.S. Congress after building a business: Fidelity Union Life. That business, which was sold to Allianz of Germany in the late 1970s, was the source of the funding for every facility on this campus with the name Collins or Sharp or Altshuler attached to it. Countless Collinses and Sharps and even two Fishers have been educated here. I know SMU well, and I knew Jim Collins as well as you could know any man. He would be very proud of what you have done as president of SMU and would consider you one of the greats, Gerald. And I know he would be very pleased to see his son-in-law given such a nice introduction, speaking here in the Crum Auditorium, attached to the building the university so graciously named in his honor. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nToday, you are going to hear from people who know firsthand what it means to operate a business in a globalized economy—particularly a business located in this unique part of the country, the global business nexus we call Dallas. Tom [Falk] and Rich [Templeton] are no strangers to the challenges and opportunities that await American businesses in an interconnected world, and I am confident that you all will benefit from their special insight.\n\nI’d like to speak more about the context in which global business is conducted, in order to set the stage for what I expect Tom and Rich will be saying.\n\nWe have all read the headlines and listened to the pundits’ chatter about a looming threat of “deglobalization.” A slew of armchair analysts, calling to our attention historic declines in world trade and a rise of protectionist instincts, have lamented what they believe to be an impending reversal of globalization.\n\nThis morning, I will argue that a decline in trade flows, at least to some degree, was to be expected during this tumultuous period, the most severe global financial and economic crisis in decades. I will then turn to protectionism, the bête noire of internationally minded business operators and policymakers. And then I will conclude with some comments on where we are likely to go from here, making the point that globalization is still very much alive and that, like the music of Wagner, all is not as bad as it sounds.\n\nAs usual, I will speak only for myself, not for any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve System. Which is fitting, for I will draw not only on my perspective as a Federal Reserve policymaker, but also on the four years I spent negotiating trade agreements for our country.\n\nLet’s begin with what the pundits have right: Our recent economic crisis has led to some truly historic declines in world trade. According to the International Monetary Fund’s most recent World Economic Outlook, global exports of goods and services, by volume, will decline over 11 percent this year, with exports of advanced economies projected to fare worse than those of their emerging and developing peers.[1] If you look to the history books, you will learn that, by some measures, the pace of international trade’s decline in the first year of this crisis was even greater than what we experienced during the Great Depression.[2]\n\nEvidence of the harsh nature of the contraction in trade we have recently experienced can be found in international shipping costs. For years, I have used the Baltic Dry Index, a price index that captures movements in the shipping market for dry bulk commodities, as one indicator of the relative health of international trade flows. In the span of less than seven months, this index took an incredible nosedive, plummeting over 94 percent by the early part of December 2008. The price data for leasing “Capesize” vessels—one of the best indicators of shipments of iron ore, a critical ingredient to the key building blocks of infrastructure worldwide—is even more volatile: They reached a peak of nearly $235,000 per day in the summer of 2008 and, since that time, have fallen over 80 percent.[3] Data for container ships, the carriers of many consumer durables, are similarly bleak, as are the data for the rails that carry goods from the ports to the distribution points of consumer outlets. And, if you’d read page C1 from today’s edition of the second-best newspaper in the world, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, you would have seen that Alliance and DFW airports—in addition to others, like San Francisco, LAX and JFK—experienced sizable cargo business declines last year (although, for DFW, relatively less than its peers).[4] While the numbers were not broken out, it is likely that at least some of that downturn could be attributed to a decline in goods shipped between international destinations.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, we went from shortage-driven inflation in transportation costs to dramatic overcapacity and slack. A little over a year and a half ago, daily lease prices of railcars in the United States were escalating rapidly; as of Oct. 1 of this year, roughly 178,000 railroad-owned freight cars, which placed end to end would total some 2,900 miles, have been laid up in storage for at least five months, according to what Matt Rose, the CEO of BNSF, recently told me. This is something of an improvement from a comparable car count for the previous month of 185,000, but it nonetheless provides a graphic indication of the enormous amount of slack in idle rail assets and the compression that had occurred in final demand for finished goods produced both domestically and abroad.\n\nThe broader, aggregate data speak to the implosion in trade that we have witnessed. As of June of this year, our quarterly imports, by volume, had fallen just over 20 percent after peaking in the third quarter of 2007. A similar measure of American exports, by volume, peaked later—as the crisis went global in the second quarter of 2008—but still managed to drop roughly 15 percent through this June.\n\nThese are just some of the doomsday figures that naysayers have highlighted to portend an onslaught of deglobalization. To be sure, these data are quite startling and, indeed, quite historic. But do they portend that deglobalization is taking root? I think not.\n\nAs most of you know, I am not a trained economist. I earned my bona fides like many of you in this room—in the world of private business, after earning an M.B.A. at Stanford: the SMU of California. That said, I have spent enough time around economists to learn two things:\n\nBefore asserting that “deglobalization” is occurring, we  must understand what has driven these global trade declines and look behind the simple headline figures and “instant analysis”—my favorite oxymoron—that accompanies the assertion of the Eeyores of punditry who claim that globalization is at risk.\n\nLet’s start by examining how the dramatic trade declines of the past year compare with what we otherwise might have expected in the midst of a global recession and whether a reversal of globalization, or maybe something else, is to blame. My colleagues at the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute—specifically, its director, Mark Wynne, and one of its senior economists, Jian Wang—have been doing just that.[5] I want to share some of their preliminary findings with you.\n\nFirst, a look to the dictionary: What exactly do we mean by globalization? Let me give you my CliffsNotes definition: Globalization is the process by which national borders become increasingly open to international transfers of goods, services, capital, people, ideas and a variety other economic inputs and outputs. To businessmen and women, globalization is about managing to greater efficiency by driving the costs of goods sold, expenses, inventory sourcing and management to optimization. It is also about maximizing market reach and expanding top line volume. For the business operator, globalization is a means to better profits so as to maximize returns to a company’s stakeholders. You will no doubt hear much about this from Tom and Rich.\n\nTo macroeconomists, globalization is about the integration of national markets into one global market. Fluctuations in the flows of goods and services may certainly be necessary for, or symptomatic of, such integration, but the extent to which any economy can be said to be globalized—the extent to which a domestic economy is integrated with economies elsewhere—is best judged on the basis of how close its domestic prices for various goods and services are to those on world markets.\n\nIn the presence of transportation costs, barriers to trade and so on, we can reasonably expect that there will be a difference between the domestic price of a good and the price that prevails globally. The size of this difference or distortion determines just how much of the good we will import and consume. With the removal of these barriers, that distortion will decline, domestic prices will fall and trade will increase.\n\nIt is possible for trade volumes to increase without an integration of markets. While trade growth is necessary for globalization, it is by no means sufficient. A domestic boom, for example, could leave us clamoring for all kinds of goods and services, in all price ranges, without driving down those domestic price distortions. The same could happen in reverse: A global recession that reduces import demand would likely lead to a decline in trade but might not have any effect on the wedge between domestic and international prices.\n\nThat, arguably, is largely what took place from last fall through the first half of this year. As the crisis spread from North America to the rest of the globe, the dramatic deterioration in economic prospects and the contagious seizure that afflicted financial markets in the advanced economies following the failure of Lehman Brothers last September caused the markets for emerging-market exports to dry up, engulfing them in the global downturn.\n\nAs policymakers, we would prefer to study price differentials when looking for evidence of globalization. Trade growth, again, is necessary but insufficient. And alternatively, evidence of trade decline is likely necessary, but insufficient, as evidence of that alleged multisyllable phenomenon, deglobalization.\n\nUnfortunately, we lack the reliable global price data needed to perform a more thorough analysis on that front. As such, we must move forward—cautiously—with our discussion of trade flows. If we posit that deglobalization is not the likely culprit behind the recent historic declines we have witnessed in global trade, we have to ask ourselves what other factors might be at play.\n\nWith regard to fluctuations in international trade relative to movements in the business cycle, two facts are worth mentioning. First, exports and imports are, in economists’ lingo, “procyclical.” In other words, they move in tandem with GDP. Second, swings in exports and imports are far more volatile than those of the business cycle. The average volatility, or standard deviation, of GDP is about 1.7 percent. For exports, that number is over three times greater, at 5.6 percent, and for imports, 5.2 percent.\n\nIn short, international trade flows move in the same direction as—and are a lot more volatile than—the overall economy.\n\nWhy is this the case? Despite innovations that now allow market participants to pass what we once defined as “nontradable” assets across national borders, the composition of international trade is still heavily skewed toward goods. Goods, by value, make up close to 70 and 84 percent of our exports and imports, respectively. More important, most of those goods fall into the category of “durables.” In 2008, for example, more than 60 percent of American traded-goods trade, excluding energy, was classified as durable.\n\nA durable good can be loosely thought of as anything with a relatively longer lifespan. Consumers and producers make use of these products for an extended period. As an economist might say, they provide utility over time. For a firm, this might include large manufacturing equipment. For a household, it might include a car or a refrigerator. Or, in the case of my friend and neighbor, Jerry Jones, it might include an 11,500-square-foot, flat-screen television that footballs can reach. Demand for these goods—except for in the case of Jerry, who is a unique risk taker!—is quite volatile. When the economy hits a wall, as it did last year, households postpone these larger purchases, and firms rein in previously scheduled capital expenditures.\n\nThat is what we’ve seen this year: In the final three months of 2008 and beginning of 2009—again, as the crisis went global—worldwide demand for durable goods fell substantially, registering annualized quarter-over-quarter declines in some developing nations that are well into the double digits. Given the contribution that these goods make to international trade, it should come as less of a surprise that global exports and imports dried up in the midst of the most severe global recession since World War II.\n\nThere is another reason we might expect a relatively sharper decline in trade flows during a global economic downturn—one that is tied to globalization itself. Economists call it “vertical specialization” or “internationalized production.” The other gentlemen you will hear from today might know it simply as doing business in a global world.\n\nMany goods today are manufactured in more than one place. Firms are no longer beholden to the labor and capital available within their own national borders. They can source various stages of production from anywhere in the world, using each host nation’s comparative advantage to drive down costs and expand profit margins. Whereas in previous periods, trade was composed solely of finished products, the story is now much more complex. Firms export materials to countries around the world and receive finished—or perhaps near-finished—goods that they can then sell at home or abroad or ship away for further finishing.\n\nWhen global demand takes a hit, we don’t just see a drop-off in the international exchange of finished goods. Intermediate products that multinational firms trade in this globalized production process fall by the wayside as well. Trade losses are compounded, relative to what they might have been before globalization began.\n\nAgain, it should come as no surprise, then, that as the global economy declines, trade flows decline even more.\n\nWhat has come as a surprise, however, is that the magnitude of this decline has been over and above what we might have expected based on our understanding of fundamentals.\n\nIn the past, econometric models with only two variables—American income and dollar strength—have done reasonably well explaining quarterly fluctuations in our imports. Also, and not surprisingly, models that contain foreign income and dollar strength have typically done well explaining quarterly fluctuations in American exports.\n\nUntil last fall.\n\nI am given to reminding the economists at the Dallas Fed that my undergraduate professor, John Kenneth Galbraith, used to say that economic modeling and forecasting was invented to “make astrology look respectable.” So I have asked them to dig deeper into what might have caused this breakdown. As you may recall, there was no shortage of stories in the financial media last fall about the drying up of trade finance and credit and its detrimental effect on trade flows. Given the nature of the crisis and the abundance of this anecdotal evidence, it is reasonable to assume that a severe reduction of trade finance may well have been the culprit.\n\nTrade finance is, broadly, every kind of loan, insurance policy or guarantee tied to an international good or service transaction. It includes a range of tools: from direct credit extended by an exporter to government-backed guarantees to letters of credit issued by commercial and multilateral banks and private insurers. Trade finance instruments can even act as pure risk hedges, insuring against the myriad potential problems (commercial, political and the like) that can arise in international transactions.\n\nWhile hard data on trade-specific finance are difficult to obtain, there are a few quantifiable measures we can point to as evidence of a drying up of this important trade tool. Since the summer of 2007, private capital coming into and out of the U.S. has plunged. In the span of one year, these flows fell from 15 percent of our GDP to zero. Declines in trade credit were similarly dramatic. The contraction in trade credit available, for example, to Korean firms in the fourth quarter of last year was the most severe since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. And for Brazilian firms, the contraction was more severe than during the real devaluation crisis in the early part of this decade.\n\nWhen a global flight to quality takes hold—something we’ve witnessed to a startling degree during this financial crisis—we might expect that investors, banks and firms would limit their exposure to relatively risky nations. Surprisingly, though, emerging markets were not the only victims. Firms in the U.S., Japan and Germany, for instance, also saw record drops—literally unprecedented at the end of last year—in trade credit liabilities.\n\nThe subject of trade finance is very much on the front burner in the debate on the need for a new regulatory regime governing financial institutions. Had you read page 4 of yesterday’s Financial Times, you would have seen an intriguing article discussing the accounting treatment of trade credit and an assertion that the “shortage of trade finance [during the financial crisis] was responsible for more than 10–15 percent of the fall [in global trade].” It went on to say that “… bankers warn that a diminished capacity for trade-related lending could create bottlenecks that will slow or stop the recovery.”[6]\n\nHere is the point: The dramatic turndown in trade we have witnessed was the result not of some invidious plan to undo globalization. It resulted from a turndown in the domestic gearing of the world’s larger economies, which spread to the emerging economies that feed into demand from those larger economies, and it was exacerbated by the financial crisis, including a clampdown in trade credit.\n\nThis does not mean globalization is being undone. It does not mean that “deglobalization” has begun.\n\nThat said, we must remain ever vigilant to forces that we know can undo the good that has come from globalization. The biggest threat of all is the political instinct when times are tough to embrace protectionism.\n\nToday, protectionism is more subtle than in the past. Governments no longer have to resort to explicit tariffs and quotas to stave off the inflow of foreign goods and services. They can be more creative. At the Dallas Fed, we commonly watch indicators released by the World Trade Organization such as antidumping investigations. While these numbers are still well within the experience of the past decade, their increase throughout 2008 and in the first half of 2009 is not something we can simply ignore.\n\nOne cannot be too blunt about the dangers of protectionism. It is, quite frankly, the crack cocaine of economics: It may provide politicians with a temporary high, yet it is instantly addictive and inevitably proves debilitating and fatal for an economy. We must keep a watchful eye on quick fixes—like the imposition of tariffs on affordable Chinese tires—to make sure this dangerous instinct does not get out of hand. We cannot forget that what made the Great Depression “great” or the even worse 23-year “Long Depression” that closed out the 19th century “long,” was the onslaught of protectionist measures enacted by a host of countries around the world. We would be well-served to remember that lesson.\n\nHaving said all that, I must tell you, as a former trade representative, I am encouraged by recent developments on the trade front. For example, we hear little these days from Sen. Schumer and Sen. Graham (or even the Secretary of the Treasury) about the need to take punitive actions in retribution for what they consider insufficient flexibility in the exchange rate of the Chinese currency. While I disagree, from a free-trader’s perspective, on the Section 421 action taken on Chinese tires—an action that only hurts lower-income groups in the U.S. who buy those cheaper tires—I assume, without any more knowledge than what I learned about the way things operated when I was a trade representative during the second term of the Clinton administration, that the current administration undertook that action as an inexpensive way to placate an important constituency and that there might have been far more expensive alternatives on the table. And I take heart that while Congress has not seen fit to act on the U.S.–Korea Free Trade Agreement—an agreement I have long championed—it has at least been agreed to between negotiating parties and has occasioned an agreement between Korea and the European Union that was initialed yesterday (and modeled in-fact on the Korea–U.S. agreement).\n\nWhile I doubt the practicability of letting the G-20 or the IMF become global regulatory forums or rule-making bodies that trump sovereign authorities of their member nations, I also take heart that at least these forums are being used proactively to discuss common problems and keep the momentum for positive financial reform and continued trade liberalization moving forward. That momentum could have easily gone into reverse under the difficult global financial and economic conditions that have obtained.\n\nThis does not mean that those who believe, as I do, that a more fully interconnected, globalized economy leads to the most efficient allocation of resources (which in turn leads to a more productive, efficient and prosperous environment for American businesses) should let down their guard. It does mean that we have cause for optimism. Globalization is proceeding. That’s the good news. And nobody is in better position to exploit it and make it work to the benefit of their stakeholders than Dallas-based businesses.\n\nThank you. And now, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have."

        "content": "September 29, 2009 Dallas, Texas\n\nBut, remember the theme here—cautious optimism. While housing is showing some signs of having reached a bottom, we need to recognize that it is a sector still on life support. The Federal Reserve has been buying over 70 percent of the new mortgage originations in the MBS market—a process that has lowered mortgage rates and increased the availability of credit at affordable rates to a large swath of the market. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has announced its intention to slow its rate of mortgage acquisitions in the hope that private funding will begin to emerge. And the market for the purchase of new homes has also been helped tremendously by an $8,000 credit for new home buyers.\n\nOf course, there is some concern that the hope for a housing rebound could succumb to the headwinds experienced earlier if the efforts of fiscal and monetary authorities are allowed expire. Yet, that said, there is, in my opinion, a limit to the life support that can be provided by either the Federal Reserve on the monetary front or the Congress on the fiscal front. The market for housing will not become truly robust until market forces replace the prostheses of government support. We have thus indicated to the marketplace that, for our part, the FOMC expects we will complete the execution of our $1.25 trillion intervention in the mortgage-backed securities market by the end of the first quarter of next year.\n\n* * *\n\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have not hesitated in the past to vote against the majority of the FOMC when I felt they were being too accommodative, and I have been outspoken on the dangers of prolonged monetary stimulus in the future. Many of the Fed’s special credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip as financial markets have begun to function in a more normal manner. And my colleagues have come to accept the arguments I made regarding the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the Treasury by not increasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal Reserve reducing its balance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be converted to bank loans, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary policy is initiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin as soon as there are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the lending capacity of the banking system is capable of expansion.\n\nI am not alone on this front. I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will stand and deliver in a timely way. And I expect that when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, my colleagues and I will move with an alacrity that, if needed, will be equal in speed and intensity to that with which we pursued monetary accommodation."

        "content": "September 29, 2009 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Ralph [Babb] for that kind introduction.\n\nA little over a year ago, the nation was staring straight into the jaws of economic ruin. The Federal Reserve stepped into the breach and did what central bankers are called to do: We assumed the role of lender of last resort, enacting a sequel to the playbook written by the Bank of England over 180 years ago following the Panic of 1825. We opened the flood gates and lent freely, instituting unconventional measures to keep the financial lungs of the global economy from collapsing.\n\nIn doing so, we took enormous risk with our reputation and with our balance sheet, expanding it from north of $800 billion before the crisis to $2 trillion today. We knew full well that this would lead to a gnashing of teeth about the long-term consequences of our actions, not the least of which is the potential for all the money we have pumped into the economy to spark an inflationary conflagration once its gears start to mesh again.\n\nI am going to talk to you today, first, about where the economy and inflation now stand and then say a few words about the opportunities that lie before us as Texans as we move on down the road.\n\nThe long and short of it is that there are presently some signs that the economy is stabilizing and even reviving in certain areas, despite mixed signals. Financial markets are continuing to improve; household spending is stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; businesses are making progress in aligning inventories, though sales are still anemic and CEOs are continuing to cut back on fixed investment and payrolls. Given both the monetary accommodation we at the Fed have put in place and the stimulus of fiscal policy, it is now reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of economic growth in a context of price stability.\n\nThe operative words in that sentence were \"gradual\" and \"in a context of price stability.\" So, just what are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\n\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies in a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting in order to get a read on how they are positioning their enterprises.\n\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase, what to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are still suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from \"post-traumatic slack syndrome.\"\n\nUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready money and robust global demand. They were geared toward the expansion of plant, equipment and payrolls. At the same time, inflationary pressures were building. Businesses took every measure possible to boost their top lines by passing on rising costs through higher prices. As we entered the summer of 2008, the inflation data exhibited frightful tendencies. Of the 178 items in the consumer's basket used to measure PCE, 77 percent were rising, and the number rising above 3 percent per annum was the highest we had seen in nearly two decades.\n\nThere are limits to the costs that can reasonably be passed on to consumers without damaging top-line revenue performance. Thus, simultaneously, businesses worked like beavers to preserve their bottom lines by controlling the costs of goods and services they sold, shifting their management models and budgeting accordingly.\n\nThen they experienced a traumatic shock. Demand imploded. The equity and fixed-income markets seized up. Bank credit evaporated. The growth of the global economy hit a wall. Whereas just over a year ago managers were coping with a pervasive scarcity of inputs and escalating prices, there is now an abundance of almost every input and output and no pricing power. There are too many ships at sea; too many rail cars; too many airplanes and trucks; too many homes; too many hotels and apartments and office buildings; too many retail stores and malls and convenience stores; too much oil, natural gas and corn; and, according to Wall Street Journal reports last week, even too much champagne and bottled water.[1]\n\nAnd yes, thank you Lord, we have finally come to realize there are too many lawyers.\n\nIn almost every sector of the economy—save for nonelective medical services and a few basic commodities being hoarded by the Chinese—the CEOs I survey are struggling to cope with excess capacity and slack.\n\nBusinesses trying to sell products and services feel they are pushing on a string and are adjusting their behavior accordingly. To maintain sales volumes and clear inventories in the face of weakened demand, they are cutting prices. In the fourth quarter of last year, we began to see an upward shift in the number of items falling, rather than rising, in price. In the July data recently released, almost 50 percent of the items in the PCE basket—weighted either by simple count or expenditure—were falling in price. Small wonder that headline inflation was negative over the year ended in June.\n\nAnd top lines have evaporated. In this most recent quarter, for example, the 376 nonfinancial companies in the S&P 500 reported a nearly 20 percent decline in top-line revenues. This is the third sales decline in a row—the first time we have seen this since 1965.\n\nThe new numbers tell me two things. First, for the immediate future, the risk to price stability is a deflationary risk, not an inflationary one. And second, businesses will continue to run tight budgets as they try to preserve profit margins while operating in the absence of pricing power with the pervasive difficulty of expanding top-line revenues in the face of weak demand. They will continue to focus on cost control, most painfully by shedding workers and driving those who remain on the payroll to higher levels of productivity.\n\nAll of which means that we are likely to see a prolonged period of sluggish economic performance and uncomfortably high unemployment as businesses reallocate capital and labor to fit the new economic landscape.\n\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been, and will continue to be, impeded by financial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I would argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having normalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that financial headwinds like these take years to abate.\n\nTo offset those headwinds, fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so with the intent of limiting the damage to disposable income from unprecedented declines in wage and salary income—while trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\n\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the makeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net exports—the \"G,\" or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis, while \"C\" is flaccid, \"I\" is hesitant and net \"X\" is tentative. At the present rate, federal, state and local authorities are expected to spend, net of intragovernmental transfers, $5.4 trillion in 2009—just under 40 percent of expected GDP.\n\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures come with a real long-term price tag: higher tax rates, greater national indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates and the debasement of the dollar driven by the government's issuance of massive amounts of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government limit the American people's willingness to rely on the public sector to drive overall economic growth. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\n\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic stimulus while pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government's debt-finance obligations. The secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration and the Congress will work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. But this is no simple task. It is now common knowledge that deficits are growing at $3 million per minute and will accumulate to some $9.1 trillion over the next decade. And our fiscal predicament is compounded by the embedded unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By our calculation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the present value of the unfunded debt of these two entitlement programs has reached $104 trillion, with $88.9 trillion of that due to Medicare alone.\n\nThe legendary actor Errol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in \"reconciling [his] gross habits with [his] net income.\" I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their limit of tolerance of the \"gross habits\" of government and the net new indebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which suggests that, as an antidote to what ails the economy, government spending is a thin reed on which to rely. Given the expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will be a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable dent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something like a check mark, with a near-term snapback from the short, intense downstroke we have experienced, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to the elongated side of the mark.\n\nMind you, one of my college professors was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned his students that \"the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.\" My forecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a Piscean, and I'm sticking with it.\n\nAs to the long-term dangers of inflation posed by the expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, I remain ever vigilant. I have been outspoken on the reduced need for monetary stimulus in the future. Many of the Fed's special credit facilities have been winding down at a rapid clip as financial markets have begun to function in a more normal manner. And I have been outspoken on the necessity for the Fed to maintain its independence from the Treasury by not increasing its purchases of long-term Treasury securities. As to the Federal Reserve reducing its balance sheet so as not to monetize the excess reserves waiting to be converted to bank loans to the private sector, I have been very clear: Given the lag between the time monetary policy is initiated and when it impacts the economy, that wind-down process needs to begin as soon as there are convincing signs that economic growth is gaining traction and that the lending capacity of the banking system is capable of expansion. Cynics retort that \"the Fed may know what to do—but will it have the guts to pull the trigger?\" Well, we Texans are not afraid to pull the trigger (as anybody knows who has gone duck hunting with vice presidents of the United States!). I have faith my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee will stand and deliver in a timely way.\n\nRecently, a book titled In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke's War on the Great Panic, written by the Wall Street Journal's David Wessel, was released. In it, he describes me as one of the \"jocks\" on the Federal Open Market Committee who is \"determined to show [his] manhood by talking tough about inflation and economic rectitude.…\"[2] He's got that right. I am proud of it. I am paid to be a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity, and I aim to earn my pay.\n\nThe Fed does not pay me to promote Dallas and Texas. But I do anyway.\n\nI am grateful beyond belief that Ray Hunt, who was then chairman of the Dallas Fed board, brought me home from eight years in Washington to be president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. I loved being an ambassador; I loved negotiating for my country. But you know what they say. \"Washington is 10 square miles, surrounded by reality; Washington is Hollywood for ugly people; Washington is a place where a friend is someone who stabs you in the chest.\" These are exaggerations. But I do feel blessed to be able to work on national policy at this amazing juncture in economic history with the brilliant staff of the Dallas Fed and live among genuine people who are hard headed, pro-business, unafraid of competition, no-nonsense and hardly enamored with the heavy hand of government. They give me the perspective and moral support I need to make the arguments I do at that big mahogany table where the Federal Open Market Committee meets.\n\nIt is a great source of pride to me that in 2007, Texas created almost 30 percent of all the private sector jobs in the nation. I delight in the fact that my Federal Reserve District was the only one in the country that created jobs in 2008. Imagine that: While the nation lost over 3 million jobs in 2008 as the peanut butter hit the fan, we managed to create 63,100 jobs in Texas.\n\nIt is true that our job-creating machine rolled over in the early fall, and we entered a recession like the rest of the country. And yes, my staff projects that we will have up to 212,000 jobs lost in Texas this year. That hurts: Roughly one of every 50 people in this room has already lost or will lose his or her job this year. My expectation, however, is that the cut is going to be less deep here and require fewer stitches than elsewhere. I expect that we will come out of the recession chute not only quicker but stronger than many other parts of the country.\n\nWhy? Because we have the right stuff. If you didn't see it, you should read and re-read the Economist magazine's cover article and special section on Texas in the July 11 issue—this little baby right here. It cites many things that are music to my ears. For example, it points out that Chief Executive magazine ranks Texas as the best state in which to conduct business. It goes on to say that Texas, and I quote, \"has coped well with the recession, with an unemployment rate two points below the national average and one of the lowest rates of housing repossession … [and its] banks … did not overexpand...\" (no doubt due to great regulatory oversight by the Dallas Fed!). Texas, it concludes, \"offers a different model [than the rest of the states], based on small government … no state capital-gains or income tax, and a business-friendly and immigrant-tolerant attitude.\"[3]\n\nThe magazine is balanced; it also points out our weaknesses—primarily a lack of Tier 1 universities and the potential for a repetition of California's woes as the demography of our state changes. But it makes a clear argument that Texas has the potential to be the crucible of the future of the United States.\n\nThis wasn't written by the governor's economic development office. It was written by unbiased parties in one of the most respected journals in the world. I suggest to this chamber that they take this and every piece of propaganda we can garner and immediately put it in the hands of every CEO and leading academic in the country—in Michigan (where Ralph and Comerica moved from) and in California and New York and every other place that has run aground on the shoals of the Great Recession—and proactively go out and incent them to pull up their stakes wherever they are and replant them in this great city and state. We need to strike now and press our comparative advantage to secure the future prosperity of our children and their children and their children after that.\n\nYou ought to pursue this mission with the same kind of enthusiasm and vigor you always have in fulfilling your mission here in the North Dallas Chamber. What you have done with this group and all your other efforts for the greater Dallas area have made and continue to make a huge difference.\n\nI consider chambers of commerce to be the Marine Corps of the economic community of any city.\n\nYou remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines: \"Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.\" Dallasites don't have that problem. Texans don't have that problem. If we can just harness the spirit and devotion that is in this room and spread it city- and statewide, our future will never be in doubt and we will, indeed, inspire the nation.\n\nThanks for listening. Now, in the best tradition of the Federal Reserve, I'll do my best to avoid answering your questions."

        "content": "September 3, 2009 University of California, Santa Barbara\n\nThank you, Professor [Peter] Rupert. I am grateful to you and especially to our mutual friend, Finn Kydland, for inviting me to speak at this magnificent university tonight under the auspices of the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance.\n\nIf I may, before starting my speech, I would like to say a few words about Finn. I am half Norwegian: My mother descends from the seafaring Andersen clan of Sandefjord, a former whaling town roughly 400 kilometers east of the farmlands of Jaeren, where Finn was born. You can’t have a trace of Norwegian blood and not be proud of Finn. Only 11 Norwegians have ever won a Nobel Prize, and only six have done so in my lifetime. Three of those were prizes in economics.\n\nWhich brings to mind the old saw that there are three kinds of economists—those who can count and those who can’t.\n\nFinn can count. And reason clearly. And teach, patiently and lucidly. He has been of great help to us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in improving our understanding of time inconsistency and the business cycle. And he honors us by serving on the advisory board of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. I am most thankful to Finn for his contributions to economics, to the Federal Reserve and to Norwegian pride.\n\nNow to the subject at hand.\n\nAs Professor Rupert mentioned, my wife Nancy and I are bibliophiles. We collect rare books. This is an expensive hobby that began when I wrote a paper as a student at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business on the imperfect auction market for out-of-print first editions. As you might guess, the recent financial crisis has ratified much of what I wrote about over 30 years ago, and that, as Peter mentioned, is what enabled my recent bargain-priced purchase of the original Oxford English Dictionary and a near-mint-condition 1841 printing of Mackay’s Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, a book I recommend to anybody who wants to understand the pathology behind the recent—and any other—financial crisis.\n\nOur interest in books led us to serve on a committee that advises the Library of Congress. It was through the library that we were introduced to the country singer Dolly Parton. Most people think of Dolly as the caricature of Marx’s—Groucho’s, not Karl’s—swarmy quip: “She has eyes that folks adore so, and a torso even more so.” But Ms. Parton has a prodigious brain for music and business—and a passion for books. She has done a great deal for education—her foundation now gives out, free of charge, over 6 million books a year to pre-K children in more than 40 states, the District of Columbia, Canada and the United Kingdom to start them on the road to reading.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the economy? Well, in thinking about what I wanted to say tonight, I was reminded about an incident that occurred when Ms. Parton was given the Library of Congress’ Living Legend medal for her contributions to American culture. At dinner afterward, a rather indignant woman, offended by Ms. Parton’s … topography, thought to diminish her by noting how disproportionately small her feet seemed to be. Dolly’s saucy riposte was a classic: “Well, you know, sweetie, it is very hard to grow anything in the shade.”\n\nTonight, I wish to speak of the difficulty of growing our economy in the shade of an abundance of excess capacity for the production of goods and services worldwide.\n\nThe Present Situation\n\nYou will have read in this morning’s newspapers of the minutes released yesterday of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee meeting of Aug. 11–12 and the conclusions drawn at that meeting regarding the status of the economy. The collective sense of our group was that the economy was leveling out. We noted that conditions in financial markets were continuing to improve; household spending was stabilizing but remained constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit; and businesses were making progress in aligning inventories with still-anemic sales and were continuing to cut back on fixed investment and payrolls. The committee concluded, given both the monetary accommodation we had put in place and fiscal policy, that it was reasonable to expect a gradual resumption of economic growth in a context of price stability.\n\nThe operative words in that sentence were “gradual” and “in a context of price stability.” Just what are the prospects for economic growth? And what is the outlook for prices?\n\nIn explaining how the economy will transition from recession to recovery, we at the Dallas Fed have been referring lately to “the Johnny Mercer effect,” after the Hollywood lyricist who penned the refrain “Ac-cent-chuate the positive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.”\n\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending together account for 3 percentage points of the 3.9-percentage-point decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) that we’ve seen over the past four quarters. So, if we eliminate these negatives, we go a long way toward stabilizing the economy.\n\nThe latest monthly indicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped. Indeed, our latest estimate is that residential investment will add roughly half of 1 percentage point to GDP growth in the current quarter. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative, but as long as it does not become even more negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth. And if the pace of inventory liquidation moderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin to accentuate the positive.\n\nConsumption, the most prominent of all GDP components, has suffered its biggest four-quarter drop since 1951.[1] But, as Milton Friedman taught us, households adjust their spending levels quickly as the economic outlook changes, without waiting for the changes to be realized. In other words, they cut their spending as job prospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually occur. This means that the worst may well be over for household consumption, barring some new shock. We certainly do not expect American consumers to come surging back to fuel a global boom any time soon, but the latest data on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and retail sales are broadly consistent with Friedman’s theory. Real household spending rose for the third month in a row in July and is up 0.6 percent (not annualized) so far this year, though some of this growth undoubtedly reflects the cash-for-clunkers program, which has now expired.\n\nIn a similar vein, the latest report from the Institute for Supply Management shows export orders swinging into positive territory as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to turn around. Again, we have a reversal of signs and the elimination of a negative: Falling exports subtracted 1.9 percentage points from GDP growth over the past four quarters. Nonresidential fixed investment has been an even larger drag on the economy, subtracting 2.4 percentage points from GDP growth. But, as with consumption, the latest monthly indicators suggest a bottoming out and hint at the beginnings of a modest expansion.\n\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is kicking into gear, accentuating a positive: Government purchases added 1.3 percentage points to GDP growth last quarter, up almost 1 percentage point from the average of the previous three quarters.\n\nThe point is: A lot of former negatives are being eliminated or even turned into positives. Former positives, like government purchases, are being accentuated. The combination is beginning to propel the economy upward.\n\nThe question is: How robust and sustainable will the recovery be?\n\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth we receive as firms achieve control of their inventories will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and demand that is inherently transitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do not want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment indifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment. That means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such formerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. This reallocation will be impeded by financial markets that—while improving—continue to operate at less-than-full efficiency. I surmise that the re-gearing will take time and that, in the interim, households and businesses will focus on shoring up their savings and balance sheets rather than spending money. For consumption, that translates into a slow crawl out of purgatory. For capital expenditures and employment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight budgeting and a continued focus on absolute needs rather than wants.\n\nFor the past four years, I have personally surveyed 30 or more chief executives of key companies in a broad array of sectors before every Federal Open Market Committee meeting to get a read on how they are positioning their enterprises.\n\nThese operators of our economy—private-sector operators whose teams decide what to purchase, what to produce and how many workers are needed to turn inputs into products and sales—are still suffering from shock induced by the trauma of the crisis. I would say they are suffering from “post-traumatic slack syndrome.”\n\nUntil the summer of last year, businesses were emboldened by a prolonged period of ready money and robust global demand. They were geared toward the expansion of plants, equipment and payrolls. At the same time, inflationary pressures were building. Businesses took every measure possible to boost their top lines by passing on rising costs through higher prices. As we entered the summer of 2008, the inflation data exhibited frightful tendencies. Of the 178 items in the consumer’s basket used to measure PCE, 77 percent were rising, and the number rising above 3 percent per annum was the highest we had seen in nearly two decades.\n\nThere are limits to the costs that can reasonably be passed on to consumers without damaging top-line revenue performance. Thus, simultaneously, businesses worked like beavers to preserve their bottom lines by controlling the costs of goods and services they sold, shifting their management models and budgeting accordingly.\n\nThen they experienced a traumatic shock. Demand imploded. The equity and fixed-income markets seized up. Bank credit evaporated. The growth of the global economy hit a wall. Whereas just over a year ago managers were coping with a pervasive scarcity of inputs and escalating prices, there is now an abundance of almost every input and output and no pricing power. There are too many ships at sea; too many rail cars; too many airplanes and trucks; too many homes; too many hotels and apartments and office buildings; too many retail stores and malls and convenience stores; too much oil, natural gas and corn; and, according to Wall Street Journal reports this week, even too much champagne and bottled water.[2]\n\nAnd yes, thank you Lord, we have finally come to realize there are too many lawyers.\n\nIn almost every sector of the economy—save for nonelective medical services and a few basic commodities being hoarded by the Chinese—the CEOs I survey are struggling to cope with excess capacity and slack.\n\nBusinesses trying to sell products and services feel they are pushing on a string and are adjusting their behavior accordingly. To maintain sales volumes and clear inventories in the face of weakened demand, they are cutting prices. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, we began to see an upward shift in the number of items falling, rather than rising, in price. In the July data just released, almost 50 percent of the items in the PCE basket—weighted either by simple count or expenditure—were falling in price. Small wonder that headline inflation was negative over the year ended in June: This is the first time since 1955 that we have seen deflation.\n\nAnd top lines have evaporated. In this most recent quarter, for example, the 376 nonfinancial companies in the S&P 500 reported a nearly 20 percent decline in top-line revenues. This is the third sales decline in a row—the first time we have seen this since 1965.\n\nEvaluating the Numbers\n\nThe new numbers tell me two things. First, for the immediate future, the risk to price stability is a deflationary risk, not an inflationary one. And second, given they are operating in the shadow of the absence of pricing power and the pervasive difficulty of expanding top-line revenues in the face of weak demand, businesses will continue to run tight budgets as they try to preserve profit margins. They will continue to focus on cost control, most painfully by shedding workers and driving those who remain on the payroll to higher levels of productivity.\n\nAll of which means that we are likely to see a prolonged period of sluggish economic performance and uncomfortably high unemployment as businesses reallocate capital and labor to fit the new economic landscape.\n\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been, and will continue to be, impeded by financial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I would argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having normalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that financial headwinds like these take years to abate.\n\nTo offset those headwinds, fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so with the intent of limiting the damage to disposable income from unprecedented declines in wage and salary income—while trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\n\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the makeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net exports—the “G,” or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis, while “C” is flaccid, “I” is hesitant and net “X” is tentative. At the present rate, federal, state and local authorities are expected to spend, net of intragovernmental transfers, $5.4 trillion in 2009—just under 40 percent of expected GDP.\n\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures come with a real long-term price tag: higher tax rates, greater national indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates driven by the government’s issuance of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government limit the American people’s willingness to rely on the public sector to drive overall economic growth. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\n\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic stimulus while pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government’s debt-finance obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration will work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. But this is no simple task. It is now common knowledge that deficits are growing at $3 million per minute and will accumulate to some $9.1 trillion over the next decade. And our fiscal predicament is compounded by the embedded unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By our calculation at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the present value of the unfunded debt of these two entitlement programs has reached $104 trillion, with $88.9 trillion of that due to Medicare alone.\n\nThe legendary actor Errol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in “reconciling [his] gross habits with [his] net income.” I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their limit of tolerance of the “gross habits” of government and the net new indebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which suggests that, as an antidote to what ails the economy, government spending is a thin reed on which to rely. Given the expected slow adjustment rate of the other components of final demand, my guess is it will be a long time before we see growth strong enough and sustained enough to make an appreciable dent in excess capacity. I envision an output path going forward from here that looks something like a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a near-term snapback from the short, intense downstroke, followed by a transition to a long period of slower growth corresponding to the elongated side of the mark.\n\nNow, mind you, this is what I foresee from my vantage point, standing before you tonight. Yet well before I met Finn Kydland or could afford to collect rare books or was taught economics by Dolly Parton, I took an undergraduate course from John Kenneth Galbraith. Galbraith warned his students that “[T]he only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” My forecast for the economy might be totally wrong. But that is how I see it as a Piscean, and I’m sticking with it.\n\nPeter, thank you. I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions the audience might have."

        "content": "July 23, 2009 Carlsbad, California\n\nIn his upcoming book, In Fed We Trust: Ben Bernanke’s War on the Great Panic, David Wessel of the Wall Street Journal writes that “Fed officials are the Jewish mothers of the global economy. They always have to worry about something …”[1] He also organizes the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) into “cool guys,” “jocks,” “geeks” and “wannabes.” I am classified as one of the “jocks” who, according to Wessel, are “determined to show their manhood by talking tough about inflation and economic rectitude.”[2] So this morning, you are going to hear from a compulsive worrier preoccupied with price stability and monetary integrity.\n\nIf you had turned to page 2 of the Wall Street Journal on Monday, you would have seen a felicitous headline that read, “Fed’s Lending Ebbs as Crisis Subsides.” The leading indicators for June that were released on Monday by the Conference Board do, indeed, hint at a crisis subsiding: The index rose for the third straight month and, in doing so, has registered gains comparable to those seen last in the economic recoveries of 1991 and 2001–02. The index reflected recent increases in residential building permits, a modest increase in the manufacturing workweek, a retreat in initial jobless claims and slight improvement in supplier deliveries. Taken together with other, recent economic data releases, these movements might be viewed as signaling improving conditions in manufacturing and distribution. As to the Fed’s lending, had you suffered through my last few speeches, you would have heard me say that the Federal Reserve had pulled the economy back from the abyss as I reviewed the success of the temporary programs we put in place to revive the functioning of the key credit markets.[3]\n\nThe Journal is right: Our lending from these facilities has ebbed. To update you: At last count, our holdings of commercial paper had been reduced from $350 billion at its peak to $111 billion; the primary dealer credit facility has gone untapped for 10 weeks; overseas central bank borrowing under the swap arrangements we put together at the end of 2007 and significantly expanded afterward is running at a fifth of its peak rate. The term asset-backed securities loan facility, or TALF (which some wags said was too clever by HALF), is still growing but comprises a very small proportion of the Fed’s emergency lending portfolio. And the term auction facility, or TAF—the very first facility we created in December of 2007 to auction significant amounts of discount window credit to primary-credit-eligible depository institutions—is running an average daily balance that is almost half the rate it reached during the fourth quarter of 2008.\n\nSo what’s to worry about?\n\nWell, central bankers always find things to worry over—we are genetically programmed that way. Today I’ll speak of two concerns. The first is the longer-term outlook for the economy. The second has to do with the separate but related problem of the concentration of financial power in the hands of too few institutions and the pathology of too-big-to-fail.\n\nThe Economic Outlook\n\nThe outlook for real activity over the next several quarters is improving. While there is considerable angst regarding the problem of growing unemployment, which in the troughs of the last two recessions was a painful and politically evocative lagging indicator, there are clear signs that the economy is stabilizing and even reviving in critical areas. The mathematics of stabilization is interesting. One of my colleagues at the Dallas Fed calls it “the Johnny Mercer effect,” after the famous Hollywood lyricist who penned the refrain “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive [and] e-lim-i-nate the negative.”\n\nHere is how it works. Residential investment, inventory investment and consumer spending each subtracted more than a percentage point from GDP growth, on average, during the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 (the latest periods for which we have data). The latest monthly indicators suggest that the drag from residential investment has stopped and may even be reversing. Inventory investment is likely to remain negative, but as long as it does not become more negative, it will cease to be a drag on GDP growth. And if the pace of inventory liquidation moderates, you eliminate a powerful negative and begin to accentuate the positive.\n\nAs to consumption, the most prominent of all GDP components: With the exception of the episode in the spring of 1980 when President Carter imposed credit controls, consumption has suffered its biggest two-quarter drop since records began in 1947. But, as Milton Friedman taught us, households adjust the level of their spending quickly as the economic outlook changes, without waiting for the changes to be realized. In other words, they cut their spending as job prospects deteriorate rather than wait for layoffs to actually occur. This means that the worst may well be over for household consumption, barring new bad news. While we do not expect American consumers to come surging back to fuel a global boom any time soon, latest data on personal consumption expenditures and retail sales appear consistent with Friedman’s theory.\n\nIn a similar vein, the latest reports from the Institute for Supply Management show export orders stabilizing as the economies of our overseas trading partners begin to bottom out. Again, we have a reversal of signs and mitigation—if not elimination—of the negative: Falling exports subtracted 3.8 percentage points from GDP growth over fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. Nonresidential fixed investment was nearly as large a drag: 3.6 percentage points. But, as with residential investment, the latest monthly indicators suggest at least a bottoming out and, hopefully, even the beginnings of a rebound.\n\nMeanwhile, government stimulus spending is about to kick in, turning a 0.2-percentage-point drag on GDP growth into a significant plus.\n\nA lot of former negatives are being eliminated. We are seeing changes from negative impulses to slightly positive ones. This accentuates the positive in the aggregate. We probably have the beginnings of a faint recovery.\n\nHow robust and sustainable will the recovery be? There’s the rub—the stuff of concern.\n\nInventory adjustments, while welcome, are of temporary utility. Any boost to growth from inventory investment will be the result of a rebalancing of supply and demand that is inherently transitory. Sustained growth will have to come from somewhere else.\n\nI doubt it will come from housing or a return to the bad old days of financial Bacchanalia. We do not want—and cannot expect—massive foreign capital inflows or domestic investment indifferent to risk to finance another boom in household spending and residential investment. That means we will need to see a massive reallocation of capital and labor away from such formerly hot growth areas as construction and finance. I surmise that this regearing will take time and that, in the interim, households and businesses will focus on shoring up their savings and balance sheets rather than spending money. For consumption, that translates into a slow crawl out of purgatory. For capital expenditures and employment rolls, it means an emphasis on tight budgeting and continued focus on absolute needs rather than wants.\n\nThe needed reallocation of labor and capital has been and will continue to be impeded by financial markets. Although substantially improved from last fall—due in significant part, I would argue, to the work of the Federal Reserve—markets are still a long way from having normalized. We know from our own experience and from the experience of other countries that financial headwinds like these take years to abate.\n\nTo offset those headwinds, the fiscal authorities have stepped forcefully into the breach, putting in place a massive stimulus effort. They have done so to prevent unprecedented year-over-year declines in wage and salary income from translating into falling disposable income—while simultaneously trying to goose up capital expenditures on infrastructure.\n\nIf you go back to the rudimentary formula taught in high school economics to account for the makeup of GDP—consumption plus investment plus government expenditures plus net exports—the “G,” or government, variable is receiving enormous emphasis while “C” is flaccid, “I” is hesitant and net “X” is tentative. At the present rate of government expenditures thus far this year, federal, state and local authorities—net of intragovernmental transfers—are expected to spend $5.6 trillion in 2009, equivalent to 40 percent of expected GDP.\n\nThe problem is that government stabilization measures almost certainly come with a real long-term price tag: higher tax rates, greater collective indebtedness and the prospect of higher interest rates driven by the government’s issuance of debt. These long-term costs of a larger government put a limit on the American people’s willingness to rely on the public sector to drive growth in the overall economy. A fiscal gag reflex ensues, and the public-sector option looks less and less attractive as anything other than a temporary source of growth.\n\nThe major challenge facing U.S. fiscal authorities is meeting the need for near-term economic stimulus while simultaneously pursuing a practicable plan to stabilize the government’s debt-finance obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is doing his level best to reassure investors—both overseas and here at home—that the programs put in place by the Obama administration will work their magic and then be gradually withdrawn as the economy gets back into stride. He will, incidentally, have to square his corners with the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that annual deficits will stay above at least $600 billion a year over the next decade and will require an addition of $9.1 trillion in debt.\n\nErrol Flynn is reported to have quipped that his problem lay in “reconciling [his] gross habits with [his] net income.” I imagine the American public and its representatives are close to their limit of tolerance of the gross “habits” of government and the net new indebtedness they are willing to pass on to their children, all of which means to me that reliance on government spending as an antidote to what ails the economy is a thin reed to rest on. Given the expected slow adjustment rate of the other variables that make for sustainable economic growth, my guess is it will be a long time until we reach a point when that growth will carry on at rates to which we had become accustomed. I envision an economic path forward from here that looks something like a check mark, with the Johnny Mercer effect giving us a snap back as the negative momentum of the short, intense down stroke of the check mark abates and turns upward but then settles into a lower growth slope on the elongated side of the mark.\n\nMind you, one of my professors at Harvard was John Kenneth Galbraith, who warned us that “economic forecasting was created to make astrology look respectable.” I might be totally wrong here. But that is how I see it presently from my perch at the Dallas Fed: Economic growth is likely to be slower in the out years than we have become accustomed to.\n\nThe challenge for the Federal Reserve is to provide needed near-term monetary stimulus while maintaining a credible commitment to long-term price stability. This means (a) distinctly avoiding any perception that we are willing to monetize this or any other administration’s fiscal initiatives, and (b) providing the marketplace with a clear sense of how we will unwind in a timely manner the stop-gap measures that have resulted in a dramatic expansion of our balance sheet.\n\nI want to return to the chart on page 2 of Monday’s Wall Street Journal. While the temporary liquidity programs I mentioned earlier have retracted, our balance sheet has expanded due to the increase in our holdings of securities held outright. Here are the numbers for the past year through last week: The Fed has taken onto its consolidated balance sheet $205 billion in Treasury securities, $102 billion in the debt of Federal agencies and $526 billion in mortgage-backed securities. We presently carry a total of $1.3 trillion in securities held outright, accounting for roughly 63 percent of our total assets.[4] When the Fed acquires securities, the funds enter the banking system and ultimately appear in the reserve accounts held at the Fed by banks and other financial institutions. When these reserves are removed from our balance sheet and lent out to the public, expansion in the money supply and easier credit conditions could ultimately result in inflationary pressures. Mindful of this, concerned parties have asked what our “exit strategy” will be.\n\nChairman Bernanke provided what I thought was a fulsome exposition of our exit arsenal in his semiannual Humphrey–Hawkins testimony (the CliffsNotes version of his presentation was made available in an op-ed in the Journal on Tuesday).[5] He detailed the means by which the FOMC can either directly reduce the stock of reserves or temper the incentive for banks to deploy them into the economy by making it attractive for banks to keep them on deposit at the Fed through higher interest rate payments. We could also drain reserves and excess liquidity by arranging large-scale reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), have the Treasury sell bills to the public to sop up money in the system and place the proceeds on deposit at the Fed and, if necessary, sell outright into the market some of the longer-term securities we hold on the left side of our balance sheet.\n\nI will say no more about this here today; I think the chairman has covered the waterfront on this subject. But I will acknowledge that, yes, to pull the credit markets out of a death spiral, we have taken great risk with the Federal Reserve balance sheet. We never contemplated doing more than the minimum necessary. And we know that we can do too much. For example, while one can argue that by agreeing to purchase up to $300 billion in long-term U.S. Treasuries, the FOMC provided a needed short-term tonic to private credit markets, we dare not come to be viewed as a handmaiden to the Treasury. By loosening the anchor we have established for long-term inflation expectations, we could create the perception that monetary policy is subject to political imperatives, doing lasting damage to our ability to maintain price stability and restore full employment. I believe we have come as close as we dare to the line between acceptable and unacceptable risk in this regard, and do not personally wish for us to expand or extend our purchases of Treasuries beyond the cumulative $300 billion planned by this fall.\n\nTo conclude this little diversion on exit strategy, let me say that I am aware some will argue that laying out our arsenal is not enough; we need to convince markets we have the nerve to deploy it in a timely fashion. Within minutes of the conclusion of the chairman’s testimony, one commentator sent out a client note, later echoed by many others on op-ed pages and on the web, as follows: We now “know the Fed has the bullets, but fear it will not have the guts to pull the trigger.” To a Texan who lives in a gun culture, this is a cute analogy (especially coming from someone who’s Swiss!). But I would not doubt our resolve. We know full well that monetary policy trickles in with a lag and that we will have to “pull the trigger” of tightening policy well before it is politically convenient.\n\nToo Big to Fail\n\nFiscal and monetary authorities today face the additional, special challenge of reforming financial regulation so as to minimize the chances of a future meltdown. Here, again, there is a tension between the short term and the long term. In the short term, once a financial crisis has begun to develop, the natural focus is on limiting the damage—on preventing contagion. A real danger is that in the longer term, the prospect of these government damage-control efforts will lead financial institutions to take inappropriate risks, making the financial sector even more dysfunctional.\n\nThe financial crisis has had some important consequences for the structure of the banking industry—indeed, the financial industry as a whole. We saw the investment banking model largely disappear as some of the major players—Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley—converted to bank holding companies, while some others—Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers—are no longer with us. The restructurings that have taken place have certainly altered the shape of the U.S. banking industry.\n\nA major concern of mine is that all the crisis-related acquisitions we have seen may further consolidate financial assets and power into the hands of a few large organizations, leading ultimately to reduced competition and a less diverse and efficient financial sector. The massive government assistance recently provided to large banks may be artificially tilting the competitive balance in favor of large institutions.\n\nFor example, each of the four largest commercial banking organizations, and others as well, was provided with substantial government assistance during the crisis—all, at least implicitly, in the name of the too-big-to-fail doctrine. As a group, the total asset base of the four has grown 30 percent since June 2007.[6] In contrast, industry assets outside the four have grown a smaller 12 percent.\n\nThat growth reflects acquisitions. Bank of America’s assets grew 51 percent from June 2007 to March 2009, assisted in no small part by its acquisitions of Countrywide Financial and Merrill. Wells Fargo’s asset base grew 138 percent, thanks mainly to its acquisition of Wachovia. J.P. Morgan Chase acquired both Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and grew 43 percent.\n\nThe only institution among the top four that did not grow is Citigroup, whose assets declined almost 20 percent. And here’s an interesting observation: Rough estimates suggest the top four institutions together would have shrunk—not just Citigroup—if not for the acquisitions just mentioned. Taking out the acquired assets, the current top four likely would have shrunk 7 percent as a group over the period in question.\n\nThe acquisitions of troubled banks have worked to perpetuate size concentration in the banking industry. The top four currently control 44 percent of industry assets. If we simply take away from the top four the assets they recently acquired, they would have “only” 30 percent of the industry’s asset base.\n\nIn using acquisitions to resolve the crisis, we may have unwittingly perpetuated one of its root causes—the too-big-to-fail doctrine.\n\nThoughtful critics will point out that too-big-to-fail is economically perverse: There is something inherently anticapitalistic when you have a system that allows banks, their shareholders and creditors to profit when things go well but leaves the taxpayer holding the bag when things turn sour.\n\nThe economist Allan Meltzer likes to say that “capitalism without failure is like religion without sin: It doesn’t work.” In order to have a financial system that remains the fountainhead of credit and the wherewithal for business men and women to bring forth new ideas and products and create employment, we must have a dynamic system that rewards winners rather than coddles losers, that incentivizes prudent behavior and harshly penalizes imprudent behavior.\n\nMy colleague Gary Stern—the outgoing president of the Minneapolis Fed who literally wrote the book on TBTF (too big to fail)—recently gave a speech that pulled no punches on this front. He said (a) “it is striking that most of the losses suffered to date during the financial crisis have been at the largest institutions operating in the country,” (b) the problem of too-big-to-fail was “not … addressed effectively by the FDICIA legislation of 1991 [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act]” and (c) “creditors of such [large] complex financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers’ motivations, protection if failure threatened.”[7] Thus incentivized, management of these institutions took excessive risk, and the market underpriced that risk. And it follows in President Stern’s mind, as it does in mine, that unless incentives are focused upon in seeking to cure the problem of TBTF, we will not only fail to address this most troublesome pathology but may make it worse.\n\nStern argues that the Treasury proposal now on the table to correct the problem “fails” in regard to corralling incentives for managers of large institutions to repeat the errors for which the public has recently paid so dearly. Here is his punch line: “I would describe the Treasury plan … as ‘status quo plus’—[with] more capital, more liquidity, better supervision, [and] far-reaching resolution authority for the largest institutions. [But] [t]here is little reason to think that these steps will … succeed in reining in TBTF effectively over time because they do not change the incentives which create the problem. In fact,’’ Stern concludes, “there is nothing in the Treasury proposal designed to put creditors of large, systemically important financial institutions at risk of loss. … [T]he Treasury proposal … leaves the financial system considerably more vulnerable …”[8]\n\nAs we grapple with TBTF and with the overall regulatory treatment of so-called Tier 1 institutions, we are going to have to bear Gary Stern’s criticism in mind. The only way to ensure a robust financial system is to enforce a system that marries risk-taking to consequences and see to it that the consequences for mismanagement are loss of managerial positions and the capital of shareholders and creditors, including uninsured depositors, rather than a second chance that only further concentrates financial power.\n\nThis is important—not only to ensure a more efficient economic system but to better facilitate the implementation of monetary policy. The extent and duration of the extraordinary steps taken by those of us at the Fed are complicated by the prolonged existence of financial institutions that fall into this troublesome category.\n\nBanks that are too big to fail exacerbate business and credit cycles. In the good times, these institutions use excessive leverage and their cost-of-funds advantage to grow more rapidly than smaller banks. Expansionary monetary policy is then given a boost as these institutions grow at eye-popping rates.\n\nBut what happens when financial conditions worsen? Too-big-to-fail banks must de-lever, shrinking their asset books and, in general, swimming against the tide of easier monetary policy. As the weak capital position of these institutions becomes widely recognized, they find it difficult and costly to raise funds. A weakened financial system with several of these banks will induce a flight to quality, increasing credit spreads and interest rates at a time when the Fed is attempting to do just the opposite. This slows economic growth, reducing asset values and overall wealth as credit availability deteriorates further. An adverse-feedback loop is created, working in direct opposition to the policy efforts of the central bank.\n\nThe existence of financial institutions that are too big to fail dramatically impacts the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. The blockages they create—in credit markets and on balance sheets throughout the economy—compound our travails by making it more difficult to get the timing and dosage of monetary policy “right.” They reduce the effectiveness of our traditional tools, introducing a need for special liquidity and credit facilities that are difficult to unwind.\n\nI know my opinions on this subject will hardly endear me to the largest financial institutions. On his death bed, Voltaire (who was neither a Hollywood lyricist nor a movie actor nor the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis) was asked to renounce the devil. He is said to have replied that this was no time for making new enemies. Some think that during this time of crisis and with financial and economic recovery still so tenuous, it is not the right time to think about proposals that make the perfect the enemy of the good. I disagree. I believe we need to “think long,” as the Californian George Shultz likes to say, and the current policy prescription for treatment of TBTF is a bit shortsighted or, at best, necessary but not sufficient. If we want to avoid a repeat of what has just happened over the past 18 months, we need to exorcise the notion that an institution is too big to fail and remove all incentives for any institution to risk infecting the health of the financial system. If we make some enemies in the process, so be it. The object is to get it right.\n\nThank you. I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have."

        "content": "May 28, 2009 Washington, D.C.\n\nI want to thank the Washington Association of Money Managers for having me here this evening and Fred Boos for that kind introduction. Thank you also for allowing two of my best friends, Evan Thomas and the Reverend Derrick Harkins, to join me tonight.\n\nNeither Evan nor Derrick is a money manager. Evan is editor-at-large of Newsweek and is one of the great American nonfiction writers. He wrote The Wise Men and one of the great biographies of Bobby Kennedy. Yet, as an Annapolis man, I love him best for his work on John Paul Jones—the father of the American Navy. But that is not why he is here tonight. We are \"cousins\" through marriage: Both he and my wife, Nancy, descend from the family tree of Norman Thomas, a Presbyterian minister who ran for the presidency six times as a socialist and pacifist. Evan is here because in a most nonpacifist manner, he plans to dispatch with me on the golf course this weekend and wants to make amends ex ante.\n\nI shall appeal to Reverend Harkins for some ex ante divine intervention in Saturday's match! Derrick leads the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church and has been my pastor for many years, going back to when he led the New Hope Baptist Church in Dallas. He is one of our country's most eloquent preachers, and I am honored that he is here.\n\nWith such a distinguished man of the cloth present among this group of people dedicated to the pursuit of mammon, I thought I would give a little sermonette this evening.\n\nHere are four quotes from financial scripture:\n\nThe first is from Charles Mackay's Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions, written in 1841:\n\nThe second is taken from the father of central banking—Walter Bagehot—from his essay \"Edward Gibbon,\" in the 1856 edition of National Review:\n\nFrom Liaquat Ahamed, who has written a superbly entertaining book, published earlier this year, titled Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World:\n\nFinally, Paul Volcker as quoted in Bill Neikirk's Volcker: Portrait of the Money Man in 1987:\n\nTonight, I will reference each of those passages as we explore where we have been, where we are today and the fiscal predicament that awaits us further down the road. But first, some context.\n\nReverend Harkins will no doubt have heard the story of the humble Presbyterian pastor who visited a shelter where he found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. This generous pastor took pity upon the man. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store for a pair of shoes, a shirt, a tie and a new suit. The pastor then dropped the man back at the shelter, handed him $20 and told him, \"Son, you have been saved. My church is just one block away from here. I want you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.\"\n\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the pastor went to the shelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed, reading a newspaper. \"Son, I had asked you to come to my church this morning to give testimony to having been saved. Where were you?\" asked the pastor.\n\n\"Pastor,\" the man replied, \"I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my whiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this new suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So I used the $20 to take a cab to the Episcopal church.\"\n\nI certainly don't need to tell a room full of Washington money managers what got the nation into its current economic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly heaven-sent and the short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on the road, not to salvation, but to economic perdition.\n\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at least two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial reorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new capacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the global economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and communication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating globalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The world was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new sources of funds as well as new places to invest.\n\nEasy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low for too long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on enhancing returns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free rates—\"craved\" and \"devoured\" new risk instruments, to paraphrase Bagehot. As a result, they came up with new \"schemes\" and \"projects\" and \"phantasies\" made more enticing by expanded markets and financial innovation.\n\nShort-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker and lender, the time-tested principle of \"know your customer\" took a back seat to the mad rush to package and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, \"living within your means\" became a less compelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial gain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to mathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\n\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay and Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles through history—prevailed. A \"plethora\" of commercial and financial opportunity begat \"speculative\" excess that inevitably begat a \"panic.\" The thundering \"herd,\" spurred on by \"the love of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation\" and \"mad\" with irrational exuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had \"devoured\" more risk than it could stomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into recession.\n\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know the answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against \"the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds, the Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells[1] and the rest of the undeserving group, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives of men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.\"\n\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman Brothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis or John Thain for \"Sunshine Charlie\" Mitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve \"banksters,\" you will have captured the liturgy of invective heard from Father Coughlin's contemporary secular cousins. Nothing is new under the sun; old prejudices and conspiracy theories never die.[2] On airwaves and in the blogosphere, on editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign parliaments, critics are casting about for whom to blame for \"shackl(ing) the lives of men\" and women from Bethesda to Beijing with the \"ponderous links\" that took us to the very edge of the abyss of global economic collapse.\n\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal Reserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke, my colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend the system.\n\nI believe that the initiatives taken by the Federal Reserve prevented us from falling into the chasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we confronted a total breakdown of the financial system. Having announced our extension of term lending to banks in December, in rapid order, we then set in motion a series of steps to provide liquidity, strengthen the security of certain banks, become the equivalent of market maker for key financial instruments such as commercial paper and certain asset-backed securities and, in ways appropriate to the times, deliver on our mandate as lender of last resort.\n\nYou are all familiar with the efforts taken by the Federal Reserve to these ends. I won't review them program by program this evening. I think it fair to say that with these actions the Federal Reserve has done everything in its power to avoid making the modern equivalent of the \"misjudgments\" that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in the 1930s (and, I should add parenthetically, that everyone and their brother feel Japan made in the 1990s).\n\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the economy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some \"green shoots\" beginning to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery. This is not to be Pollyannaish or imply that these sprouts are spreading like kudzu. But the knock-on effect of the Fed's direct efforts does seem to have reignited animal spirits in markets that had been frozen. The commercial paper market has been revived. Mortgage rates have declined significantly. Issuance of corporate bonds has become robust. The premium over Treasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has fallen by more than 35 percent since peaking last December. The same can be said of higher risk bonds as well as jumbo mortgages—all markets considered to be at the far end of the risk spectrum. This round-trip back from last fall's unprecedented flight to quality is also reflected in the stock market, as equity markets have coursed upward and volatility has diminished.\n\nWhile it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the broad economy, I am pleased to see a reaction on Main Street: The most recent reports indicate that purchasing managers see an abatement in the pace of decline in new orders; manufacturers surveyed by the Kansas City, Philadelphia, Richmond and Dallas Feds, to varying degrees, report a moderation in their previous rates of decline in activity;[3] retail sales are no longer plunging; and, as all of you heard from the Conference Board on Tuesday, consumers' assessment of the economy over the next six months—driven primarily by slowing job losses—appears to be less pessimistic.\n\nThese are encouraging signs. But, to be sure, we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nCompared with the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter results for the nation's largest banks are encouraging, yet obvious challenges remain. Confidence among business women and men—the creators of lasting, productive jobs and prosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains elusive. Consumers at home remain cautious, for fear of losing their homes or their jobs. The markets we sell into abroad—Mexico and Europe, for example—remain strikingly weak, while others such as China are perhaps more robust but are insufficiently sized to fill the hole left by consumers at home and in our larger export markets.[4]\n\nUnder these conditions, I have been forecasting a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback—nor even a U-shaped one—but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix between consumption, savings and investment. It is worth recalling that employment did not reach its nadir until 21 months after the end of the 2001 recession, though headwinds then were not nearly as severe as those we face today.\n\nYou know the numbers that have been reported for the nation for the first quarter: Even after upcoming revisions, I venture we will find we contracted at somewhere between an annualized 5 and 6 percent. The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we are likely to bounce along the bottom for a while. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way before the end of the year. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while mitigated by the expansion of government (particularly the need for census takers), will likely take us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we reverse course. And global excess capacity is likely to remain excessive for some time to come.\n\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack worldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek. Indeed, the recent pressures have been to the deflationary side. As evidenced in the Dallas Fed's most recent manufacturing survey, firms receiving lower prices for their goods outnumbered those receiving higher prices 11-to-1, although firms do expect deflationary pressures to begin subsiding.[5]\n\nNeither deflation nor inflation engenders confidence. Both distort the decisionmaking of households as well as businesses. Both inhibit sustainable employment growth. If you want to know the outlook for inflation over the next quarter or next year, look at current domestic and global slack: It is doubtful that inflation will raise its ugly head until employment and capacity utilization tighten. Looking further out, however, Milton Friedman—who, in keeping with the theme of this evening, I suppose I could safely refer to as the Moses of monetary policy—reminds us that inflation, defined as \"a steady and sustained rise in prices,\" is \"always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\"[6] Bearing this in mind, we must be careful with the deployment of our monetary initiatives.\n\nAs the nation's central bank, the Fed performs two major roles, in addition to its regulatory duties. One is the standard conduct of monetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest rates and the money supply to achieve our long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable employment.\n\nThe Fed's other role is, as mentioned, to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial markets when confidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and dysfunctional. This entails targeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire circumstances. Reflecting the larger role of securities markets in funding loans, the Federal Reserve has extended its lender of last resort role beyond banks. Since the fall of 2007, the Federal Reserve has been aggressive in putting programs in place to revive the functioning of key credit markets and pull the economy away from the brink. I point to the term auction (TAF) and commercial paper (CPFF) facilities as examples of initiatives that have worked as planned by the FOMC and are now shrinking in size. These actions are not permanent injections of money that may later fuel inflation, but rather are temporary injections of liquidity to stabilize malfunctioning markets. As such, they are intended to promote financial stability, sustainable growth and price stability.\n\nCongress, spurred on by the new president, has been aggressive with fiscal policy. The good news is that if fiscal policy has been properly designed—and time will tell if it has been—it should propel the economy farther away from the edge and put it on its way to a new cycle of economic growth, somewhat tentatively at first but hopefully gathering momentum as time passes.\n\nUnfortunately, that momentum faces a real, long-term threat: storm clouds on the horizon in the form of daunting fiscal imbalances.\n\nThat deficits will be high over the next few years seems clear, with a $1.8 trillion deficit expected this year and $3.8 trillion in new debt issuance now forecast over the next five years. Perhaps more important, annual deficits exceeding half a trillion dollars are projected for at least 10 years into the future, emphasizing that we as a nation will continue to spend considerably more than we take in long after the current economic crisis.\n\nThe country's major newspapers recently reported with great urgency the administration's finding that Social Security would begin spending more than it takes in by 2016—seven short years from now. Left unreported was the fact that the discounted present value of entitlement debt, over the infinite horizon, reached $104 trillion.[7] This is almost eight times the annual gross domestic product of the United States—and almost 20 times the size of the debt our government is expected to accumulate between 2009 and 2014.\n\nMost of this entitlement shortfall comes from Medicare rather than Social Security. As you may know, Medicare has three main components: Part A for hospital stays, Part B for doctor visits and Part D for prescription drugs. The fiscal shortfall for Part A alone is $36.4 trillion—about one third of all entitlement debt. Part B's shortfall is just a tad larger, clocking in at $37 trillion. Part D—the latest addition to the Medicare program—registers a shortfall of $15.5 trillion. And Social Security, the program about which various reforms have been so frequently mooted in recent years, registers a deficit of $15.1 trillion—only one seventh of the total unfunded liability from entitlement programs.\n\nThis is the fiscal predicament to which I alluded earlier—a looming budgetary threat to our long-term economic prosperity. And while the announcement that the Social Security trust fund will begin its decline one year earlier is an important fiscal event, the swelling of overall entitlement debt to more than one hundred trillion dollars has far more serious implications for economic growth—implications we are poorly positioned to address given the budget deficits we face today.\n\nOur successor generations are coming to grips with this daunting reality. Faced with the prospect of a government that they believe may be unable to deliver on its promise of long-term fiscal balance—particularly with regard to entitlement programs—these individuals might logically begin to alter their consumption patterns, spending less today to save more for tomorrow. There is nothing wrong with increasing savings. But, in an economy driven by consumption, this intertemporal hedging may dampen the pace of future economic growth.\n\nOf course, any student of history knows that throughout time, governments unwilling to face the music and fund their liabilities have turned to monetary authorities to print their way out of their predicament. We all know by heart the pathologies that afflicted Weimar Germany, Argentina and other countries. And we have daily reminders from bond vigilantes like Bill Gross about the prospect of losing our AAA rating. This cannot be allowed to happen in America. Which is why I am pleased to see that the new administration has embraced what was hitherto perceived as the third rail of American politics and brought the issue of unfunded entitlement liabilities to the fore. For the sake of our grandchildren, I hope that the administration and the Congress will take this vexing beast of a problem by the horns and tame it.\n\nAgainst that background, it is important that monetary policymakers be especially sensitive to concerns voiced about the dramatic expansion of the Fed's balance sheet in an era of high deficits. I return to the Book of Ahamed and the Book of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the miscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the Fed cannot monetize deficits without heightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the future course of interest rates.\n\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations in mind. We have been very careful to calibrate our actions so as to accommodate the needs of credit markets and the economy—not political imperatives. We are well aware that some of our balance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a few eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase if necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while it is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve, the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries—a decision made to improve the tone in private credit markets—has been viewed by some as skating a little too close to the edge of political accommodation.\n\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can also tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any longer and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit markets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak, we are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way.\n\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the Treasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue just over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book of Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as monetizing debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent guardian against, future inflation and drive real interest rates higher.\n\nYou may wish to note that, press and analysts' reports to the contrary, a keen student of the H.4.1 and the Foreign and International Monetary Authority (FIMA) custody holdings reports of the Fed will detect that foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasuries and agencies have been growing at a robust pace, not shrinking. And from what I can detect from the activity of so-called indirect bidders in Treasury auctions—indirect bidders submit competitive bids through others rather than directly; central banks are among those who commonly bid indirectly—there continues to be strong demand for longer duration Treasuries—again, contrary to rumors and press reports. Thus, to date, our actions have not given rise to concern that we will violate Paul's Dictum.\n\nThis is important, for there are concerns in some quarters that the Federal Reserve will be politicized. For example, there have been suggestions that Congress should be involved in the selection of Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who, unlike the seven members of the Board of Governors, are not appointed by the president nor confirmed by the Senate. I trust that Congress will resist this initiative and not upset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the interests of Main Street with those of Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist the urgings of some to accommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\n\nYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the FOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I think we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the time-tested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous, always bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound, mission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\n\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me speak to you tonight. I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you have."

        "content": "May 15, 2009 San Antonio, Texas\n\nI have just read to you four passages from financial scripture. In this morning’s sermon, I plan to make reference to each of those passages as we explore where we have been and where we might be headed.\n\nBut first, I want to thank the Texas Bankers Association for having me here this morning and Victor Pierson, the honorable mayor of Jamaica Beach and president of Moody National Bank, for that kind introduction. Besides being pivotal in the organization of the TBA some 125 years ago, the Moody family has played a rich role in the life of Texas since well before that time (a fulsome history I heard often—always accompanied with a wry sense of humor—from old Dan Oppenheimer back in the 1980s). The lineal and business and banking descendents of Col. William L. Moody have navigated hurricanes, wars, depressions and banking crises—all of epic proportions—and have always remained standing. They are a monument to Texas resilience. It is an honor to be introduced by anybody associated with the Moody legacy.\n\nNow to the sermon.\n\nI once managed Dan Oppenheimer’s personal portfolio. One afternoon in 1982, I was visiting Dan at the Oppenheimer Bank here in San Antonio. A Baptist preacher came in to ask him for a “loan.”[1] He wanted to buy some cattle. Dan was teasing him about the prosperity he had achieved while preaching from the pulpit and warned him not to count on its permanence. “Your congregation might become as prominent as you,” he said, “and then migrate to a nicer church.” To illustrate the point, he invented a story about a Baptist preacher who visited a shelter where he found a man who looked particularly downtrodden. The generous preacher took pity upon the man. He took him to a barber for a shave and a haircut and to a store for a pair of shoes, a shirt, a tie and a new suit. The preacher then dropped the man back at the shelter, handed him $20 and told him, “Son, you have been saved. The Baptist church is just one block away from here. I want you to come to my church on Sunday and praise the Lord.”\n\nSunday came but the man did not. So immediately after the service, the preacher went to the shelter. There was the man, sitting in a rocking chair, all dressed up and beautifully groomed, reading a newspaper. “Son, I had asked you to come to the Baptist church this morning to give testimony to having been saved. Where were you?” asked the preacher.\n\n“Pastor,” the man replied, “I surely did go to church. I woke up this morning, shaved my whiskers, combed my hair, put on this beautiful shirt and tie you bought me and dressed in this new suit. I put on these fancy new shoes. When I looked in the mirror, I felt like a millionaire. So I spent the $20 and took a cab to the Episcopal church.”\n\nI certainly don’t need to tell a room full of Texas bankers what got the nation into its current economic situation. A sudden new set of circumstances, easy money seemingly heaven-sent and the short-sighted suspension of time-tested, prudent financial practice led us on the road, not to salvation, but to economic perdition.\n\nAllow me to address each of these individually.\n\nThe new set of circumstances included the economic and financial windfalls that came from at least two major structural changes. The first was the end of the Cold War and the commercial reorientation of China, Vietnam, India and Eastern Europe, which unleashed enormous new capacity for the increased production of goods and services, held down costs and restructured the global economic map. The second was the explosion of computational power and communication ease that came from technological advancement and the Internet, facilitating globalization and leapfrogging frontiers that formerly separated the economic landscape. The world was our oyster. It simultaneously gave us new consumers and suppliers. It provided new sources of funds as well as new places to invest.\n\nThe easy money may well have been encouraged by central banks that held interest rates too low for too long. But it was exacerbated by lenders, investors and consumers who—keen on enhancing returns that seemed pedestrian with a flat yield curve anchored by low, risk-free rates—“craved” and “devoured” new risk instruments. As a result, they came up with new “schemes” and “projects” and “phantasies” made more enticing by expanded markets and financial innovation.\n\nThe short-sightedness was manifest in the abandonment of prudential practices. For the banker and lender, the time-tested principle of “know your customer” took a back seat to the mad rush to package and sell exposure to others. For the consumer, living within your means became a less compelling discipline in a world where a house was not just a home but a means to financial gain. For the investor, prudence took on another dimension with the presumed ability to mathematize judgment and hedge away the risk of default.\n\nAnd yet, while the world had indeed changed, the behavioral pathology documented by Mackay and Bagehot in the 19th century—a pathology based on their studies of countless debacles through history—prevailed. A “plethora” of commercial and financial opportunity begat “speculative” excess that inevitably begat a “panic.” The thundering “herd,” spurred on by “the love of gain, the necessity of excitement or mere force of imitation” and “mad” with irrational exuberance for the upside, suddenly realized in 2008 it had “devoured” more risk than it could stomach and panicked. The financial system seized up and the economy descended into recession.\n\nWho is to blame? Well, if you had been listening to the radio on Feb. 26, 1933, you would know the answer. You would have heard a crazed Father Charles Coughlin, pastor of the Shrine of the Little Flower in Royal Oak, Mich., rail against “the Morgans, the Kuhn-Loebs, the Rothschilds, the Dillon-Reads, the Federal Reserve banksters, the Mitchells [2] and the rest of the undeserving group, who without … the blood of patriotism … flowing in their veins have shackled the lives of men and of nations with the ponderous links of their golden chain.”\n\nAdvance the tape 76 years. If you substitute Goldman Sachs for the Rothschilds, Lehman Brothers for Kuhn-Loeb, AIG for Dillon Read, Ken Lewis, Sandy Weill or John Thain for “Sunshine Charlie” Mitchell and keep the text about Federal Reserve “banksters,” you will have captured the liturgy of invective heard from Father Coughlin’s contemporary secular cousins. On airwaves and in the blogosphere, on editorial pages and even in the halls of Congress and foreign parliaments, critics have been casting about for whom to blame for “shackl(ing) the lives of men” and women from Bastrop to Beijing with the “ponderous links” that took us to the very edge of the abyss of global economic collapse.\n\nI will let you draw your own conclusions about who is to blame. In my time at the Federal Reserve, starting in 2005 and working predominantly under the chairmanship of Ben Bernanke, my colleagues and I have been focused primarily on finding a way to undo past errors and mend the system.\n\nI believe that the initiatives taken by my fellow “banksters” at the Federal Reserve prevented us from falling into the chasm of an economic depression. Beginning in August of 2007, we confronted a total breakdown of the financial system. In rapid order, we undertook a series of steps. We:\n\n—Created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds;\n\n—Initiated new measures in cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to strengthen the security of certain banks;\n\n—Undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system;\n\n—Began to pay interest on bank reserves;\n\n—Announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, then increased that sum to $200 billion;\n\n—Announced we would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae, then increased that sum to $1.25 trillion;\n\n—Announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility which we have since stated we were prepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned $200 billion to $1 trillion; and\n\n—Began the process of purchasing up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities between March and September to help improve conditions in private credit markets.\n\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent, a process I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nIn summary, the Federal Reserve did everything in its power to avoid making the modern equivalent of the “misjudgments” that Liaquat Ahamed argues were made by our predecessors in the 1930s (and, I should add parenthetically, that everyone and their sister feel Japan made in the 1990s).\n\nThere is evidence that our actions have succeeded in pulling the financial markets and the economy from the edge of the abyss. There are, as many have noted, some “green shoots” that have begun to sprout that will help end the contraction in output and set the stage for a recovery. In the world of finance, interest rates in key areas such as mortgages and the London interbank market have declined dramatically, enlivening the housing markets and reviving interbank lending; private bond market issuance has resumed and, indeed as you will see in this week and next week’s issuance calendar, at robust levels for both high-grade and junk issuers; and the stock market has rallied from its lows, bringing with it a surge in the volume of new stock issuance. While it takes some time for these improved financial conditions to start helping the broad economy, I am happy to see that some green shoots are also starting to emerge on Main Street: The most recent reports indicate that job losses may be slowing; trucking companies—a group often looked to as a leading indicator—report a slight pickup in sales; purchasing managers are reporting that the pace of decline in new orders has abated; and retail sales are getting slightly less worse.\n\nThese are encouraging signs. But we are not out of the woods. We have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nFirst quarter results for the nation’s largest banks are encouraging, but challenges remain. Confidence among business women and men—the creators of lasting, productive jobs and prosperity—has shown signs of revival but remains elusive.

The pace of decline will moderate in the current quarter, and then we’re likely to bounce along the bottom for a while, perhaps punching through to positive growth as 2010 dawns. I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way any earlier. Regardless, increases in unemployment, while mitigated by the expansion of government (particularly the need for census takers) will likely take us to a 10 percent jobless rate before we reverse course. And global excess capacity is likely to remain excessive for some time to come.\n\nAs to price stability—the touchstone of central banking—given the vast amount of slack worldwide, the near-term outlook for inflation is meek.

One is the standard conduct of monetary policy—a blunt instrument of adjusting interest rates and the money supply to achieve our long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable employment. In performing that role, the Fed has lowered short-term interest rates to help cushion the economic downturn.\n\nThe Fed’s other role is to act as a lender of last resort—to stabilize financial markets when confidence breaks down and markets become unduly segmented and dysfunctional. This entails targeted injections of liquidity to keep markets functioning under dire circumstances.

I return to the Book of Ahamed and the Book of Volcker. Ahamed speaks of the miscalculations of policymakers. Volcker warns that the Fed cannot monetize deficits without heightening fears of inflation and negatively impacting the future course of interest rates.\n\nThose of us responsible for developing monetary policy must constantly bear both observations in mind.

We are well aware that some of our balance sheet additions, designed to pull markets and the economy from the edge, have raised a few eyebrows (like the $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities we have pledged to purchase if necessary—although it has unquestionably driven mortgage rates to historic lows). And while it is not unusual for the System Open Market Account to buy Treasuries along the yield curve, the FOMC’s decision to purchase $300 billion in U.S. Treasuries—a decision made to improve the tone in the private credit markets—has been viewed by some as skating a little too close to the edge of political accommodation.\n\nI can tell you that the FOMC is well aware of the doubts being voiced about its intentions. I can also tell you that nobody I know on the committee wants to maintain our current posture for any longer and to any greater degree than is minimally necessary to restore the efficacy of the credit markets and buttress economic recovery without inflationary consequences. Indeed, as I speak, we are studying ways to unwind our balance sheet in a timely way. Chairman Bernanke spoke of this just this past Monday in Georgia.\n\nIn the meantime, looming before us is the prospect of a heavy calendar of debt issuance by the Treasury. Between now and the end of the current fiscal year in October, the Treasury will issue just over $1 trillion in net new debt, with at least that much to follow in fiscal 2010. As the Book of Volcker warns, the Federal Open Market Committee can ill afford to be perceived as monetizing that debt, lest we come to be viewed as an agent of, rather than an independent guardian against, future inflation.\n\nAlready, there are concerns that the Federal Reserve will be politicized. For example, some have called for increased congressional involvement in the selection of Federal Reserve policymakers and a reduced role for member banks. I trust that the Congress will resist this initiative and not upset the careful federation that has for so long balanced the interests of Main Street with those of Washington, just as we at the Federal Reserve must resist the urgings of some to accommodate the short-term financing needs of the Treasury.\n\nYour central bank has worked hard to pull the economy back from the abyss. To be sure, the FOMC has taken risks to do so. We have no doubt erred on occasion, but for the most part, I think we have gotten it right—primarily because each of us has an abiding faith in the time-tested virtues of conducting responsible monetary policy. We will work hard to remain virtuous, always bearing in mind that our job is to conduct monetary policy with the simple, yet profound, mission of underpinning sustainable economic growth without sacrificing price stability.\n\nSo much for the Gospel according to the Dallas Fed! Thank you for letting me be here. Thank you for letting me serve you. And thank you for letting me tell one of my favorite stories about old Dan Oppenheimer, God rest his witty old banker’s soul.\n\nIn true central banking fashion, I will now do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you have."

        "content": "April 17, 2009 Beijing, China\n\nThank you. I am delighted to be here at Tsinghua University, together with my colleagues, Mark Wynne, who is director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and Tao Wu, a Hubei-born senior economist and policy advisor at the Dallas Fed.\n\nI may have the longest experience in China not only of any Federal Reserve official, but perhaps of any American policymaker you will ever meet! My native Australian father and South African-born mother sailed out of Shanghai on the S.S. President Wilson just as the port was being shut down by the soon-to-be victorious forces of the Communist revolutionaries in 1948. In a story too long to tell here, my father had been dispatched to collect a dollar payment owed an American company—the Spazier Chemical and Soap Company. They left Shanghai for the U.S. with more than the money due Spazier: My mother was with child—me—and I was born the following March.\n\nSo my bona fides for standing at this lectern at this prestigious university in Beijing to discuss the economic predicament of the United States (and the Federal Reserve’s response) in a globalized world are as follows: I was assembled by an Australian–South African consortium in China, then shipped across the Pacific to become one of the innumerable factors that make for a dynamic economy that is uniquely American. When I served my government as an ambassador and trade representative in negotiating the bilateral aspects of your country’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Madame Wu Yi once told me, “Of course you have done well in America. You were manufactured in China!”\n\nThirty years after my date of “manufacture,” I served in the Carter administration as coordinator of policy planning and assistant to Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal. Secretary Blumenthal brought me to China in 1979. I mention this for a reason. That early experience in China, coupled with my involvement 20 years later as deputy U.S. trade representative in negotiating China’s accession to the WTO for President Clinton, forms the lens through which I now view China’s success, challenges and potential.\n\nI am going to anchor my remarks today with some perspectives gained from that trip to China in 1979. Then I will turn to the economic situation of the United States and the Federal Reserve’s response, in keeping with our duties as the central bank of the largest economy in the world. Finally, I will endeavor to answer any questions you wish to ask.\n\nThroughout, please bear in mind that I am a Texan. Texans speak plainly and directly. In an academic setting like Tsinghua, I trust you will consider my candor as keeping fully in the spirit of intellectual exchange.\n\nA Short Historical Perspective\nPresident Nixon famously normalized political relations with China in his meetings with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in 1972. It fell to President Carter, however, to settle the counterclaims between the U.S. and China that stemmed from the Communist takeover in 1949. Chairman Mao’s forces did not seize the cash of Spazier Chemical and Soap, but they did seize the railroad stock and other assets the U.S. had lent to the Nationalist government; the U.S. government, in turn, retaliated by freezing China’s accounts in U.S. banks. Without settling those counterclaims, we could not normally trade with each other. So after months of rigorous preparation, at the behest of President Carter, Secretary Blumenthal and his team, including me as the secretary’s faithful chef de cabinet, dispatched to Beijing on Feb. 23, 1979, to settle the claims. We met with Secretary Blumenthal’s official counterpart, Finance Minister Zhang Jin-fu, then with Deng Xiaoping and Chairman Hua Guofeng.[1] We sealed the preliminary deal on March 1, after arduous negotiations with Deng, and that day officially raised the flag over the American Embassy in Beijing, establishing the fulsome diplomatic presence of the United States in China.\n\nThe memories of that trip flooded back as I prepared for today’s lecture.\n\nWhen we landed in Beijing on Saturday night, Feb. 24, 1979, our delegation was whisked off to the official guesthouse in Red Flag limousines. The roads into Beijing had no cars—not because the route had been cordoned off for our delegation but because there simply weren’t any. What traffic we did see included skinny horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, exhaust-spewing trucks and countless bicycles made in the Forever bicycle factory in Shanghai for the purpose of realizing Zhou’s “four modernizations.”\n\nThat was my first hands-on impression of China: There were no cars. Imagine that! Now, 30 years later, anybody attempting to navigate Chang’an Avenue on a bicycle would be taking his life in his hands. Beijing alone has over 2.5 million cars, and China overall roughly 40 million.\n\nAfter we reached the initial agreement to settle our claims, we flew to Shanghai on a People’s Liberation Army plane for a little R&R before returning to Beijing to tidy up some fine points and sign our accord. Your government had thoughtfully picked out the prettiest military women they could muster to serve us drinks and meals on the flight. On a whim, my counterpart and seat mate from the State Department, Robert Hormats, who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, took out a Polaroid camera and took a picture of these impromptu flight attendants. You would have thought he had struck a match in some far corner of the world where fire had never been seen. The flight attendants squealed with delight, and the entire crew, including the pilots, came to the back of the plane to examine this previously unseen, newfangled technology that allowed photographs to develop after only a minute or so. Think about that. This was roughly a quarter century after Polaroid had become commonplace in the U.S. and four years after the first user-friendly personal computer was brought to market by Steve Jobs and the Apple Corporation. Yet, the Chinese public had never seen an “instant” camera, let alone heard of a personal computer.\n\nPolaroid has since filed for bankruptcy, having been overtaken by microprocessor-driven electronic cameras and photo-capable cell phones. Today, China annually produces roughly 100 million microcomputers, and it has 650 million domestic cell phone subscribers. Your country has become the world’s largest producer of semiconductors and the leading exporter of information technology goods.\n\nWhich brings me to China’s willingness to adopt and adapt. When Deng Xiaoping entered the room for the initial encounter with our delegation in the Great Hall of the People, he cackled, “Where are these big American capitalists we Chinese are supposed to be so afraid of?” During our meeting, he made a remark that paralleled his famous “black cat, white cat” theme—“it doesn’t matter if the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.” Deng’s remarks encapsulated the importance of practical results over political correctness and economic development over ideological purity—both hallmarks of modern China. Deng made it clear to our delegation that China was intent on modernization and that the Chinese cat would be focused on catching droves of economic mice as it engaged the rest of the world, starting with the inputs and access from trade that would be liberated with our settlement that week.\n\nThis China has done. In 1979, the U.S. imported a mere $595 million from China under onerous tariffs; the Chinese did not have a single dollar in official reserves. Now, you send more than $300 billion in goods annually to the U.S. and hold on the order of $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, a majority component of which are U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Until recently, since Deng’s ascendancy, China has grown its economy at around 10 percent per annum, has become the world’s pivotal factory and is quickly moving to the cutting edge of technology.\n\nIt is worth noting that Deng and his successors’ approach to modernization differed from that of Japan. A contemporary of Deng Xiaoping told me that in a conversation with him in 1978, Deng had decided that, unlike Japan’s decision to utilize national champions to build its economy and then engage the world to leverage Japanese prosperity, the Singapore model of attracting the best and brightest from around the world up front would better pave the way for domestic development and quick growth. Thus, from the get-go, China has had an inherent stake in the success of globalization.\n\nOne final impression from that trip in 1979: During that trip, we were treated to a soiree in the Great Hall of the People on Feb. 27. The seventh act of the evening was a piano recital—a performance of Liszt’s “Hungarian Fantasy No. 6”—by a pianist named Liu Shikun. Today, Liu is regarded as China’s finest pianist; he has performed worldwide, including with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony for one of the best-selling classical music albums of all time. He had given his premiere performance at the age of 5. In 1949, at the age of 10, he had won the Chinese National Competition for Teenagers and Children. In 1956, at the age of 17, he was so brilliant in his performances around the world that the Hungarian government presented him with a lock of Liszt’s hair. He was a boy wonder, a musical genius who won innumerable international competitions worldwide.\n\nIf you read Liu’s official Chinese biography, you will note that “he has performed in front of several generations of Chinese statesmen, including Mao Zedong … Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao.” What it does not tell you is that he was imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution and, we were told, maintained his skills by carving a keyboard on the wall of his cell and playing it day after day, hearing its music only in his imagination. His performance for us that February evening in 1979 was one of his first public appearances since his “rehabilitation,” and it was so stirring that even our Chinese hosts were moved to tears.\n\nWhenever I contemplate China’s capacity to succeed in the global economy, I think of those first impressions of China of 30 years ago—the paucity of automobiles and the absence of computers; the determination of Deng Xiaoping to harness the best talent and techniques from all over the world; the example of the triumph over misguided policy that is embodied in the spirit and genius of Liu Shikun. And I conclude that as long as China continues to constructively engage the rest of the world and allow the tremendous talent of the Chinese people to flourish, the People’s Republic will not only be able to withstand the setbacks currently afflicting the global economy, but will continue to advance its standing as an economic juggernaut.\n\nOf course, in a globalized economy, we are all interdependent. To prosper, China needs and expects the largest economy of the world to overcome its economic and financial travails and lead the way to a global economic recovery. So let me now give you a briefing on the current U.S. situation.\n\nThe Present Situation\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we will have again contracted at a dispiriting rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising. We currently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could surpass 10 percent by year-end. Even in Texas, the most dynamic of the American states and the only large province in the U.S. to create jobs last year, we expect unemployment to rise, though not to national levels.\n\nAmong other things, this has compounded the problem of the much-watched housing market, where many of the problems we have encountered in our financial markets germinated: The most recent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price declines accelerated in the 20 metropolitan districts tracked. Prices fell 19 percent on a year-over-year basis for the three-month period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is more pervasive. The men and women who operate our businesses and create and sustain employment have assumed an uncharacteristic defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they are doing the best they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost of labor), and running tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most necessary capital expenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy in stasis. Presently, nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\n\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the growth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as agricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that global trade will contract by 6.1 percent in 2009.[2] The WTO is forecasting a 9 percent contraction.[3] This will be the first time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized retrenchment of global economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S. economy.\n\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, considered to be the father of the (American) Constitution, wrote that “the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.”[4] There is presently a palpable lack of circulating confidence in the business community in America. Only when confidence is restored will the U.S. economy begin to grow again.\n\nCapital is the basis of capitalism. Without efficiently operating credit markets, the muscles of the economic body—private businesses that produce goods and services and employ workers and are the engines of prosperity—cannot function. Thus, the Federal Reserve has assumed a dramatically proactive and highly innovative role in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit markets while stemming economic decline. This is an unaccustomed thing for our central bank. Ordinarily, the men and women of the Federal Reserve are the most shy and modest of economic agents. We prefer to move incrementally rather than exponentially, and we have historically treasured conducting our deliberations quietly and away from the public limelight. But confronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an implosion in our economy, in rapid order we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely broadcast initiatives. Over a period of a little more than a year, we:\n\nAnd, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more as we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\n\nThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n\nI understand these concerns. Especially from a Chinese perspective. Just as the effects of the arduous work and admirable thrift of the Chinese people are coming into fruition, your largest export market and source of much investment—the United States—enters a bone-crushing recession. And simultaneously, the largest and most liquid market for investing the hard-earned savings and reserves you have accumulated have become extraordinarily volatile.\n\nIt would be only natural for your leaders to wonder if the remedies we are applying to treat our economic pathology might eventually result in inflation and depreciation of the dollar.\n\nSo let me address each of these concerns in order.\n\nFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to conduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently, the risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And we seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or a debasement of our currency.\n\nI have a reputation for being the most “hawkish” participant in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee. I do not particularly like ornithological nomenclature—I would rather be considered a wise owl (and I certainly do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon). But I have a record that substantiates that “hawkish” reputation, having voted five times against monetary accommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I consider inflation an evil spirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be countenanced. But it is clear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a serious threat given the pervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising unemployment, the widespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity market corrections, continually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic condition of the banking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a global economy groaning with excess capacity.\n\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability[5] (that is to say, the next couple of years), the problem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\n\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollar-denominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are atypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And we are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets that we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy. We realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and agency paper such as your government and others in the Asian-Pacific region.\n\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using the new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29 percent against the British pound. Against the major reserve currencies, the dollar has depreciated against only one, the yen, and by 2 percent.\n\nHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Chinese investor had purchased a three-month U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of this past month, the return would have been a negative 1.5 percent. That is hardly inspiring. But, had that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central government bond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent.\n\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would have enjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yuan terms, 10-year euro sovereigns would have earned a return of negative 11.6 percent over the past year. The equivalent return would have been a positive 9.5 percent for the Chinese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I may paraphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new tools, it has been quite true that “gentlemen prefer American bonds.”\n\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in dollar-denominated public debt due to the profound actions taken by the Federal Reserve have proven unfounded.\n\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new supply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus $788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.[6] All things being equal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative returns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the problems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial than those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain as an example of a euro-area economy that led the European pack on the upside and now is cascading rapidly downhill. In the case of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and political predicament they are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for Treasuries and other official paper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their attractiveness relative to alternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less, attractive under most reasonable future scenarios.\n\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by investing in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced. These policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for permanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do, they will engender growth of the economy and concomitant confidence in both the fixed-income and equity markets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence boosted in the path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget projections. If these policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction within fixed-income markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to readjust their fiscal policies.\n\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James Carville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to be the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or emperor or pope but as the bond market, for “[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.”[7] I suspect this respect for the power of bond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\n\nOf course, to maintain price stability and faith in the dollar, we must maintain the independence of our central bank, the Federal Reserve. The dangers that arise when monetary authorities become the handmaidens of political authorities are documented in countless historical examples—from the fall of ancient Rome to the Weimar Republic in Germany to the Nationalist Chinese government in the 1940s to modern Zimbabwe. In 2013, we will celebrate our 100th anniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an ongoing entity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of China. This is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this business. We seek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we must zealously guard our ongoing independence.\n\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the goals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.[8] In this endeavor, it is the Federal Reserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize the impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet of the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets on its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit markets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another way, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary consequences of its balance sheet growth.\n\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current financial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have been faced with far tougher tasks and have always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of our making. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we always come roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233 years, the people of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of creative destruction that economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any economy, be it built upon Anglo-American or Asian-Pacific or any other principles.\n\nOur recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy and adaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in the early 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble—humility is, after all, anathema to Texans—but I think it reasonable to consider our track record and our adaptability to be the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new levels of prosperity. I am confident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve will facilitate and, indeed, expedite the recovery process. In doing so, we will serve not only the interests of the United States but also those of China. For without restoration of American prosperity, China cannot realize the successful accomplishment of the course I personally witnessed Deng Xiaoping initiate—a course his successors have so assiduously built upon and are working so hard to complete.\n\nNow, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my utmost to avoid answering any questions you may have. That’s a joke. I will be glad to answer questions in a straightforward manner for as long as you wish to ask them."

        "content": "April 8, 2009 Tokyo, Japan\n\nDomo. Thank you. I am delighted to be here, together with my colleague Mark Wynne, who is the director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.\n\nI first came to Japan with President Carter for the G-7 Summit hosted by Prime Minister Ohira in June of 1979. That experience whetted my appetite for Japanese culture. So after I returned to the private sector and had established an investment management firm in Dallas, I came back with my family to reside in Tokyo under the aegis of the Japan Society for most of 1990—arriving here shortly after the Nikkei Dow reached its all-time peak of 38,915. This gave me an invaluable opportunity to simultaneously learn about your country while providing my colleagues at Fisher Capital Management in Dallas insights into a financial market reversal of epic proportions—insights gleaned from an office kindly provided me by Nomura Research as well as from the bleachers on the various baseball fields where my teenage son played for the Minato Moose team in the Tokyo Senior Boys Spring League.[2]\n\nSeven years later, I rejoined the government and served President Clinton as deputy U.S. trade representative in numerous bilateral negotiations with your government. I also served as cochair with Deputy Foreign Minister Haraguchi of the multiyear, joint commission set up by Prime Minister Hashimoto and President Clinton on deregulation and competition. In this commission, we wrestled with everything from laws governing retail stores to electricity distribution to bid rigging in construction to financial deregulation and even what I referred to then as “mini-micro” issues—ranging from auditing standards to regulations governing law firms. I consider it a significant accomplishment for both sides that, today, one of the few issues from that agenda that remain unresolved is the matter of providing a level playing field for private insurance companies as they seek to compete with Japan Post Life Insurance, which like the rest of the Postal Savings system is now in a 10-year process of privatization.\n\nToday I have the honor of speaking to you in another capacity—as a representative of the central bank of the United States in my role as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, one of the Federal Reserve’s 12 operating banks.\n\nEach of the bank presidents participates in the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body that sets monetary policy for the United States. The tradition of the Federal Reserve is that each member of the FOMC speaks only for himself or herself. I shall adhere to that tradition today. The observations I will offer today are my own and should be interpreted as a view only from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—nothing more.\n\nI have been fortunate to see both my own country and yours from several perspectives. I have learned enough about Japan from my different experiences here and my amateur study of Japanese history and literature to know that I do not know much. The first Western interpretation of Japan that I remember taking to heart was that of Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote of “the immense difficulty of perceiving and comprehending what underlies the surface of Japanese life.”[3] I have worked with your government on trade issues, operated an investment fund from Tokyo, watched innumerable Japanese baseball games (I confess, at great risk in this audience of likely Giants fans, to being a fan of the Yakult Swallows, and even though they haven’t won a championship since 2001, I am hoping this 40th anniversary season for their franchise will be their lucky charm), read and re-read the classic works of Western interpreters like Hearn and [Edwin] Reischauer and [Karel] van Wolferen (and, my favorite as a baseball fan, Robert Whiting!) and studied the works of literary giants like Natsume Soseki and Tanizaki Jun’ichiro.[4] But I have barely scratched the surface of comprehending your rich and complex culture. These experiences have taught me enough, however, to be humble when addressing a Japanese audience of this distinction. So rather than prescribe policy to you, I will stick to describing the policy predicaments in which my own countrymen and women are immersed.\n\nOne of my favorite books in Japanese literature is Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro, a gorgeous novel written in 1914, two years after the death of the Emperor Meiji and two years before the author’s own death. Lafcadio Hearn offered what seems to me to be the best translation of the word kokoro—he defined it as “the heart of things.” In this lecture, I shall try to quickly get to the heart of things occurring in the U.S. economy. I will then summarize the consequences for U.S. monetary policy. And then, if you permit me, I will endeavor to answer any questions you might have. Throughout, I will do my best to achieve the stylistic simplicity that Soseki-san achieved in Kokoro, though undoubtedly without the beauty that is implicit in that novel, for there is little of apparent beauty in our current economic and financial situation.\n\nThe data from the United States are grim. Our economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. I expect that when the numbers are properly tallied, we will have contracted at a very similar rate in the quarter just ended. Unemployment is rising. We currently have roughly 13.2 million people without jobs, which equates to an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent. I expect the unemployment rate to continue rising to a level that could surpass 10 percent by year-end. Among other things, this has compounded the problem of the much-watched housing market, where many of the problems we have encountered in our financial markets germinated: The most recent release of the Case-Shiller index reveals that home price declines accelerated in the 20 metropolitan districts tracked, falling 19 percent on a year-over-year basis for the three-month period ended in January. But the problem with our economy is more pervasive. The men and women who operate our businesses and create and sustain employment have assumed a defensive crouch. Confronted by dyspeptic financial markets, they are doing the best they can to preserve their margins by cutting costs (most significantly, the cost of labor), and running tight inventories, rationalizing supply lines, deferring all but the most necessary capital expenditures and, in general, avoiding risk. The result is an American economy in stasis. Nothing is being ventured, and nothing is being gained.\n\nOf course, not helping matters is the implosion of our export markets, which are vital to the growth of an economy positioned to sell high-value-added goods and services—as well as agricultural and other basic goods—to others. The World Bank is predicting that the global economy will contract by 1.7 percent this year, and global trade by 6.1 percent.[5] This will be the first time since the 1940s that we have witnessed such a deep and synchronized retrenchment of global economic activity, and this makes tougher the task of growing the U.S. economy.\n\nOne of our founding fathers, James Madison, a coauthor of the Federalist Papers and considered by many to be the father of the (American) Constitution, wrote that “the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money.”[6] There is presently a palpable lack of circulating confidence in the business community in America.\n\nIn light of this, the Federal Reserve has assumed a dramatically proactive and highly innovative role in seeking to restore vibrancy in the credit markets while stemming economic decline. This is an unaccustomed thing for our central bank. Ordinarily, the men and women of the Federal Reserve are the most shy and modest of economic agents. We prefer to move incrementally rather than exponentially, and we have historically treasured conducting our deliberations quietly and away from the public limelight. But confronted with a dysfunctional financial market and an implosion in our economy, in rapid order we have undertaken a series of very visible and widely broadcast initiatives. Over a period of a little more than a year, we:\n\nAnd, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate we charge banks to borrow from our discount windows, so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we will grow our balance sheet even more as we complete our programs of purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nBy being so proactive in straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the central bank of the largest economy in the world, and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability.\n\nThis expansion of our balance sheet has given rise to concerns that we may be:\n\nI understand these concerns. And I have actively and loudly argued during deliberations of the FOMC that these risks represent a real and present danger. But I am here to tell you that I am not alone. The committee members—from the regional bankers like me to its chairman, Ben Bernanke, and other governors—are each and every one determined not to violate the basic tenets of Federal Reserve sanctity.\n\nLet me address each of these concerns in order.\n\nFirst, with regard to the potential inflationary consequences of our actions: Our assignment is to conduct monetary policy so as to engender sustainable, noninflationary job growth. Presently, the risk is deflationary job destruction. We have undertaken measures to counter that risk. And we seek to do so in a way that will not ignite the embers of either a future destructive inflation or a debasement of our currency.\n\nI have a reputation for being the most “hawkish” participant in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee, and I have a record that substantiates that reputation, having voted five times against further accommodation during the commodity-driven price boom of 2008. I consider inflation an evil spirit that rots the core of economic prosperity and must never, ever be countenanced. But it is clear to me that in this environment, inflation is unlikely to present a serious threat given the pervasive bias in the U.S. economy toward wage cuts and freezes, rising unemployment, the widespread loss in wealth that has resulted from both the housing and equity market corrections, continually declining consumption and business investment, and the anemic condition of the banking and credit system, all of which reinforce downside price pressures in a global economy groaning with excess capacity.\n\nFor as far ahead as I trust my forecasting ability (that is to say, the next couple of years), the problem with regard to maintaining price stability most certainly is not inflation.\n\nWith regard to the fate of the dollar and the willingness of others to continue purchasing dollar-denominated debt, we realize that by purchasing Treasuries in volumes and of durations that are atypical, we are at risk of being perceived as monetizing the fiscal largesse of our Congress. And we are acutely aware that by intervening in the mortgage-backed securities and other markets that we are at risk of being perceived as blurring the lines between fiscal and monetary policy. We realize that this may give rise to some apprehension among large holders of Treasuries and agency paper such as your government and others in the Asian Pacific region.\n\nAnd yet, let me remind you that over the past year since we began in earnest the process of using the new tools I have just articulated, the dollar has appreciated 17 percent against the euro and 29 percent against the British pound. Among the major currencies, the dollar has depreciated against only one currency, Japan’s, and by 2.4 percent.\n\nHere are some numbers for you to contemplate: If a Japanese investor had purchased a three-month U.S. Treasury bill in March 2008 and rolled it over every three months until the end of this past month, the return would have been slim to none—about –1.4 percent. That is hardly inspiring. But, had that same investor purchased and rolled over a three-month euro-area central government bond, the investment would have resulted in a loss of 16 percent. A Chinese investor investing in euro bonds would have had the same experience. A Korean investor investing in the same manner would have earned a return of 21 percent in euros but would have earned a 42 percent return in won terms had he invested in three-month Treasury bills.\n\nCertainly for the past year to date, fears of debasement of fixed-income portfolios invested in dollar-denominated public debt have proven unfounded. To be sure, an investment in comparable maturities in yen would have earned a modest positive return of 0.47 percent for a Japanese investor. But, adjusted for liquidity, that is hardly sufficient incentive for not having a predominance of the world’s most significant currency in a portfolio.\n\nI would add that a foreign investor who moved out on the Treasury yield curve would have enjoyed superior returns to those just cited. In yen terms, 10-year sovereign Japanese paper earned a return of 2 percent from March of 2008 to March of this year. Ten-year euro sovereigns would have earned a return of negative 11.5 percent in yen terms. The equivalent return would have been a positive 10.4 percent for the Japanese investor in 10-year U.S. Treasuries. If I may paraphrase Andrew Mellon, at least for the period over which the Fed has been applying its new tools, it has been quite true that “gentlemen prefer American bonds.”\n\nBut that is in the past. As to the future, the underlying math becomes more complex: The net new supply of Treasury debt is predicted to expand by $2.5 trillion in the current fiscal year, versus $788 billion in the last fiscal year and only $145 billion in fiscal year 2007.[7] All things being equal, this would result in a move upward in yield and downward in price, providing negative returns absent any foreign exchange factor. But all things are not equal. For starters, the problems facing the largest competitive currency, the euro, are perhaps even more substantial than those confronting the United States. I will point to Spain and Ireland as examples of euro-area economies that led the European pack on the upside and now are cascading rapidly downhill. In the case of Japan, you are as aware as anybody of the economic and fiscal and political predicament you are faced with; I will say no more. My point is that demand for Treasuries and other official paper of U.S. government issuers will be determined by their attractiveness relative to alternatives, and they may well be judged more, rather than less, attractive under most reasonable future scenarios.\n\nMoreover, both the fate of budget imbalances and the potential for total returns earned by investing in U.S. securities depend on the efficacy of the fiscal policies Congress has advanced. These policies are designed to jump-start the economy while laying the groundwork for permanent structural reform. Time will tell if they achieve this multipurpose goal. If they do, they will engender economic growth and concomitant confidence in the fixed-income and equity markets for private securities. In addition, tax flows will be restored and confidence boosted in the path of deficit reduction envisioned by the current administration in its budget projections. If these policies don’t jump-start the economy, then I am confident that the reaction within fixed-income markets will force those with the power to tax and spend, the Congress, to readjust their fiscal policies.\n\nI offer as evidence the revelation that came to the fiercely partisan Democratic operative James Carville during the Clinton administration. He said that were he to be reincarnated and wished to be the most powerful of all, he would come back not as a president or a pope but as the bond market, for “[the bond market] can intimidate anybody.”[8] I suspect this respect for the power of bond markets remains true for the Obama administration and the current Congress.\n\nAs to the independence of the Federal Reserve, let me remind you that in 2013, we will celebrate our 100th anniversary as the central bank of the United States. We are not as established as an ongoing entity as the Bank of England, nor as young as institutions such as the People’s Bank of China. This is not to say we are superior or always exemplary, but we are an elder in this business. We seek to be worthy of the veneration traditionally given to an elder. To this end, we feel it necessary to guard our ongoing independence.\n\nWe have recently agreed with the U.S. Treasury to an accord to work together to support the goals of preserving both monetary and financial stability.[9] In this endeavor, it is the Federal Reserve’s job to maintain monetary stability, while the Treasury will enable the Fed to sterilize the impacts of its lending and securities purchases on its balance sheet—and on the balance sheet of the banking system. In essence, the Federal Reserve will not monetize the growth of the assets on its balance sheet that has been, and will continue to be, necessary to jump-start the credit markets that are so essential to the recovery of the U.S. and global economies. To put it another way, the Federal Reserve is in the process of acquiring the tools to short-circuit any inflationary consequences of its balance sheet growth.\n\nIn contemplating the future of the American economy and our ability to overcome our current financial predicament, I take great comfort in knowing that we have faced far tougher tasks and have always accomplished them. It is true that we Americans often confront storms of our making. We occasionally falter and get blown off course. But we never give up. And we always come roaring back stronger, leaner and more efficient than we were before. For 233 years, the people of the United States have demonstrated that they are masters of the process of creative destruction that the economist Joseph Schumpeter articulated as the key to success for any economy. Our recent presidential election demonstrates that we are still possessed of a vibrancy and adaptability that the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville found so inspiring in the early 19th century. As an American, I may be insufficiently humble, but I consider our track record and our adaptability the stuff of an eventual recovery that will take my country to new levels of prosperity. I am confident that the innovative policies being pursued by the Federal Reserve will facilitate and, indeed, expedite the recovery process.\n\nOne of the unique cultural artifacts that I found intriguing while I was here in Japan in 1990 was the senninbari. For the Western press that is here, these are the “thousand stitch cloths” that originated during the Sino-Japanese War. By tradition, they consisted of a strip of white cloth embellished with 1,000 French stitches sewn with red thread by a thousand women and given to soldiers to ward off bullets and ensure a safe return. There should be no doubt that we at the Federal Reserve, like central bankers everywhere, are subject to attack by the bullets of a severe global recession and financial turbulence. Perhaps we could use senninbari to protect us. But as symbolically and emotionally meaningful as they might have been, senninbari were no substitute for prudent maneuvering on the battlefield. As part of the team working very hard to successfully maneuver our central bank through the current financial battlefield, my colleagues and I are committed to the utmost to conducting monetary policy not only so as to ward off the bullets and other threats to our economy but to emerge from this stressful period with an American economy that is stronger and better and that plays an important role in renewing the vibrancy of the global economy.\n\nAnd now, in the tradition that is the hallmark of central bankers everywhere, I will do my best to avoid answering any questions you may have.\n\nGoseichou arigato gozaimashita. Thank you very much."

        "content": "March 26, 2009 Dayton, Ohio\n\nEnough of this dismal stuff.\n\nI want to now put on my hat as a former investor and address the purpose of this conference: identifying investment strategies and opportunities.\n\nI opened with reference to Queen Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis.\" To be sure, 2008 might not have been the only \"annus horribilis\" we will have. It might well be extended to a biennium as we work to untie the Gordian knot of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. However glum you may feel, I remind you that the queen's reference was a play on words from a poem written in the year 1667 by John Dryden, titled \"Annus Mirabilis\"—the \"Year of Miracles\"—about the period of 1665 to 1666.\n\nGet this: The \"Year of Miracles\" that Dryden wrote about began with the Great Plague of London—a pandemic of something akin to bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned London for five days.\n\nSo why did Dryden call it the \"Year of Miracles?\" Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our task is to turn the current \"annus horribilis\" into an opportunity, just as the Brits did 350 years ago—to emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who face a far lesser challenge and have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it now. Turning something \"horribilis\" into a thing that is \"mirabilis\" is the American thing to do.\n\nViewed from this perspective, the current economic and financial predicament represents a potential gold mine rather than a mine field. Historically, great investors have made their money by climbing a wall of worry rather than letting a woeful consensus cow them.\n\nHere is a take-home quote from Charles Mackay's classic tome Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, written in 1841: \"Men think in herds … [and] they go mad in herds.\" Just as the astute investor should have resisted joining the thundering herd's mad euphoria, I suggest you resist joining in the current stampede of despair.\n\nBe ever mindful of the power of economic Darwinism, of what the great economist Joseph Schumpeter called \"creative destruction.\"\n\nWhile today's economic equivalent of brontosaurus die a slow death or are eventually dismantled by regulators, new, more adaptable replacements will emerge. Your job as investors is to identify the new, rather than mourn the old, to ferret out from the general market malaise good financial and business operators whose franchises and prospects are overdiscounted at current prices.\n\nWere I you—were I in my old business of being a market operator and investor—I would be licking my chops at the opportunities that always abound in times of adversity, while those who got too big or too dysfunctional lick their wounds.\n\nIn the parlance of the trade, there are a lot of dollar bills that can be found in the debris of the current markets that can be picked up for nickels and dimes.\n\nGo out and pick 'em up.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "March 4, 2009 Fort Worth, Texas\n\nThank you, Dan [Petty]. Dan and I go way, way back. I have enjoyed his friendship for over 30 years, from when we were just young pups in the Dallas Assembly and numerous other fora. I am always honored to be in Dan's presence, let alone to be introduced by him.\n\nThese are tough, challenging times for business men and women like you, central bankers like me, and for the legislators in Washington whom we collectively entrust with the power to tax and spend our hard-earned money—money whose purchasing power my colleagues at the Fed and I are duty bound to preserve and grow.\n\nIn preparing my talk for you today, I thought of a phrase coined by Queen Elizabeth II in her speech in 1992 marking the 40th anniversary of her accession to the throne. You may remember that that was the year when a series of personal tragedies, including the burning of Windsor Castle, beset her family. With classic British understatement, she told her subjects: \"1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure.… It has turned out to be an 'Annus Horribilis.'\" [1]\n\nFor all of us on this side of \"the Pond,\" this past year, 2008, was an annus horribilis—a truly horrible year that only a sadist could look back upon with pleasure.\n\nI want to talk to you today about what has happened and what we at the Federal Reserve are doing about it.\n\nYou all know the events that have transpired; I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data.\n\nOur gross domestic product shrank at an annualized pace of 6.2 percent in the final quarter of 2008. Even here in Texas, we saw our economy shrink in the fourth quarter. Abroad, the European Union's economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent, England's by 5.9 percent, Japan's by 12.7 percent and Korea's by 20.6 percent. And China's growth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest neighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico's economy contracted, as did that of Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer debt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\n\nAll indicators thus far point to our economy being on track for a decline of roughly the same magnitude in the first quarter of 2009. Just last month, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January and that overall manufacturing output declined 12.9 percent over the past year. And while the pace of contraction seems to have slowed somewhat, the Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that this broad-based manufacturing decline has officially continued through the first two months of 2009. Mind you, it is worse elsewhere. Japanese industrial production in the first three months of 2009 is expected to be 33 percent lower than it was one year ago. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed Tokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan's industrial production. We might call this the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\n\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors, to investors, and to business operators. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and hysterically volatile; it closed yesterday roughly 55 percent off its October 2007 peak. British stocks are off 40-some-odd percent over the same period, the German DAX and the Hang Seng Index are down over 50 percent, and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down almost 60 percent.\n\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit markets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of labor by aggressively cutting \"head count.\" They are delaying capital expenditures, tightening inventory management and demanding that suppliers cut their prices. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man, provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when 'the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n\n\"Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n\"Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No 'operation' is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n\"Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.\"[2]\n\nThat was not written this past year by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous \"Crayon Papers\" about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had never heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called \"irrational exuberance\" is replaced by irrational un-exuberance—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, \"Cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\n\nIn normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species. In times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae; and (8) we announced, and just this Monday fleshed out, a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration—a facility which we have since stated we were prepared to expand significantly to other types of securities and beyond our originally planned $200 billion to $1 trillion, if needed.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the Federal Open Market Committee reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of one percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on aging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money and are now earning meager returns on their fixed income portfolios and bank deposits). Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our \"discount window\" so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to roughly $2 trillion—more than a twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that the new facilities we have created will improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Professor Friedman or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation's central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that our financial system has become and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has risen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the A1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has also not escaped my attention that, while still quite high, the premium over Treasuries that some investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined substantially from its December peak, as has that for noninvestment-grade borrowers. In addition, corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation's economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending the American people's money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes have been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by President Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only time will tell if the stimulus, and the $3.5 trillion budget that has been proposed by the President for the coming fiscal year, will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without spooking the financial markets and/or encumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle that is America, and be executed, as Thomas Friedman reminded us recently in the New York Times, in a manner that encourages winners rather than \"bailing out losers.\"[3]\n\nI trust the Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind both the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply our own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a mandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation, and maintain price stability.\n\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress, there is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this firsthand when I served in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in ancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\n\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it, he notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the Reichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, is reported to have \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[4]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. The Fed under Paul Volcker's leadership was certainly a \"nuisance,\" but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone alive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of economic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\n\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by venturing an opinion on another area where our lawmakers must exercise critical leadership: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including disguised protectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, \"buy American\" provisions and restrictions on capital flows. What made the Great Depression regrettably \"great\" was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the aforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany's free trade policy and acquiesce to the growing demands of manufacturers and rural farmers for increased tariff protection. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform and eventually signed into law the tariff of 1890.\n\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.[5] It provides a temporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a taciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives, newly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nEnough of this dismal stuff. I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another sourpuss like seemingly all the economists and the pundits that you read in the papers or watch on television. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I believe deep in my soul that when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion, no matter how great the challenge.\n\nI opened with reference to Queen Elizabeth's \"annus horribilis.\" 2008 might not have been the only \"annus horribilis\" we will have. It might well be extended to a biennium as we work to untie the Gordian knot of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. However glum or \"lower-lipped\" you may feel, I remind you that the queen's reference was a play on words from a poem written in the year 1667 by John Dryden, titled \"Annus Mirabilis\"—the \"Year of Miracles\"—about the period of 1665 to 1666.\n\nGet this: The \"Year of Miracles\" that Dryden wrote about began with the Great Plague of London—a pandemic of something akin to bubonic plague—and ended with the Great Fire that burned London for five days.\n\nSo why did Dryden call it the \"Year of Miracles?\" Because from the wreckage, London rebuilt itself and arose from the ashes with wide streets, modern sewers and buildings commissioned by Charles II and designed by the great architect Christopher Wren that were so solidly constructed they last to this day. Our task is to turn the current \"annus horribilis\" into an opportunity, just as the Brits did 350 years ago—to emerge from the current economic wreckage stronger and better and more resilient than ever. If England could do it in the 17th century, we Americans, who face a far lesser challenge and have never, ever flinched from staring down and overcoming adversity, can certainly do it now. Turning something \"horribilis\" into a thing that is \"mirabilis\" is the American thing to do. We had best get on with it.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "February 23, 2009 Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nThank you, Dean [David] Ellwood. Nancy and I are proud of our almost 40-year involvement with Harvard College and the Kennedy School and are especially grateful that our four children were blessed with a Harvard education.\n\nI am delighted to see so many friends from our various stages of Harvard life here tonight. I am tremendously honored to give this Albert H. Gordon Lecture. Al Gordon is 105 years old and an exemplar to us all—especially to stock pickers. I am told that on his birthday five years ago, he quipped that, having reached 100, he was \"going to split, two for one.\" The world would have been doubly enriched had he been able to do so.\n\nThis is humbling in more ways than one. Yesterday morning, as I got on the plane to fly up here, I turned to Nancy and said, \"In your wildest dreams did you ever envision me following in the footsteps of Mikhail Gorbachev, George H. W. Bush, David Rockefeller and Ban Ki-moon in giving the Gordon Lecture at the Kennedy School?\" And she replied, \"I hate to let you down, Richard, but after 35 years of marriage, you rarely appear in my wildest dreams.\"\n\nCertainly, few of us imagined in our wildest dreams that our global economy could have turned so rotten so quickly. Only yesterday, it appeared that the economy was cruising along in the most tranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock market closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the housing market but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and various consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\n\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no longer growing but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008, a figure likely to be revised downward after greater scrutiny. Even Texas, the only large state in the United States to have employment growth last year, saw its economy shrink in the fourth quarter. Abroad, the European Union's economy declined at an annualized rate of 5.8 percent, England's by 5.9 percent, Japan's by 12.7 percent and Korea's by 20.6 percent. And China's growth tapered down significantly to a reported year-over-year rate of 6.8 percent. Our closest neighbors saw their economies shift into reverse gear: Mexico's economy contracted, as did that of Canada, a net oil exporter with a surplus in its federal budget, low corporate and consumer debt levels, and no apparent subprime mortgage problems.\n\nLast Wednesday, we learned that U.S. industrial production declined by 1.8 percent in January and that overall manufacturing output has declined 12.9 percent over the past year. It is worse elsewhere. For example, Japanese industrial production is en route to declining by 30 percent this year. For historical perspective, you may recall that in the classic 1954 film, Godzilla destroyed Tokyo, which then represented roughly a third of Japan's industrial production. We might call this the Godzilla Economy: It presents a monstrous challenge.\n\nThis challenge is vexing to bankers and other creditors. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional, and as for stocks, the S&P 500 Index has become historically and hysterically volatile; it closed today roughly 50 percent off its October 2007 peak. British stocks are off 40 percent over the same period, the German DAX is down 49 percent, the Hang Seng Index is down 55 percent and the Nikkei Dow for Japan is down 57 percent.\n\nI will not venture to predict the future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with unforgiving stock and credit markets, American businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting \"head count\" so aggressively that unemployment appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent. Businesses are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices and are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men. Yet, I believe the following, written by another wise man, provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when 'the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n\n\"Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n\"Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No 'operation' is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n\"Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.\"[1]\n\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous \"Crayon Papers\" about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had never heard of Bernie Madoff or Allen Stanford. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called \"irrational exuberance\" is replaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied, \"cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\n\nOf course, we could have let nature run its course for fear of making things worse. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that \"there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.\" But my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who still have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the economy's lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the 19th century by two men: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its governor as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[2]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[3]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and 'to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\" you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of recent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours of the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the theories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\n\nI recently read Ken Follett's magnificent book World Without End.[4]. It is a massive tome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing.[5] While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old orthodoxy of studying the \"humors,\" of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua (\"Thy will be done\"), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of \"fiat voluntas tua.\" We believe in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have been neither \"scanty nor slow\" in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system. We have \"lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.\" And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to the \"zero bound\"—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\n\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient debacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by other lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as the Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the actions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to their banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest rate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the system.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, a facility which last week we stated we were prepared to expand significantly beyond our originally planned $200 billion; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and a quarter of 1 percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the immediate inflationary tide was ebbing (though I remain concerned about the effects low rates have on aging baby boomers and the elderly who played by the rules, saved and squirreled away money and are now earning meager returns on their fixed-income portfolios and bank deposits). Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our discount window so as to lower the cost of credit to the economy.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to $1.75 trillion—an almost twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value of our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. Simple accounting dictates that the expansion of the left side of our balance sheet has been accompanied by an equally impressive expansion of the right side—the liability side. In this regard, the combination of banks' balances, Federal Reserve Bank notes and U.S. Treasury balances has grown tremendously.\n\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the liability side of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash. The bulk of this accumulation was associated with an increase in government securities on the left side of the Bank's balance sheet, which seemed to do little to rejuvenate the system.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In the parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to \"quantitative easing.\" It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese counterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others' unsuccessful attempts at curing the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, mostly short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devices his protagonist, the felicitously named Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn to Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein, it was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B), thereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting perch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby wiping face.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter Bagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation's central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware that the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of Treasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and, by most everyone's accounting, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.[6] This \"guesstimation\" is based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and the expected price tag for the recently approved fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the bank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury and before accounting for the budget about to be sent to Congress by President Obama). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be very careful to avoid any perception that it stands ready to monetize exploding fiscal deficits, as this would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our commitment to long-term price stability. These concerns certainly do not preclude some Treasuries purchases, however, as we seek to strengthen the economy in this time of crisis. With short-term Treasury rates near zero, an argument can be made that buying longer-term Treasuries would be especially effective in this regard.\n\nParenthetically, I would note that such purchases are not at all unusual. We routinely buy Treasury issues with a wide range of maturities in order to maintain a well-balanced portfolio. So, we are talking only about a possible change in emphasis here, not a sharp departure from past practice. That said, in my opinion, we certainly shouldn't try to peg long-term rates. Past efforts to do so soon have led to costly credit-market distortions and inevitably ended in tears. In my view, we must be very careful not to provide for an unsustainable and potentially disruptive distortion in the benchmark market for Treasuries through any extraordinary efforts above and beyond our normal balancing operations.\n\nSimilarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in the market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are the absolute minimum needed, and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind our interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our task is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\n\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym Libor, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on Libor. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities helped reduce the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to a record low of 4.96 in mid-January, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer-term Treasuries has risen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the A1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has also not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 25 percent for non-investment-grade borrowers and that corporate bond issuance has stepped up.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation's economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending the American people's money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes have been on the stimulus package recently passed by the House and Senate and signed by President Obama. This was no easy task, and it was accomplished with unusual alacrity. Only time will tell if the stimulus will give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without encumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle that is America. Next, our political leaders must agree to the funding, if any, of the Treasury's proposals for the resolution of the banking crisis so as to make the system more stable and viable—a resolution, as Thomas Friedman reminds us in Sunday's New York Times, that needs to be done in a manner that encourages winners rather than \"bailing out losers.\"[7] And, on top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have dug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are already on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson's foundation calculates at $56 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe total over $99 trillion.[8] If you do the numbers, you will find that some 85 percent of those unfunded liabilities is due to Medicare; a budgetary Heimlich maneuver is urgently needed to keep Medicare from choking off our economic prosperity.\n\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully plot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and grandchildren.\n\nWhen George Shultz was director of the Office of Management and Budget, he became frustrated with the spending impulses of the Nixon administration. He reports that he called the venerable Sam Cohen, a virtual encyclopedia of budgetary history, into his office and asked, \"Between you and me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?\" Cohen's reply was classic: \"Sir, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.\"\n\nMr. Cohen might have been a more \"equal opportunity\" wisecracker were he still around. No matter. We are beyond the point of either party's placing its immediate political needs ahead of the welfare of our children and successor generations. I am hopeful that the good people that President Obama has assembled to guide his economic policy, and the leadership of the House and Senate, will begin to prevail on Congress to finally begin filling in the gaping holes of unfunded liabilities. In my eyes, these unfunded programs represent the greatest threat to our long-term economic welfare and—given the historical temptation for politicians to ask central banks to monetize their profligacy—the independence of the Federal Reserve. Left unattended, these liabilities will surely tear asunder future American prosperity.\n\nI trust Congress will get it right. And, in doing so, I trust that they—and you—will keep in mind both the limited powers of the Federal Reserve and the vital importance of allowing us to apply our own judgment on how best to exercise those powers in furtherance of our mandate—a mandate to promote financial stability, maximize sustainable job creation and maintain price stability.\n\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress, there is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this firsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in a long history that stretches from the debauching of monetary probity in ancient Rome to the inflation disaster that is now modern Zimbabwe.\n\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it, he notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the Reichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, is reported to have \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[9]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. The Fed under Paul Volcker's leadership was certainly a \"nuisance,\" but you would be hard-pressed to find anyone alive today who would argue the fact that the Volcker Fed pulled the nation from the precipice of economic calamity. It is important that the Federal Reserve be left to do its job and no more.\n\nHaving drawn that line in the sand, let me conclude by venturing an opinion on the business of our lawmakers: It is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism, including disguised protectionism in the form of nontariff barriers, \"buy American\" provisions and restrictions on capital flows. What made the Great Depression \"great\" was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the aforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany's free trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\n\nI have been quoted as saying that protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics.[10] It provides a temporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death. Were I not a taciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives, newly elected chief executive and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying \"Have a nice day!\" and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another sourpuss. I am, as I said, paid to worry. But I am a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even greater \"stress test.\" To counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Crash of '29, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: \"You're right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.\"\nSecond: \"You're wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.\"\nThird: \"You're wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country.\"\nAnd fourth: \"You're right if you bet that (leaders) in business, labor, and government are sane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.\"\n\nThis became known as \"Old Doc Nadler's Remedy,\" and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of us preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\n\nI conclude where I started, with wild dreams. It may seem like the stuff of the wildest dreams to imagine our getting ourselves out from our current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in my soul that when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more, now."

        "content": "February 9, 2009 Houston, Texas\n\nThank you, Dan [Yergin]. It is a pleasure to be here at CERAWeek and especially to be here in Houston, the energy technology capitol of the world.\n\nA week ago tonight, I returned to Texas from Washington, following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), some public talks to warn against the dangers of protectionism and finally a weekend of events surrounding the annual Alfalfa dinner.\n\nThe Alfalfa Club is an institution peculiar to Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongues firmly in cheek, its members nominate a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win and nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of this distinguished group—which in addition to Stassen has included my fellow Texans Jim Baker, Lloyd Bentsen, Robert Strauss, Jack Valenti, and both George Bush '41 and George Bush '43—is Veni, Vidi, Defici—\"I came, I saw, I lost.\"\n\nThis year's dinner was the first for President Obama, who at the time had been in office only 11 days. Alfalfans introduced Vernon Jordan as the candidate to head their ticket and challenge the real president. Mr. Jordan appeared on stage in a stovepipe top hat. With a twinkle in his eye, he addressed President Obama and said, \"Mr. President, you may have noticed my hat. At the end of my announcement speech, I will pass it on to you. I must merely wear it. You must pull a rabbit out of it.\"\n\nCertainly concerning the economy, Jordan hit the nail on the head. The only description of recent economic developments I have heard that is as cogent came from a woman who, having just commiserated with her accountants, put it this way: \"This has been like the divorce from hell: My net worth has been cut in half and I'm still stuck with my husband.\" The mood and pace of the economy have shifted from near bliss to acrimony and an almost palpable sense of betrayal. Our self-confidence has gone wobbly. Many of our fellow citizens feel trapped in an unsustainable situation. The challenge facing the new president is daunting.\n\nOnly yesterday, it would have appeared to the naked eye that the economy was cruising along in the most tranquil of seas. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded our 25th consecutive quarter of economic growth. Unemployment hit a low of 4.4 percent in March of that year. And the stock market closed at an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, with the S&P 500 Index finishing the day at 1,565. To be sure, there were some signs of friction developing—most noticeably a heating up of headline inflation, which reached its peak at a 9.6 percent annualized rate in June of 2008. And there were fissures developing in the superstructure of the credit markets—most noticeably in the housing market, but also on the balance sheets and income statements of major creditors and various consumers. But to the unsuspecting world, all was well.\n\nIn 2008, conditions shifted radically. You all know the events that have transpired, and I will not belabor them. They are neatly encapsulated in the most recent data. Our gross domestic product is no longer growing, but shrank at an annualized pace of 3.8 percent in the final quarter of 2008. By my estimate, it is on pace to contract further throughout this year. Industrial production is falling sharply; consumption is cascading downhill; demand has evaporated as businesses and consumers alike pull in their horns and de-lever from excess indebtedness that fueled the prior boom. Unemployment has increased to 7.6 percent at the last reading and appears to me to be headed in the direction of, and possibly past, 9 percent.\n\nBankers and other creditors, having noted that the horse long ago bolted from the confines of prudence, are now shutting the proverbial barn doors. The credit intermediation process has become dysfunctional. Once ubiquitous, credit has become quite expensive—if you can get it. As for stocks, the S&P 500 Index closed today 44.4 percent off its October 2007 peak and has become historically and hysterically volatile.\n\nI will not venture to predict the behavioral future of our manic-depressive friend, Mr. Market. But I do know the consequences of his intemperate disposition. Faced with an unforgiving stock market and creditors that have become tighter than a new pair of shoes, businesses are doing what they can to stay profitable: As demand for their products shrinks, they are slashing every cost factor under their control to preserve their profit margins. They are addressing their cost of labor by cutting \"head count.\" They are delaying capital expenditures. They are demanding that suppliers cut their prices and are tightening inventory management. They are watching their receivables and stretching out their payables. And they are taking every step they can to clean up their balance sheets. (One of my colleagues recently quipped that when looking at the balance sheets of consumers or banks or many other companies these days, nothing on the left is left and nothing on the right is right.)\n\nThere are plenty of armchair quarterbacks who now claim to have seen all this coming. Indeed, we must acknowledge that many in the financial community, including those at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the telltale signs of financial system excess.\n\nPaul Volcker told me recently that in his day, he knew that a bank was headed for trouble when it grew too fast, moved into a fancy new building, placed the chairman of the board as the head of the art committee and hired McKinsey & Co. to do an incentive compensation study for the senior officers.\n\nPaul Volcker is the wisest of men (and I hope, parenthetically, that President Obama makes full use of his wisdom). Yet, I believe the following provides a more fulsome and insightful description of what we recently experienced. This is a long quote, so bear with me, as it perfectly captures the circumstances that led up to our current predicament:\n\n\"Every now and then the world is visited by one of these delusive seasons, when 'the credit system' ... expands to full luxuriance: everyone trusts everybody; a bad debt is a thing unheard of; the broad way to certain and sudden wealth lies plain and open; and men ... dash forth boldly from the facility of borrowing.\n\n\"Promissory notes, interchanged between scheming individuals, are liberally discounted at the banks.... Everyone talks in [huge amounts]; nothing is heard but gigantic operations in trade; great purchases and sales of real property, and immense sums [are] made at every transfer. All, to be sure, as yet exists in promise; but the believer in promises calculates the aggregate as solid capital....\n\n\"Speculative and dreaming ... men ... relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows. The example of one stimulates another; speculation rises on speculation; bubble rises on bubble....\n\n\"Speculation ... casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the [financier] a magician, and the [stock] exchange a region of enchantment.... No 'operation' is thought worthy of attention that does not double or treble the investment. No business is worth following that does not promise an immediate fortune....\n\n\"Could this delusion always last, life ... would indeed be a golden dream; but [the delusion] is as short as it is brilliant.\"[1]\n\nThat was not written by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times or Paul Gigot of the Wall Street Journal or David Brooks of the New York Times or Leon Hale in the Houston Chronicle. It was written by Washington Irving in his famous \"Crayon Papers\" about the Mississippi Bubble fiasco of 1719.\n\nIrving, mind you, had never heard of a subprime mortgage or a credit default swap or any of the other modern financial innovations that are proving so vexing to credit markets today. He had never heard of Bernie Madoff. But he understood booms propelled by greed and tomfoolery and what happens when what one old colleague called \"irrational exuberance\" is replaced by irrational fear—when what was a sure thing yields to uncertainty. Uncertainty is the ultimate enemy of decisionmaking, forcing an otherwise robust credit system into a defensive crouch. (A fellow being interviewed on television not long ago was asked what positions he would advise his clients to take to ride out the current storm. He replied \"cash and fetal.\")\n\nWith uncertainty in full fever, cash is hoarded, counterparties are viewed with suspicion and no business appears worthy of financing. The economy, starved of the lifeblood of capital, staggers and begins to weaken.\n\nSo what have we at the Federal Reserve done about it?\n\nWe could have let nature run its course. P. G. Wodehouse, my favorite comedic author, used to say that \"there is only one cure for gray hair. It was invented by a Frenchman. It is called the guillotine.\" Or we could have just ignored it and mandated that it simply not be discussed, as the Latvian government did recently by decreeing that the Security Police arrest any economists who question the security of its banks or the value of its currency (the lat).\n\nMy colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are red-blooded Americans. We refuse to be fatalistic. (Besides, those of us who have hair have seen it turn gray this past year.) Though in normal times, central bankers appear to be the most laconic genus of the human species, in times of distress, we believe in the monetary equivalent of the Powell Doctrine: We believe that good ideas, properly vetted and appropriately directed with an exit strategy in mind, can and should be brought to bear with overwhelming force to defeat threats to economic stability.\n\nLet me go back in history once more. The basic playbook for how a central bank, as the economy's lender of last resort, deals with a financial crisis was written in the early 19th century by two men named Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot.\n\nBagehot's prescription to counter a panic bears repeating: \"The holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities, but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others. They must lend to merchants, to minor bankers, to 'this man and that man' whenever the security is good.\"\n\nBagehot describes the response of the Bank of England to the Panic of 1825 by quoting its governor as follows: \"We lent it … by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before; we took in stock on security, we purchased Exchequer bills, we made advances on [those] bills, we not only discounted outright, but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount, in short, by every possible means consistent with the safety of the Bank....\"[2]\n\nAll the while bearing in mind the advice rendered by Thornton, writing in 1802: \"It is by no means intended to imply, that it would become the [Central] Bank to relieve every distress which the rashness of [bankers and financiers] may bring upon them.... The relief should neither be so ... liberal as to exempt those who misconduct their business ... nor so scanty and slow as deeply to involve the general interests. These interests, nevertheless, are sure to be pleaded by every distressed person whose affairs are large, however indifferent or even ruinous may be their state.\"[3]\n\nIf you are looking for a cognitive road map of what the Fed has been up to as we navigate between the need to \"advance most freely for the liabilities of others, lend to bankers and merchants, and 'to this man and that man' whenever the security is good\" and the equally compelling need to fend off the moral hazard of relieving \"those who misconduct their business,\" you might dust off your Bagehot and Thornton.\n\nOf course, the panics of the 18th and 19th centuries were different in size and shape than those of recent times. The nature of financial crises changes with time, reacting to the dynamic contours of the economy and financial evolution. Thus we must learn from experience, augmenting the theories and models that come from the study of past remedies.\n\nI recently read Ken Follett's magnificent book World Without End.[4] It is a massive tome that runs for 1,014 pages. (I was tempted to rename it Book Without End.) It deals with the Black Plague that crippled England and Europe in the 14th century. In those days, the monks were the intelligentsia, and those who practiced medicine were sent to Oxford to learn from the theorists of ancient Greece. The nuns were the nurses. In the middle ages, women were not allowed to attend Oxford, so they learned from doing.[5] While the monks adhered to the Oxford-taught, old orthodoxy of studying the \"humors,\" of bleeding, and of invoking the dictum of fiat voluntas tua (\"Thy will be done\"), the nuns adapted their techniques according to what actually worked. The punch line of World Without End is that the community where the story takes place is spared the worst effects of the Plague by a savvy nun named Mother Caris, who applies experience and adapts established methods and theories to address the needs of the time.\n\nWe at the Federal Reserve do not believe in the economic equivalent of \"fiat voluntas tua.\" We believe in using our powers proactively. We have dusted off our Thornton and Bagehot and then some. We have been neither \"scanty nor slow\" in addressing the pathology of our economy and financial system. We have \"lent by every possible means and in modes … consistent with the safety of the bank.\" And we have made abundantly clear that despite having reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to the \"zero bound\"—the old orthodoxy—we will not shy from pursuing all practicable means available to a central bank in supporting the functioning of financial markets and stimulating the economy back to a steady state.\n\nLike Mother Caris, we have learned from the experience of crises more recent than the ancient debacles of the Mississippi Bubble or the Panic of 1825. We have studied the mistakes made by other lenders of last resort who failed to properly deploy their forces in times of distress, such as the Federal Reserve in the 1930s and the Bank of Japan in the 1990s. And we have reviewed the actions taken by others more successful, such as those of the Swedish Riksbank in response to their banking crisis of the early 1990s. Thus, starting on Dec. 12, 2007, when the base interest rate—the fed funds rate—was 4.25 percent, we began expanding our balance sheet by providing access to credit for longer terms to eligible depository institutions to alleviate funding pressures in the system.\n\nIn rapid order, over the course of a year, we took at least eight major initiatives: (1) We established a lending facility for primary securities dealers, taking in new forms of collateral to secure those loans; (2) we initiated so-called swap lines with the central banks of 14 of our major trading partners, ranging from the European Central Bank to the Bank of Canada and the Banco de México to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to alleviate dollar funding problems in those markets; (3) we created facilities to backstop money market mutual funds; (4) working with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, we initiated new measures to strengthen the security of certain banks; (5) we undertook a major program to purchase commercial paper, a critical component of the financial system; (6) we began to pay interest on reserves of banks; (7) we announced a new facility to support the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by student loans, auto loans, credit card loans and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration; and (8) at the end of November, we announced we stood ready to purchase up to $100 billion of the direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks, as well as $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities backed by Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae.\n\nAnd, as you all know, in a series of steps, the FOMC reduced the fed funds rate to between zero and one-quarter of one percent, a process which I supported once it became clear that the inflationary tide was ebbing. Simultaneously, at the request of the 12 Federal Reserve banks, and again in a series of steps, the Board of Governors lowered the rate it charges banks to borrow from our \"discount window\" so as to lower their cost of credit.\n\nAll of this has meant expanding our balance sheet. As of today, the total footings of the Federal Reserve have expanded to $1.9 trillion—an almost twofold increase from when we started in 2008. It is clear that we stand ready to grow our balance sheet even more should conditions warrant. Our options include purchasing longer-term Treasuries, expanding our holdings of mortgage-backed paper and purchasing larger amounts and different forms of asset-backed paper.\n\nYou will note that the emphasis of our activities has been on expanding the asset side of our balance sheet—the left side, which registers the securities we hold, the loans we make, the value of our swap lines and the credit facilities we have created. We feel this is the correct side to emphasize. The right side of our balance sheet records our holdings of banks' balances, Federal Reserve Bank notes or cash (currently over $830 billion) and U.S. Treasury balances.\n\nWhen the Japanese economy went into the doldrums, the Bank of Japan emphasized the right side of its balance sheet by building up excess reserves and cash, only to find that accumulation did too little to rejuvenate the system.\n\nAs I said earlier, in times of crisis many feel that the best position to take is somewhere between cash and fetal. But it does the economy no good when creditors curl up in a ball and clutch their money. This only reinforces the widening of spreads between risk-free holdings and all-important private sector yields, further braking commercial activity whose lifeblood is access to affordable credit. We believe that emphasizing the asset side of the balance sheet will do more to improve the functioning of credit markets and restore the flow of finance to the private sector. In the parlance of central banking finance, I consider this a more qualitative approach to \"quantitative easing.\" It is bred of having learned from the experience of our Japanese counterparts, much as Mother Caris learned from watching others' unsuccessful attempts at curing the Black Plague in her community of Kingsbridge.\n\nI realize that by straying from our usual business of holding plain vanilla, short-term Treasuries as assets and by shifting policy away from simple titrations of the fed funds rate, we have raised a few eyebrows. One observer has posited that we have migrated from the patron saint of Milton Friedman to enshrining Rube Goldberg.\n\nI rather like Rube Goldberg. I recall fondly the complex devises his protagonist, the felicitously named Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, would deploy to perform different tasks. If you turn to Wikipedia, you will find one of my favorites: the self-operating napkin. As described therein, it was activated when a soup spoon (Exhibit A) is raised to the mouth, pulling on a string (B), thereby jerking ladle (C) which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E), who jumps after it, tilting perch (F), upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H), whose new extra weight pulls cord (I), which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K), which causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allows pendulum (N) with attached napkin (O) to swing back and forth, thereby wiping face.\n\nI assure you the Federal Reserve has not abandoned the wisdom of Milton Friedman or Walter Bagehot or any of the other established patron saints of central banking. But these are complex, trying times. Our economy faces a tough road. We are the nation's central bank and we are duty bound to apply every tool we can to clean up the mess that has soiled the face of our financial system and get back on the track of sustainable economic growth with price stability. The men and women of the Federal Reserve spend every waking hour doing their level best to perform their duty. Even if we have to deploy a little Rube Goldberg engineering to get the task done.\n\nTo be sure, we have to be very careful in deploying our arsenal. For example, we are well aware that the issuance of new Treasuries is expanding at an eye-popping pace: Net new issuance of Treasuries was $145 billion in fiscal year 2007, expanded to $788 billion in fiscal year 2008 and, according to this morning's Financial Times, will broach $2 trillion in fiscal year 2009.[6] This \"guesstimation\" is based on the pace of issuance in the first five months of this fiscal year and an $800 billion price tag for the expected fiscal stimulus package (but before a net cost is assigned to the bank proposals that will be forthcoming from the Treasury). The Federal Reserve must, of course, be very careful to avoid the perception that it is monetizing the explosion of fiscal deficits, as this would undermine confidence in our independence and raise serious doubts about our long-term commitment to price stability. This does not mean, however, that we should refrain from buying Treasuries in this time of crisis. Similarly, we must be very cautious about the dimensions of our program to intervene directly in the market for asset-backed securities, making sure that our actions are, literally, the least we must do and no more. Most important of all, we must continue to make clear that we will unwind our interventions in the market and shrink our balance sheet back to normal proportions once our task is accomplished, for this is, indeed, our unanimous and unflinching intention.\n\nI would suggest to you that some of our innovative, Rube Goldbergian contraptions have begun to work. For example, the London interbank offered rate, known by its acronym LIBOR, has come down handsomely. This is important as most variable-rate subprime and Alt-A mortgages that will be reset in the immediate future are based on LIBOR. Our purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage-backed securities initially reduced the interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages to 5.19 percent, a record low, according to Freddie Mac data that start in 1971—though the rate has floated back upward as the yield on longer term Treasuries has risen with the new issuance calendar. And our commercial paper and money market fund facilities have improved the tone of the all-important commercial paper market—not just the A1/P1 paper market, in which we have directly intervened, but also in the A2/P2 market. It has also not escaped my attention that the premium over Treasuries that investment-grade corporations pay to borrow in the open market has declined by 20 percent and by 26 percent for non-investment-grade borrowers.\n\nDespite these accomplishments, we have miles to go before we sleep.\n\nPlease bear in mind that the Federal Reserve is only one arrow in the quiver that can be deployed to restore the nation's economic vitality. The power to stimulate activity through taxing and spending the American people's money lies with the Congress of the United States. All eyes are on the stimulus package being hammered out in the Senate, and, then, in conference with the House of Representatives. This is no easy task. Our senators and congressmen and -women must find a way to give our economic engine an activating short-term jolt without encumbering or disincentivizing the entrepreneurial dynamic that has made for the long-term economic miracle that is America. Simultaneously, they must agree to the funding and structure of a revamped banking system. And, on top of all that, they must begin, now, to dig us out of the very deep hole they themselves have dug in incurring unfunded liabilities of retirement and health care obligations—programs that are already on the books but have not yet been paid for—that Pete Peterson's foundation calculates at $53 trillion and we at the Dallas Fed believe totals over $99 trillion.[7]\n\nWe are navigating uncharted, financially treacherous waters. Our fiscal authorities must carefully plot a course between the immediate needs for stimulus and the future needs of our children and grandchildren.\n\nI trust the Congress will get it right. And, I should add, I hope that they—and you—continue to bear in mind the limited powers of the Federal Reserve. I believe it vitally important that the Federal Reserve must be left alone to independently craft policies using those powers, based solely on our best judgment as to what is needed to achieve financial stability and conduct monetary policy aimed at maximizing sustainable job creation without upsetting price stability.\n\nAs a central banker, I am genetically programmed to be a worrier. In times of economic duress, there is always a temptation for political authorities to compromise the central bank. I saw this firsthand in the Carter administration with the ill-advised imposition of credit controls. This was but one instance in history.\n\nLiaquat Ahamed, a former World Bank official and CEO of the bond management firm of Fischer, Francis, Trees and Watts, has written an entertaining book, titled Lords of Finance. In it, he notes that the founder of the German Reichsbank was Otto von Bismarck. When the Reichsbank was formed in 1871, Ahamed reports, Bismarck's closest confidant, Gershon Bleichröder, is reported to have \"warned [Bismarck] that there would be occasions when political considerations would have to override purely economic judgments and at such times too independent a central bank would be a nuisance.\"[8]\n\nIt is no small wonder that the political considerations of the First World War and the impulse to override what might have been the purely economic judgments of Germany's central bank led to the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic and the utter destruction of the German economy. I beg to differ with Herr Bleichröder. It is more important than ever that we maintain the independence of our central bank, keeping it free from being overridden by political considerations. As the executive branch and the legislature seek to navigate our economy to safe harbor, we must minimize the impulse to let political exigencies hamper the work of the Federal Reserve. If, in the process of doing what is right and proper by confining its activity to its singular purpose, the Federal Reserve becomes a \"nuisance,\" so be it. It is important that we be left to do our job and no more.\n\nHaving ventured into fiscal matters, let me conclude with another comment on the stimulus package being debated within the legislative branch. Whatever our elected officials decide to do, it is imperative that they withstand demands for protectionism. What made the Great Depression \"great\" was the Smoot–Hawley Act, with which everyone in this audience is familiar. You may be less familiar with the Long Depression that began when a flowering of new lending institutions that issued mortgages for municipal and residential construction in the capitals of Vienna, Berlin and Paris turned a cropper and began the financial panic of 1873.\n\nIf you study that debacle, you will quickly determine that what transformed a severe global downturn into a depression that lasted 23 years was action taken by our buddy, the aforementioned Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck. In 1879, he decided to abandon Germany's free trade policy. His actions were followed in quick succession by France and then by Benjamin Harrison, who won the U.S. presidential election of 1888 by running on a protectionist platform.\n\nI have been quoted as saying that \"protectionism is the crack cocaine of economics. It provides a temporary high but is instantly addictive and leads to certain economic death.\"[9] Were I not a taciturn, cautious central banker, I might have chosen my words with less constraint. As global growth slows and economic conditions in the United States toughen, our elected representatives, newly elected commander-in-chief and his agents must resist with every fiber of their beings the temptation to compound our travails by embracing protectionism. For if they fail to do so, the economic situation we are now all working so hard to overcome will seem like a cakewalk.\n\nThank you for bearing with me. I think I have said enough, if not too much. In the time-honored tradition of central bankers, I would now be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have."
