        "content": "November 14, 2007 Sydney, Australia\n\nThere is a map in the library of our home in Texas charting the sea-lanes that my ancestors and those of my wife took to the United States. Nancy is a direct descendant on her father's side of John Knox; her brother is named Michael Collins; her mother's ancestors are listed in the Domesday Book. It comes as no surprise that her Scotch/Irish/English family sailed directly across the Atlantic to America.\n\nMy family sailed through different waters. My ancestors had a penchant for migrating first to the antipodes of the Southern Hemisphere. My mother's parents sailed from Norway to South Africa to whale and to mine in the late 1800s and never went home. My father's ancestors came here to Australia from a far different place on the English landscape than the one occupied by Nancy's.\n\nWe do not know when the Fishers came to Australia. Nor do we know if they came of their own free will. We do know that my father, Leslie, was born in Toowoomba in 1904, was abandoned by his mother and was poorly kept by his luckless father. In January of 1910, at the age of 6, he was picked up sleeping on the doorstep of a bakery while his father was off begging for food. Thus began an exotic \"walkabout\" that ended happily in America.\n\nIn 1999, when I was negotiating the first stages of the U.S.–Australia Bilateral Trade Agreement as an ambassador and trade representative of the U.S. government, Canberra gave me what could be gathered of my father's files. They include a letter from the director of the State Children's Department of Queensland to the officer in charge of the Toowoomba police, dated April 4, 1913. It reads as follows: \"Leslie Fisher (was placed) under State control as a neglected child to our care by the Police Magistrate … in January 1910. [His] father had no place of abode and was living from hand to mouth.\" It goes on to inquire of the police whether Leslie Fisher, my father, \"has a home of his own, or is he living with any person in the locality?\" My dad was then 9 years old.\n\nTo our knowledge, the director never got an answer back. My father had disappeared, first into an orphanage, then to a series of rather harsh foster homes, then to the streets, where he, too, survived from hand to mouth as a street urchin until 1921, when at age 17 he was taken in as an \"apprentice mechanic\" at the firm of Foster and Dutton.\n\nHe swept the floors and worked a lathe, earning barely enough for food and clothing. At night, he slept on the factory floor. Shortly before he died at the age of 90—he was a tough old buzzard who kept all his marbles until he drew his last breath—he told me about the afternoon he accompanied his employer to a meeting in a hotel in Brisbane. Mr. Dutton ordered tea and tipped the waiter more than he paid my father in a month. It was then and there, my father told me, that he decided he would make something of himself, but that first he had to escape his past.\n\nIn February of 1924, at age 20, he sailed for South Africa—we don't know if he somehow paid his passage or simply stowed away—where he found work as a bus driver in Jo'Berg and eventually found my mother. Once they had saved enough, they sailed for America and the golden shores of California in 1939.\n\nBut America would not immediately have him. The United States was willing to admit my mother but not my dad. And so they shuttled between Los Angeles and Tijuana, a few hundred miles south just over the border on the Mexican side. Dad did what he needed to make a living, selling cars in California and beating the bookies at the then-famous Tijuana Race Track—a skill he no doubt honed as a street gambler and \"two-up\" champion back in Queensland. The U.S. authorities admitted him and my mother to U.S. citizenship in 1947.\n\nThe story gets richer still. In 1948, on the eve of the Red Army's entry into Shanghai, my father was hired to sail to that city to \"collect\" a payment a Chinese company owed a firm called Spazier Chemical and Soap. My mother and two brothers went with him. After a bit of time and effort, he succeeded in collecting the money, and they sailed out on the S.S. President Wilson back to Los Angeles. It was one of the last ships to leave Shanghai before China's troops closed down all passage. They brought back more than what was due Spazier Chemical: They brought me. I was born eight months after the Wilson left China.\n\nIncidentally, 50 years later, when I was helping negotiate the U.S. side of the deal to bring China into the World Trade Organization, Madam Wu Yi, who oversaw China's team, told me I must have gotten my luck in life from being \"Made in China.\"\n\nSoon after I was born, we moved to Mexico City, where I received my primary school education, and from there began the serendipitous life that was more than generously summarized by Tony Richards in that kind introduction.\n\nAlthough he led a rough life here, my father taught us to be proud of our Aussie heritage. He said he was just an example of the tenacity of Australians. \"They are the best brawlers and fighters in the world,\" he would say. And, for puckish good measure, he would add, \"and they love beer and bikinis.\"\n\nI am the product of an Australian walkabout of epic proportion, a testimony to the fact that Australians are the hardiest of peoples. I understand you have heard from some of my Fed colleagues via satellite, but I am very proud, as a son of an archetypically hardy Australian, to be the first representative of the Federal Open Market Committee (the FOMC) of the U.S. Federal Reserve System to address the Australian Business Economists in person. Thank you, Robert [Henderson], for inviting me here.\n\nI have recited this long and bizarre history not just out of familial pride, but because I know some among you feel the U.S. is a bit closed-minded about globalization and tends to think myopically—either because we are so bloody large or by virtue of having been a pretty-much self-contained economic powerhouse for so long. I was \"assembled\" in China from English/Australian and Norwegian/South African parts, was \"programmed\" in Mexico and realized my \"value added\" in the United States. You can't get much more globalized than that!\n\nMany of the governors and fellow bank presidents I serve with on the FOMC may have less complicated backgrounds, but they also get the picture: The economy in which we set monetary policy is entirely different from that of our FOMC forbearers, placing new demands on our skill sets.\n\nI will focus my comments tonight on the current state of the U.S. economy. Having just invoked my colleagues, I should mention, as I always do, that my comments this evening are in no way the official position of the U.S. Federal Reserve or the FOMC. They are my views, and mine alone.\n\nRecent Developments in the U.S. Credit Markets\n\nYou are all well aware of the events that began to rattle the credit markets in August. Indeed, the media and analyst coverage of the market turbulence has been so extensive that you would have had to have gotten lost on the walking tour around Ayers Rock last July and just now found your way back to civilization to be unaware of subprime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and the write-downs taken by several leading financial institutions. The disruptions to the orderly functioning of the financial markets have been significant, and the Fed and other central banks around the world have acted to keep those markets functioning. Beyond the troubles in financial markets, we have had an otherwise healthy economy in the U.S., with, thus far, the only other significant signs of weakening coming from continual corrections in the housing market.\n\nThe Federal Reserve took action in mid-August, first lowering the discount rate by a half percentage point at a specially convened session of the FOMC, making clear we, like all learned central bankers, had read Walter Bagehot. Then, at our regular September meeting, we cut the federal funds rate by a half percentage point and the discount rate by the same amount. By the time we met again on October 30 and 31, the hardening of the arteries or the blocking of the aorta, or whatever cardiovascular analogy you choose to describe what was afflicting the circulatory system of the credit markets, was no longer as severe and life threatening as it was in August. Indeed, investors had begun moving toward marking financial assets and exposures to market—pricing them according to what they might actually be bought or sold for—rather than at values posited by hypothetical mathematical models.\n\nA startling statement appeared in the Financial Times on October 26: A particularly astute market operator commented that \"corporate treasurers are no longer investing in things they don't understand.\" Imagine that! Investors are coming home from la la land. To be sure, they are not out of the woods quite yet, and they have miles to go before they, and we as central bankers, sleep. But they have gone beyond suspended reality. You might say the credit markets have gone from the ridiculous to the subprime; the subprime and related derivatives market is the focus of angst, but the ridiculous practice of the suspension of reason in valuing all asset classes appears to be in remission, if not over.\n\nWe have a way to go before full recovery and must acknowledge that shocks and accidents might happen. Phrasing it politely, as an Aussie-Texan, I suspect some real \"cow patties\" remain in some prominent institutional punchbowls in the U.S. and abroad, and they will undoubtedly come to light before too long. I would submit, however, that we are on our way back to markets priced by reason rather than fantasy and that systemic risk has been lessened substantially.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve remains ready to act if needed—as we have hopefully made clear by our actions and statements—I believe it was appropriate for the FOMC to focus squarely on the economy at its October 30 and 31 meeting.\n\nThe Outlook for the U.S. Economy\n\nAt 11 o'clock tomorrow morning Dallas time, the U.S. economy will officially be entering its seventh year of expansion. Here is how I view our economic situation from my perch at the Dallas Fed. To begin, one has to take account of the corrections from a long period of excessive inflation of the U.S. housing stock. The sharp turnaround in mortgage availability will influence consumer spending by affecting both the amount of household wealth and the ability of homeowners to tap that wealth. Because mortgage availability has changed so much so quickly, the precise effect of this change is hard to gauge and is thus worrisome. Yet, it may also be subject to overstatement, given the Fed's response. The overstatement may also be partly due to the news media's penchant for \"instant analysis\"—my favorite oxymoron, akin to jumbo shrimp or nonalcoholic beer—which tends to focus on the downside. The flexibility and recuperative power of our extraordinarily adaptive economy creates a dynamic often overlooked by pessimistic pundits and even some thoughtful economists. My soundings find no appreciable, let alone debilitating, signs of spillover into the rest of the economy as yet. To be sure, the economy has been weakened, but it has not shown signs of succumbing to the full-blown virus infecting housing.\n\nGoing back to January, and even more so since the spring, banks in my district and elsewhere have reported tightening terms and standards on loans to businesses and households, and the overall mood of the country as reported by the press is sour. Yet, we haven't seen sharp increases in initial jobless claims, dangerously low Purchasing Managers Index readings or persistent declines in durable goods orders. The service sector—which people too often forget accounts for 83 percent of the U.S. economy versus 11 percent for manufacturing, 5 percent for construction and mining, and 2 percent for agriculture—remains strong and productive. Indeed, economic growth was robust enough in the first estimate of third quarter growth to ring in at 3.9 percent. In an economy the size of the U.S., that means we added over $150 billion in output from July through September—a lot of new economic activity. What we added to GDP in just one three-month period exceeds the total annual output of your neighbor New Zealand by 50 percent!\n\nHouseholds are still reasonably optimistic, although perhaps a bit more cautious, about their job prospects, and consumer spending continues to grow at a decent clip. There remain widespread reports of labor shortages all across the country. Texas, where over 247,000 net new jobs have been created year to date, representing between 15 and 20 percent of the jobs created in the entire U.S. this year.\n\nThe bottom line? A fat left tail where some risk of substandard growth is clearly on the growth probability curve, but the more likely outcome is for the U.S. economy to continue to expand at a sustainable pace.\n\nIn part, this is due to service sector strength, infrastructure and durable goods spending that is running better than expected, fiscal stimulus and strong export performance. U.S. overseas sales have been propelled by increasing demand and facilitated by a progressively weaker dollar. We meet tonight as the trade-weighted dollar skates along a post-Bretton Woods low—not an easy thing for a strong-dollar man to note.\n\nCertainly, some risk remains that downward momentum will emerge. Personally, I worry about the plight of big population states like Florida and California, where the housing correction is having its severest impact. I note the reports issued by express shippers and ground transportation firms that show deceleration in year-over-year trends in pre-holiday traffic across the nation. I realize that Wal-Mart and other large retailers have seen a slowing in same-store sales growth, that shopping mall traffic is down, and that the restaurant business—a not-insignificant part of the service sector that employs 14 million Americans—is showing signs of strain as customers migrate from casual dining to more affordable fast-food providers. And, if you parse the data for the third quarter, you will see a pretty stout guesstimate of inventory accumulation. These are prototypical signs of an economy in stress.\n\nYet, before each FOMC meeting, I consult 35 CEOs from a broad range of businesses, and with the exception of homebuilders, not a single one of them feels the economy is at risk of falling off the table. Big builders and engineering firms report a booming domestic infrastructure business, especially in the petrochemical sector from the Gulf Coast up through the lower Midwest. The tech folks continue to find demand brisk—as manifest in earnings reports of Microsoft, Apple and others.\n\nOne of the biggest providers of computer services to businesses reports that, with the exception of financial institutions, sales have begun to flow again after being laid low by the uncertainty of August. The airlines report recent volume has been \"less bad\" than it was in the third quarter. Shippers and railroads are concerned about consumer holiday demand and note slowing trans-Pacific shipments into the U.S. Yet, they report that the tech product side of what they move looks good, so the net impact, while nowhere near robust, is that conditions have not materially worsened. Outside of housing and payments due to some major law firms, we are not seeing a significant lagging of receivables. The mention of law firms may have caught your ear. They have grown quite important to the U.S. economy. Nearly one million people work in legal services in America, roughly the same number who work in manufacturing automobiles and auto parts.\n\nInflation\n\nAs they survey the economic landscape, many of my business interlocutors, however, worry about prices. As do my staff and I. We have been experiencing a mitigation of inflationary forces and expectations recently, whether measured by such headline numbers as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the index of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) or the so-called core indexes that exclude energy and food prices. And we have seen it in the trimmed mean measurement preferred by the Dallas Fed.\n\nYet, there appears to be some uncertainty about whether we will continue to see inflation slowing. Partly this stems from retailers who report cost increases on goods imported from China or from shippers who see continuous upward pressure on lease rates to move more expensive imports across the seas. We are also hearing it in other anecdotal reports, such as the rise, nationwide, of salaries paid to attorneys, architects and other highly skilled professionals.\n\nOur concern about inflation at the Dallas Fed stems from two more pervasive sources—food and energy, where we foresee a risk of a more pernicious pass-through effect than we saw in the recent price increases of underlying commodities.\n\nIn food markets, we have seen a dramatic divergence this past year between food prices and the core measures that indicate inflation in the 2 percent range. The CPI shows food up 5 percent through September. Green grocery prices are rising at a double-digit pace. The Producer Price Index for finished consumer foods, or wholesale food prices, is up 4.3 percent year to date. This pattern has historical precedent. A spread of the current magnitude between food price inflation and the core index occurred on several occasions between 1957 and 1980. But we have not seen it in a quarter century.\n\nAs Australians, you know better than anyone about the dramatic increase in milk prices, to say nothing of grains and other foodstuffs that go into feeding any creature that walks on two or four legs. This is hardly encouraging, given that these price increases are occurring against a ramping up of the caloric and protein intake of a few billion new eaters in China, India and elsewhere. All told, it injects a modicum of doubt about the wisdom of predicting further significant declines in inflationary pressures.\n\nEnergy price dynamics further cloud the picture. If you talk to any of the major and independent oil companies, they will tell you they have no problem in finding oil or refining it or delivering final products. They will note, however, two key impulses that are at work:\n\nFirst, they see no evident slowing in the growth of demand for energy in the U.S. The energy appetite in the BRICs—the big, fast-growing nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China—is voracious, and they are only part of the developing world. An enormous amount of chemical plant infrastructure and capacity is being constructed everywhere—from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Middle East to China and Singapore—to be nearer to either feedstocks or growing final demand. Any analysis of the income elasticity of oil demand in low-income but rapidly growing nations like China and India points to even faster rises in energy consumption, with concomitant price consequences.\n\nSecond, price pressures at the margin are compounded by noncommercial activity in the markets that trade oil. Noncommercial contracts—the busywork of the \"city refiners\" in the financial exchanges in London and other places—have been running at triple their traditional volume lately.\n\nPrices for gasoline and distillates—where the pass-through rubber hits the consumer price road—are starting to inch up in response. Our retail gasoline price models at the Dallas Fed envision pump prices above $3 a gallon for the foreseeable future if crude stays above $85. Price pressures for other distillates are also becoming increasingly probable. And last, high inventories continue for natural gas, but it is noteworthy that prices have reversed their summer slide downward to $5.50 per million BTU and are now quoted at $7.15 at the Henry Hub in Louisiana, the key metric point for the U.S.\n\nAll this gives me a sense of discomfort on the headline inflation front, and it is a reminder that the balance of risks is not skewed unilaterally toward slower growth. This is not to say I expect inflation to veer out of control. But rather, it means that we must remain far from smug on the inflation front and must conduct monetary policy bearing in mind that the battle against the nemesis of inflation is a perpetual effort.\n\nThis vigilance has always been second nature for the subgenus of the human species known as central bankers. Like the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Federal Reserve and the FOMC rely on an impressive array of instruments in determining monetary policy that contains inflation so as to enable sustainable economic growth. We are blessed with a rich complement of superb economists and a fulsome dashboard of databases. But in the end, no models or formulas substitute for judgment in making monetary policy.\n\nOur job has been made more complicated by globalization—the freer flow of goods, services, money, ideas and people across national borders. Its present incarnation owes a great deal to the revolution in information technology. Faster, cheaper and better communications are breaking down barriers to international business and knitting the world's economies closer together faster than Skippy could outsmart a pack of hungry dingoes.\n\nConsider how this affects employment, which under our dual mandate the Fed is duty-bound to maximize without upsetting price stability. Computers, the Internet and fiber optics have opened new horizons for virtual immigration, which allows companies to assign tasks to workers nearly anywhere in the world. We can now tap into the intelligence on the ground in Slovakia or Mumbai as easily as you do in Sydney or Melbourne. Communications technology gives us the tools to get around—at least partly—the restraints imposed by physical location. It allows businesswomen and men to better manage their cost of goods and services sold, as well as their cost of capital, and to sell to a larger market, in their never-ending search to expand profit margins. That is the good news. The not-so-good news is that demand-pull and cost-push pressures abroad are transmitted more readily and ubiquitously to us at home.\n\nFor central bankers, this creates a challenge. We have yet to develop the tool kit we need to understand a technology-driven, seamless, globalized economy well enough to craft monetary policy with the precision we would like. In our eclectic community, we have been debating how monetary policy is affected by globalization, technological and communication innovations, and the implications of the economic evolution into a services-driven, knowledge-based economy. How do we as policymakers, attempting to influence the course of our respective economies, navigate the economic seas when these new forces are acting like a magnet beside our traditional compass, rendering us unsure as to how far off course we may be veering? Globalization is, in my view, particularly vexing as we seek the true north of inflation control.\n\nIf we are guided by core inflation, we run certain risks. Core inflation refers to prices measured through statistical procedures that systematically strip out certain items from the basket of consumer prices—in the U.S., usually food and energy. By ignoring items whose price movements display significant short-run volatility, so the argument goes, statisticians and policymakers can get a better sense of underlying trends in consumer price inflation. The goal is to strip out the noise so that we can focus on the underlying signal.\n\nIn principle, the concept of core inflation is sound. Because underlying price trends change only gradually, we will get a better sense of where overall inflation will be tomorrow if we look at measures that help us assess current trends, rather than at the recent behavior of headline inflation that includes all items, including volatile ones that skew the results.\n\nIn addition, the prices of most things are \"sticky;\" that is, they don't change minute by minute or day by day depending on market conditions. Some models now in vogue suggest that central banks should focus their attention on stabilizing an index of the stickier prices in the economy. Food and energy prices are manifestly not sticky in our economy and, so the theory goes, should not be the focus of our attention.\n\nCentral banks have good reasons to subtract volatile swings in prices, but routinely excluding food and energy—and only food and energy—is not, in my opinion, the best we can do. For one thing, not all food and energy prices are excessively volatile. Menu prices at restaurants, for example, are sticky, making information about their underlying trends quite valuable. Yet, a Big Mac is excluded from the usual core measurements, even though consumers eat millions of them every day. At the same time, other prices can be extremely volatile. Prices of infants' clothing, for example, are at least as volatile as most food and energy items, but they are included in standard \"ex food and energy\" versions of the CPI and PCE.\n\nA more discriminating approach might be to exclude the items with the most extreme price changes in a given period, regardless of whether those items are food, energy or anything else. This is the rationale behind trimmed mean measures of core inflation that guide our thinking. At the Dallas Fed, our measure excludes, or trims out, the extreme highs and lows of price changes each month for the PCE. A trimmed mean measure is also used by the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\nThe concept behind core inflation measures—seeking to eliminate noise and focus on signal—by disregarding food and energy prices altogether may be a sound practice in a relatively closed world with a predictable sense of the number of consumers and consumer patterns. This is what we had for a couple of generations during the Cold War era, led by an ultra-dominant U.S. economy; eliminating food and energy to silence a significant source of noise made sense in this structure.\n\nHowever, a tectonic shift has occurred. Globalization, rapid acceleration of technological innovation and a series of key geopolitical events have created an open economy infinitely more complex and decidedly more unpredictable. The world economy now incorporates China, India and the former captives of Soviet and Southeast Asian communism, and their caloric and BTU intake patterns are converging toward ours as they grow richer. Three billion people have entered the world's market, and they are ready to work, ready to innovate and ready to shop. As a result, we are undergoing a sustained period of fundamental economic change that is forcing us to reexamine energy and food price movements through different lenses.\n\nWhen we pay more for food and energy, it may no longer represent mere noise but might be providing signals of longer-term, structural inflationary pressures.\n\nIn these circumstances, a trimmed mean approach has merit. A trimmed mean approach will still trim out volatile noisy numbers, which might include food or energy in any given measurement period. But it will retain, and thus allow us to focus on, the signals sent to help determine the true course of inflation.\n\nNow, before you rush out from dinner saying that Richard Fisher weighed in against Mr. [Peter] Costello on behalf of the Reserve Bank, let me point out that trimmed means—while better than the standard ex-food, ex-energy core measurements—are imperfect things. A few items that have important implications for our living standards—computers being the prime example—experience large, technology-driven price declines month in and month out and hence get trimmed out. The Dallas Fed tries to correct for this potential source of bias through our choice of trimming proportions, but we realize that correction is imperfect.\n\nAn additional drawback is that while the theoretical virtues of trimmed mean measures may appeal to central bank aficionados and econometricians, they may fail to resonate with the people we serve. Humans—real people like my father and others who appreciate brawls, beer and bikinis—experience inflation and develop inflationary expectations based on what they see and experience in the marketplace and read in the papers. To people who drive to work, air-condition their home and eat, ex-food, ex-energy measures or trimming this or that out of a price index is nonsense. Central bankers must be attentive to this sensitivity if they are to maintain the public's confidence.\n\nIn formulating and making my arguments at the FOMC table about the direction of inflation, I draw on all three measures—the headline, the core and the trimmed mean number—in making my recommendations on monetary policy. I also draw on an intrinsic admiration for the dynamism and constant inventiveness of a society that can transform the poor and the luckless, like my own family, into middle-class prosperity, time and time again. And presently, viewing the U.S. economy through the lens of globalization, I find that there is greater symmetry of risk between growth and inflation than is commonly surmised.\n\nI will stop here and, in time-honored central banking fashion, now do my best to avoid answering your questions.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "October 12, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, for kicking off what will be a productive and rewarding two-day discussion. On behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I want to offer each of you a hearty Texas welcome. We are grateful to all of you for coming to spend time with us, to share your insights and wisdom, and to honor our esteemed colleague John Taylor.\n\nChairman Bernanke gave a very nice background on John's work and the significance of his ideas. There is little I can add, except to say that among those characteristics that all of us value so much about John are his decency and likeability. He is a good man, as well as a great scholar and policy aficionado. John, I am especially grateful you are chairing the advisory board of the Dallas Fed's newly launched Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, if only selfishly because it provides me and my colleagues with a vehicle for continuing to learn from, and work with, you.\n\nJohn Taylor has divided his career between academia and government service, and both spheres owe him a debt of gratitude for having done so. It is, I think, appropriate that this conference honoring John be hosted by a Federal Reserve Bank, because John's interest in monetary policy has been longstanding and has pervaded the research questions he has addressed. Fundamentally, John has demonstrated that it is possible to do serious economic research that takes monetary policy's role in the economy seriously. His efforts in this direction did much to restore a community of interests between academic and Federal Reserve economists at a time when the theoretical foundations underlying traditional monetary policy analysis were crumbling.\n\nEveryone here is familiar with how, back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, John and a few others embraced the notion that households and firms are forward-looking in their decisionmaking and intelligent in forming their expectations, but rejected the view that wages and prices adjust instantaneously to their market-clearing levels. It is these nominal frictions that give policy short-run leverage to influence the real economy. This approach to macroeconomics has grown in popularity to the point that it has become dominant inside and outside the Federal Reserve System. It has also stimulated interest in the nuts and bolts of how labor and product markets work. We have several papers in this conference that dig deep into these questions, and I am looking forward to hearing what the authors have to say about the implications of their research.\n\nCombine rational expectations with forward-looking, maximizing households and firms, and suddenly the private sector's behavior depends on the entire expected future path of policy. John was a pioneer in thinking about monetary policy in this new, rich and complicated setting. This conference will explore some of the literature that John inspired. We will also convene a distinguished panel later today that will help us understand how the new ways of thinking that John pioneered have influenced actual policy here and abroad.\n\nBefore we begin the discussions, I want to thank those of you who came great distances to join us today. Otmar Issing, Frank Smets and Volker Wieland all came over from Europe to be with us. Danke schön meine herren. Guillermo Ortiz came up from la Ciudad de México. Muchas gracias muy amigo mío. Bienvenido. We have attendees from the Norges Bank, Banque de France, the Bank of Japan and the strong currency haven of the Bank of Canada, and, to prove that good people are willing to travel long distances to honor John, from the Reserve Banks of both Australia and New Zealand. Wherever you have come from, we appreciate your presence.\n\nI especially wish to thank the gentlemen who poured their blood, sweat and tears—and a bit of the Dallas Fed's treasure—into organizing this conference: Lawrence Christiano, Robert Leeson, Andrew Levin and our own Evan Koenig. They deserve a special pat on the back. And last, but certainly not least, John, thank you for agreeing to this conference. We are honored to have the privilege of honoring you.\n\nWe have an exciting couple of days ahead of us. Without further ado, let's get started with the paper by Robert Leeson, Francesco Asso and George Kahn.",

        "content": "October 4, 2007 Charlotte, N.C.\n\nThank you for such a warm introduction laced with good old Southern hospitality. It is a special pleasure to address the Charlotte Economics Club. Harvey Rosenblum, the Dallas Fed's director of research, spoke to this group about five years ago and still recalls the experience fondly. Like me, Harvey was hosted by Enrique Sanchez, who has been gracious and kind. Charlotte is clearly a vibrant city, the headquarters now of nine Fortune 500 companies and two of the nation's largest banks. Between Dallas and Charlotte, I would say we about have it wrapped up.\n\nThe Fed has been getting a fair amount of attention in the last few months—almost as much as O.J.'s sports memorabilia collection and the New York Mets' spectacular fall from grace. We central bankers are unaccustomed to being in the limelight—let's face it, we are an unexciting lot. Not many people are proud to admit being devotees of the \"dismal science.\" You know the story of the fellow who goes to his doctor in Dallas to get the report on his latest physical. The doctor looks at him and says, \"Look, pal. I am going to tell it to you straight. You are fatally ill. I suggest that you marry an economist and move to East Texas.\" \"Jeez,\" the crestfallen man says, \"this is awful. I am astonished. Let me see if I get your drift. Are you telling me that if I marry an economist and move to East Texas I will live longer?\" \"No,\" says the doctor. \"But it sure as heck will feel that way.\"\n\nWith all the hoopla over credit markets, British bank runs, commercial paper, moral hazard, the shriveling housing market and you-know-whose new memoir, I thought it would do us all some good to step away from the hot topics of the day. I'd like instead to reflect upon the less-than-scintillating topic of inflation and price measurement. It is not the stuff of headlines, but it is important. If you indulge me this privilege, I would be happy to take questions on any and all subjects during the Q&A period after my monologue and place my talent for obfuscation on full display.\n\nBefore I begin, let me state up front that whenever I speak, it is only to express my personal views. I am not speaking on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nMost of you are no doubt familiar with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), that broad inflation measure the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes, like clockwork, once a month. We usually refer to that number as \"headline inflation\" because of the press coverage it gets. The BLS' monthly report includes another inflation measure, called \"core inflation,\" which excludes food and energy. Once a month, the Bureau of Economic Analysis releases headline and core versions of another closely watched price index—the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) deflator.\n\nIt is the core measures that I want to focus on today and, specifically, why food and energy items have been deliberately and systematically ex-ed out when we look at price movements. It boils down to what engineers call a \"signal extraction\" problem; struggling to eliminate \"noise\" in our monthly inflation measures and trying to maximize the amount of \"signal.\" The question is: Is this still the best way to separate the wheat from the chaff?\n\nLet's start with a little history: The term core inflation was coined in the early 1980s, but the practice of stripping certain components from the basket of consumer prices began much earlier. Contrary to popular belief, it was food, not energy, that first got the \"ex\" axe. The BLS has produced an \"ex food\" version of the CPI since the late 1950s, probably because food prices in the 1950s were even more volatile than they are today. The practice of reporting a CPI excluding both food and energy prices began when energy price volatility dramatically increased in the 1970s.\n\nBy ignoring items whose price movements display significant short-run volatility, statisticians and policymakers can get a better sense of underlying trends in consumer price inflation. Because the trends change only gradually, measures that give us a better sense of what they are today provide a better sense of where overall inflation will be tomorrow. To make inflation forecasts over the next 12, 18 or 24 months, we are much better off looking at the recent behavior of a core measure—whether ex food and energy or a trimmed mean, which I will define in a moment—than we are looking at the recent behavior of headline inflation.\n\nThat is the statistical argument. A theoretical argument offers somewhat more subtle reasoning for using core measures. It goes something like this: Even in the age of the Internet, sellers of goods and services cannot change prices every day. They have menus, they have price tags and they have price-sensitive customers who live on budgets. Adjusting prices is a costly affair and not something that most sellers would do with every change in market conditions.\n\nMy local Starbucks, for example, does not slash prices on days or for hours when foot traffic is unusually slow, nor does it raise prices when the place is packed and the line is out the door. It does not change them in response to day-to-day movements in its cost of materials. In fact, it was just nine weeks ago that Starbucks adjusted its beverage prices systemwide, about 10 months after its last price adjustment. It is to this sort of pricing behavior that economists affix the elegant and intellectually snappy designation of \"sticky.\"\n\nWhen inflation picks up, firms that have delayed raising prices even as their costs have risen eventually do increase their prices. When the sticky prices become unstuck, the hike will be significant. Of course, not all sticky-price firms will raise their prices in lockstep with each other. The varied timing of the price increases creates a distortion in consumer spending. To correct for these factors, some economists suggest that central banks should focus on stabilizing an index of a basket of goods whose prices are especially sticky.\n\nFood and energy prices are manifestly not sticky in our economy and, so the theory goes, should not be the focus of our attention. To put it differently, theory suggests that a central bank should pay more attention to the occasional increases in the price of a Starbucks latte than to the daily price swings at the corner Exxon station.\n\nCentral banks have good reasons to subtract volatile swings in prices, but routinely excluding food and energy—and only food and energy—is not, in my opinion, the best we can do. For one thing, not all food and energy prices are excessively volatile. Menu prices at restaurants, for example, are sticky, making information about their underlying trends quite valuable. Our Starbucks coffees are excluded from the usual core measurements, even though American consumers drink many millions of them every day—including the one I had this morning. At the same time, other prices can be extremely volatile. Prices of infants' clothing, for example, are at least as volatile as most food and energy items, but they are included in standard \"ex food and energy\" versions of the CPI and PCE.\n\nA more discriminating approach would be to exclude the items with the most extreme price changes in a given period of time, regardless of whether those items are food, energy or anything else. This is the rationale behind trimmed mean measures of core inflation. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland produces such a measure for the CPI, and we at the Dallas Fed produce one for the PCE. These measures exclude, or trim out, the extreme highs and lows of price changes each month.\n\nMany of the arguments for excluding food and energy—in particular, the statistical arguments—are based on the notion that an exceptionally large price increase today will be offset, somewhere down the road, by an exceptionally large price decline. But suppose the increases in food and energy prices we've been seeing over the past few years represent longer-lived trends, rather than transitory blips. The arguments made for excluding food and energy prices would be on shaky ground. To put it more succinctly, we risk throwing out the signal along with the noise.\n\nCharlie Bean, the chief economist of the Bank of England who is on the Advisory Board of the Dallas Fed's Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, posed an interesting question after noting that globalization not only delivers freighters full of inexpensive electronics, toys and apparel to consumers in the U.S. and Europe but also puts upward pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities. What sense does it make, the real Mr. Bean asks, to exclude the food and energy price increases from our inflation gauges while incorporating the price declines on the other goods that we buy?\n\nCharlie was making a point in support of the Bank of England's policy of looking only at headline inflation and explicitly eschewing core measures in its official communications, projections and analyses. The European Central Bank does this as well. Our northern neighbors at the Bank of Canada describe their goals in terms of a headline measure but give an explicit role for a core measure—the CPI excluding the eight most volatile items—as an operational guide.\n\nI prefer to make this an argument in favor of trimmed means: As often as food and energy prices are excluded from the \"upper tail\" of our Dallas Fed measure, items like toys, electronics and apparel are excluded from the \"lower tail.\" The trimmed mean meets both requirements of a good inflation gauge. It filters the noise created by excessively volatile prices. At the same time, it hews to Dr. Bean's observation that inflationary impulses can come from any part of the economy, including food and energy.\n\nIn practice, monetary policymakers look at a wide range of inflation gauges. Most of the participants on the FOMC prefer the core PCE. In Dallas, we have an official preference for the Trimmed Mean PCE. We have been producing this measure for over two years now. It excludes the items that consumers buy in a given month that have experienced the largest price increases or decreases, regardless of whether they are food or energy or any other consumable good or service. The particular items that get excluded from the top and bottom of the distribution of price changes will vary from month to month, but the proportions excluded remain the same: about 25 percent off the top and about 19 percent off the bottom, when items are weighted by their shares in spending. We end up with an inflation measure that does a better job of separating the noise from the signal.\n\nIn August, the annualized Trimmed Mean PCE came in at 1.6 percent, the same as July. August saw large price decreases for energy items—gasoline in particular—along with large price increases in several food components. Outside of food and energy, some of the more significant noisy items excluded were large price declines in jewelry and watches and men's and boys' apparel and large increases in the cost of dental care and bank services. Other items trimmed out in August included guns and ammunition, which fell in price significantly, and funeral expenses, which increased in price. I'll let you decide for yourself if the two price swings were related, but I will tell you that we have had to trim both of those items before because their prices moved the same way.\n\nLet's compare that number—1.6 percent—to other inflation measures. The annualized headline PCE rate, which includes all prices, was –0.9 percent for August, with a sharp drop in energy prices contributing to the negative rate. Annualized core PCE, or PCE ex food and energy, came in at 1.1 percent.\n\nOver the past 12 months, the trimmed mean moved down slightly to 2.1 percent, while both core and headline PCE came in at 1.8 percent. If the monthly trimmed mean numbers continue their downward drift of the past few months, the 12-month trimmed mean inflation rate could fall below 2 percent as well.\n\nThe argument about core-versus-headline measures in monetary policy is distinct from a more common and commonsensical complaint about excluding food and energy prices from inflation gauges. You saw it articulated in the latest edition of Newsweek.[1] People, including economists living in married bliss in East Texas, do not stop eating or air-conditioning their homes when food and energy prices jump. Excluding them suggests a disregard for the impact on real people. I empathize and sympathize. Keep in mind, however, that the price indexes a central banker uses to frame, craft and evaluate monetary policy need not be the same as the ideal index used for measuring the cost of living. Indeed, there are macroeconomic models suggesting that if wages are stickier than prices, a central bank would do well to focus on an index of wages rather than prices. I just can't imagine central bankers lasting very long in their jobs if they continually announced to the public their desire to hold down wage growth.\n\nLet me turn now to the factors driving the recent behavior of food and energy prices—with a particular eye to the question of whether those factors are likely to be transitory or persistent.\n\nMany factors impact the process of getting food and energy products to consumers, many of which are beyond anyone's control. A growing season in one part of the country or the world that is unusually wet or dry, hot or cold—like the drought Australia is having, for example—can lead to variations in crop production, leaving too much or too little to go around and large price changes from season to season or year to year at the checkout counter. Large swings in prices will follow. Shutting down just one major refinery—or several, as occurred along the Gulf Coast two years ago—can lead to declines in gasoline supplies and sharp rises in pump prices.\n\nIn economist-speak, supply and demand for both food and energy are inelastic, so even small changes in supply or small changes in demand translate into large changes in prices.\n\nThat is what economists have in mind when designing inflation measures that exclude food and energy—a paradigm in which the shocks are primarily transitory and have large but fleeting impacts on prices. But is that what's going on now? We have just enjoyed a fine lunch, so let's start with food.\n\nOver the short run, the supply of food depends primarily on the weather, but the decisions of individual farmers and ranchers also play a role in pricing. Farmers decide how much of their fields to plant in corn versus soybeans, and chicken producers, hog farmers and ranchers determine the size of their flocks or herds based on forecasts of the prices expected to prevail at harvest or market time. We usually think of demand as relatively fixed in the short run, but it is not so stable that farmers and ranchers do not sometimes err in their predictions. When Mother Nature runs amok or demand forecasts prove mistaken, or both, we end up with either gluts or shortages that require large price movements to clear markets.\n\nEven over several years, weather can still play a role in prices—witness the persistent drought conditions in the Upper Midwest or, as previously mentioned, Australia. But over the long haul, the main drivers of food supply are technological advances and the agricultural sector investment that fosters mechanization, higher yielding crop varieties and the like. On the demand side, long-term trends are primarily driven by growth in population and wealth. Changes in preferences can result from recognition of the health benefits or detriments of certain types of food, but the largest driver is surely growth in per capita income. Richer societies consume more calories, and a greater share of those calories is accounted for by animal proteins.\n\nIn the Industrial Age and the present post-Industrial Knowledge Age, agricultural innovation and investment have enabled the supply of food to grow at a faster pace than demand, confounding the gloomy forecasts of Parson Malthus. Look back in time and you'll see food becoming less and less expensive relative to other goods and services, even as the number of mouths to feed around the globe has increased and consumption per capita has grown. The price of corn, for example, may have increased noticeably over the past year, but it remains a bargain from a historical perspective: In 1860, the price of a bushel of corn was about 50 cents; translated into today's dollars, that is about $12 a bushel. The current price is a bit over $3.\n\nIt is true that the long decline in relative food prices has been punctuated by occasional reversals as the pace of technological advance has fluctuated or as demographics have changed. I remain optimistic about the very long-run trend of declining food prices, but I do recognize that we may be in the midst of one of those reversals as the world economy adjusts to recent changes in demand. Biofuels production may be playing a part in today's rising agricultural prices, but I believe this is minor in comparison to the evolving eating habits of billions of Chinese and Indians, the Vietnamese and former captives of the Soviet Union, Brazilians and Mexicans and others who are becoming increasingly wealthy. This reversal may take several years to play out before technology and investment can respond with sufficient supplies to put food prices back on their long-run course. In the meantime, we are subject to \"agri-flation\" that may be more sustained than we would like.\n\nOn the energy front, prices are shaped by demand and supply, just like most everything else we buy and sell. Demand is determined by improvements in energy-use technology and the world economy's growth rate, including the breakneck pace set of late by the so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Because energy consumption is not very responsive to prices in the short run and little excess capacity currently exists in the world's energy-supply chains, small changes in the real or perceived balance between supply and demand can result in very sharp price swings.\n\nLong-term energy supply is determined by the development of fuel resources—both conventional and alternative. Short-run production disruptions, actual or potential, can greatly affect energy prices. Geopolitical events buffet energy markets every day, whether it is civil unrest in Nigeria, nationalization in Venezuela, fighting in the Middle East, disputes between the West and Iran, or a strong-arming government in Moscow. Perceived changes in supply, including real or anticipated changes to OPEC production levels, can also add volatility to energy prices.\n\nOil prices have been on a steady climb in recent years, tripling since early 2003 and breaching $80 per barrel last month. This worries many people who remember the energy crises of the 1970s and the ensuing recessions. In fact, nine of the 10 post–World War II recessions were preceded by sharply rising oil prices. I will remind you, however, we have had several episodes of sharply rising oil prices in the past 15 years without recessions.\n\nRather than ignoring energy prices because they are dropped from core inflation, I am constantly picking apart energy prices to understand the cause of their recent climb. Here is what I see:\n\nFirst, it is useful to understand whether the run-up in prices is driven by increased demand or reduced supply. If it is reduced supply, like most of the oil price shocks prior to the mid-1990s, slowing economic activity and higher overall prices are likely. If the oil price increase is the result of a demand shock arising from productivity gains, however, we could see expanding economic activity and reduced inflationary pressures.\n\nRecently, the U.S. economy has responded to rising oil prices in a way inconsistent with a classic energy supply shock. Despite rising oil prices over the past four years, gross domestic product continued to grow, unemployment continued to fall and overall price pressures remained relatively moderate. Consumer spending and consumer confidence have remained strong compared with the 1970s or early 1980s. Business investment activity has also stayed on an expansionary course.\n\nEconomic growth in other countries has not been derailed, which has kept demand for our exports at healthy levels. A weakening dollar has not hurt other countries' demand for our products, or their appetite for oil, which is priced in dollars. And inflation has been kept at bay in most countries around the world, thanks in no small part to well-managed monetary policy here and overseas.\n\nAll of these positive signs are not what history teaches us to expect in a rising oil price environment. What gives? Economic research points to a number of factors—including a lower energy-to-GDP ratio, more flexible labor markets, more experience with oil price shocks, better monetary policy and less-rigid regulatory hurdles on energy-producing firms and such energy-using industries as airlines and trucking. In addition, the development and maturity of futures markets and derivatives have reduced the need for physical inventories, while securities markets have provided sources of investment capital.\n\nThese factors all seem quite reasonable, but I believe there is more to this story, and I am convinced that the economic resilience we have seen lately is the result of an entirely different phenomenon.\n\nFor a few years now, some economists have suggested that the U.S. economy ought to respond differently to rising oil prices if the increase is the result of stronger demand for oil needed to fuel an expanding U.S. economy rather than a result of diminished supplies. Indeed, several Dallas Fed economists are carefully studying this issue from a global perspective as I speak.\n\nSo far, they have shown that higher oil prices caused by productivity gains have a much different effect on the economy than oil supply shocks. A productivity shock originating in the U.S. will boost our economic output, and the expansion will pull up the price of oil. If monetary policy holds the growth of nominal GDP constant, this will result in a reduction of inflationary pressures. If China or India or some other country is expanding rapidly and it is the country's oil consumption that is increasing, driving up prices, that surge in productivity can yield spillovers for the U.S. in the form of lower import prices and technological gains. As long as this continues, we can expect to see an expansion of output and lower overall prices, even as the world price of oil rises. A vicious cycle is, in a sense, almost transformed into a virtuous cycle.\n\nWith each uptick in energy prices, I ask whether it is supply or demand that is making prices rise. Supply disruptions are cause for concern, but growth in demand is not as worrisome. Most likely, energy prices will continue to be volatile; it is the nature of the beast. The same goes for food prices.\n\nThose of us responsible for crafting U.S. monetary policy cannot afford to be distracted by the flux of short-term price changes that are destined to be unwound. Our eye should be focused on underlying inflationary pressures, some of which may indeed be coming from food and energy markets. Routinely excluding food and oil price movements from our inflation gauges may have made sense in the 1970s, the 1980s and even the 1990s—but not now, nor in the next few years. The conceptual beauty of trimmed mean inflation measures lies in their ability to capture steady increases in food and energy prices, which may be germane to the pursuit of price stability, while excluding the temporary spikes and dips that do not presage changes in the underlying inflation rate.\n\nSpeaking of beauty, conceptual or otherwise, I need to wrap up and get home to my wife in East Texas. By the way, she is not an economist.\n\nMay you all lead long lives.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "October 2, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Daniel [Frishberg]. The Greater Dallas Chamber was kind enough to invite me here today, and I thank them, too. I am going to take advantage of this opportunity to discuss how technology drives progress in the Knowledge Age. Technology is critically important to the Federal Reserve System. It helps us run the business of the central bank. And yet at the same time, it complicates the business of making monetary policy for the United States.\n\nI wear three hats in the Federal Reserve. I am president and CEO of one of the 12 Banks that operate the Fed's payments system business. I chair the Fed's Information Technology Oversight Committee. And I sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, which is responsible for crafting a monetary policy designed to foster sustainable noninflationary economic growth. Its actions are what the press and financial analysts love to bill and coo about.\n\nWhen I'm wearing my monetary policy hat, I consider IT from one perspective; in my two other roles, I ponder IT from another angle. Let me explain.\n\nFrom the business end, I look at IT as an enabler: It facilitates managing the Federal Reserve System and the business of our Banks. Consider these aspects of our operations:\n\nTake a dollar bill out of your pocket. Printed in bold letters along the top of it are the words \"Federal Reserve Note.\" We do not actually print money—the Treasury does that—but we are responsible for ensuring that the banking system and the economy have the currency they need to function properly. Each year, the Federal Reserve System processes approximately 37 billion of these notes—bills with denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. We store them in massive vaults at the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks and use 132 machines to count and sort currency at a rate of 90,000 bills an hour, day in, day out.\n\nWe also process the checks you write. Last year, we processed 9.1 billion paper checks and 1.5 billion electronically imaged checks.\n\nAnd we moved $5 trillion per day between financial institutions to settle their accounts.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System, in short, runs one of the largest financial businesses in the nation, and most of our work is accomplished by moving zeroes and ones through electronic spectra. Most people think we are analytical wonks, collecting, categorizing and correlating massive amounts of data for economic reporting and analysis—all of it needed to conduct monetary policy. But we also run a large, sophisticated materials handling business, involving shipping and receiving, sorting and inventorying. We use advanced scanning and other technological means to ensure currency is genuine and fit for recirculation. We use technology to digitize check images, transmit and store the images, and turn millions of images back into paper for presentation to the paying banks.\n\nOur mainframe processing power totals nearly 9,000 MIPS, or millions of instructions per second, if we have any nongeeks in the audience. Across the system, we have about 4,500 servers and 24,000 desktop computers in use. Our national networks support nearly 3,000 high-bandwidth circuits that reach about 1,500 end points, both internal locations and external customers. To keep this technology functioning, we employ some 3,000 IT professionals.\n\nBy itself, the Dallas Fed—located a few blocks from here on Pearl Street—moved 6.5 billion banknotes through our five-story-deep, robotically controlled vault last year. We are assuming responsibility for processing every paper check written in the western United States, from here to California. And as agent for the Treasury, we just processed our 1 millionth conversion of government-benefit payments from old-fashioned paper checks to direct deposit.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is a bank. We have $40 billion in assets. We make money off of those assets and the fees we charge from lending money and performing services, and we use the proceeds to pay down the federal deficit. Last year, after paying taxes and a healthy 6 percent dividend to our shareholders—the member banks in our district—we paid $1.3 billion into the U.S. Treasury.\n\nAs you can see, the Federal Reserve is a large, sophisticated business. Like any modern company, technology is at the core of our operations. And our cost structure: We spend a third of our budget on IT. It is money well spent. IT enables us to provide our services efficiently and effectively. It facilitates our management of the payments system for the American people. We are as eager as anybody else to exploit technology to reduce our costs and maximize our business returns. As business operators, we are saddled to Moore's curve as much as anybody in this room.\n\nNow, let me remove the hats I wear as a business operator and consider IT from the perspective of making monetary policy in the Knowledge Age.\n\nWhen the 12 regional Bank presidents and the seven Fed governors sit down to determine monetary policy as the Federal Open Market Committee, the great technological advances of our age significantly impact what we do. Why? Because innovations that create new markets, boost productivity or cut costs play a significant role in stimulating economic growth. And they help keep a lid on inflation. In a very palpable sense, advancements in technology aid the Fed in accomplishing its mission of underwriting sustainable noninflationary growth in the world's most powerful economy.\n\nThat is the good news.\n\nTechnological innovation, however, makes the work of central banking more difficult. Innovation foments economic change—think of electricity in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the microchip and Internet in our times. Successive waves of technology destroy old markets and create new ones. They alter cost structures and upset established relationships between inputs and outputs. They change the way economies operate, making the past a less reliable guide to the future. In effect, technological innovation constantly challenges our economic models, relentlessly trashing our operating manuals, much like Internet music downloads are pushing compact discs into the dust bin that contains our cassettes and eight-track tapes and supposedly \"long-playing\" record albums.\n\nThe 1990s illustrate how technology can shake central banking's basic tenets. Advances in information technology achieved a critical mass early in the decade, setting off an unprecedented surge in productivity. The economy began growing rapidly, pushing unemployment down below 4 percent. At the time, the Fed's econometric models flashed warnings about inflationary fires yet to come. The textbook response would have been higher interest rates, aimed at forestalling inflation. Instead, the Fed resisted the conventional wisdom, recognizing the world had changed and the U.S. economy's speed limit had increased. Technology would allow faster growth without kindling inflation.\n\nIt is the very nature of technology to undermine the status quo. This is hardly an original observation. In the period between the two World Wars, the iconic economist Joseph Schumpeter documented the effect of technological change on economic activity. Schumpeter was a man who knew how to pack a lot of meaning into a few words. He used to tell his students at Harvard in the 1940s that he aspired to be the world's greatest economist, the world's greatest horseman and the world's greatest lover. \"Two out of three isn't bad,\" he said in wistful summary of his accomplishments. He did not do well with horses.[1]\n\nIn the realm of economic thought, Schumpeter is best remembered for coining the phrase \"creative destruction,\" a seemingly paradoxical construct that with succinct and sublime precision describes how new ways of doing things continually replace the status quo, destroying jobs, companies and even industries that were rendered antiquated by the newly created technologies and replacing them with new ones.\n\nLet me give you a sample of the power of Schumpeter's insight. \"The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion,\" he wrote, \"comes from the new consumers' goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.\" He went on to characterize innovation as a force that \"incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\"\n\nCapitalism, in other words, is a continuous process of change—out with the old and in with the new. What drives the process? The profit motive. And competition. Schumpeter understood that the most powerful kind of competition was not between rival carriage makers, each offering a better price. No, it is the competition from whole new forms of transportation technology that bring the consumer a whole new way of traveling that eclipses the old.\n\nSchumpeter put it this way: \"A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any â??ways of doing things' which have been optimal before remain so afterward.\"\n\nWith each new generation of technology that you and your companies bring to market, those of us who study and model the economy have to rejigger our assumptions because \"hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.\"\n\nThe history of economic progress has always been shaped by new technologies—by the inventions of platforms that spur economic growth and spread prosperity around the world. The internal combustion engine made horse-drawn transport obsolete, but the new technology also moved people and goods faster and cheaper, saving time and money. The mushrooming numbers of cars, trucks and buses meant jobs for drivers, oilfield workers, road crews, mechanics and millions of others. ATMs culled the ranks of bank tellers, just as robotics replaced human hands on assembly lines and even in medical operating rooms. Eventually, the tellers and factory workers who lost their jobs were shifted to other sectors and contributed to the production of new goods and services that fulfilled human needs and wants.\n\nThis process keeps us on our toes. If you look at back at America's 100 most valuable companies in 1900, you'll see that all but a handful are no longer in business. The reason: new technology and the relentless economic change it unleashes. Take Baldwin Locomotive Works. It built some of the best railroad engines in the country—first steam, then diesel—making it one of the top U.S. companies for decades. But Baldwin Locomotive ceased operations in 1956. Times had changed. Technology had advanced. Baldwin was passed by.\n\nLook at today's most celebrated companies. Along with such perennials as Exxon-Mobil and GE, you'll see thriving enterprises built on technologies that didn't exist when many of you were born—Google, Cisco, Amazon, eBay and Research in Motion. Of course, if they do not stay on their toes, they, too, will eventually follow Baldwin Locomotive into oblivion.\n\nToday, we central bankers are grappling with globalization—the freer flow of goods, services, money, ideas and people across national borders. Its present incarnation owes a great deal to the revolution in information technology. Faster, cheaper and better communications are breaking down barriers to international business and knitting the world's economies closer together faster than the New York Mets can blow a pennant race.\n\nGlobalization proceeds at a pace dictated by technology. The world's economies are rapidly integrating today because communications technologies have made it cheaper and easier to deliver information at great distances and extend supply chains to the far corners of the planet. The Internet and e-mail and cell phones and satellite TV facilitate the exchange of the most valuable resource mankind has ever discovered: knowledge.\n\nConsider how this affects employment, which the Fed is duty-bound to maximize without upsetting price stability. New technologies have opened new horizons for virtual immigration, which allows companies to assign tasks to workers nearly anywhere in the world. We can now tap into the intelligence that is on the ground in Delhi or Dubai as easily as we do that which is in Detroit or Dallas. Communications technology gives us the tools to get around—at least partly—the restraints imposed on physical immigration. Throughout its history, the U.S. economy has benefited greatly from the brain gain, and we cannot continue as the world's technological leader without continuing to import foreign know-how. We hear a lot of talk about offshoring and the harm it purportedly does, but we American business operators have come to recognize how an interconnected world can be our lifeblood, nourishing our economy with a transfusion of knowledge transmitted through the ether of the Internet.\n\nSchumpeter wrote of the power of creative destruction in the context of the industrial era. Those essential lessons also apply, in spades, in our globalizing, knowledge-driven economy, when technological change has become a juggernaut and products' life spans have shrunk. New ideas, new products and new companies are arriving on the scene faster than ever, while new competitors are appearing on the horizon, continually upsetting the status quo. Moore's Law—which embodies the idea that change is recurrent and accelerating—is the fundamental reality of today's world.\n\nThe keynote essay of the Dallas Fed's 2006 Annual Report [2] points out 10 ways globalizing the Knowledge Economy has been raising productivity's level or its growth rate—or both.\n\nPoint No. 1, lower communications and transport costs make products cheaper for consumers and facilitate globalization.\n\nPoint No. 2, when economies become more integrated, competition is enhanced.\n\nAnd, Point No. 3, specialization is enabled.\n\nPoint No. 4, globalization gives companies new ways to ramp up their production functions. They can now access cheaper labor, raw materials and other resources at any time and from anywhere on the globe.\n\nPoints No. 5 and 6, globalization gives producers larger markets, increasing the potential payoff for innovation, business formation and risk taking. Large global markets allow companies to extend their economies of scale by producing to satisfy global, not just domestic, demand. This is particularly powerful in the Knowledge Age, where such things as microchips, pharmaceuticals and entertainment face high initial development costs but low marginal costs to produce.\n\nIn the New York Times the other day, a senior vice president at India's Infosys Technologies succinctly summarized Points 4, 5 and 6 by referring to the future of outsourcing as the ability to \"â?¦take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world.\"[3] He might easily have added, \"and then sell it in any part of the world.\"\n\nPoint No. 7, capital markets expand in a globalized world, freeing money to seek the highest return available and fund development of new production capacity anywhere on the planet.\n\nPoint No. 8, it is easier for productive knowledge to spread across borders, fueled by migration, the Internet, cell phones and trade.\n\nPoint No. 9, globalization erodes national or natural monopoly power, reducing the excess burdens imposed on consumers.\n\nAnd finally, Point No. 10, globalization increases the range—and potential rewards—of goods that can be consumed by more than one person at a time. Just because I'm downloading the most recent episode of The Office from iTunes does not mean someone in Singapore cannot download it at the same time. Which is something you cannot do with the same can of peas or the same steel beam. We have had decades to contemplate the globalization of goods markets—TVs, shoes, clothing, furniture and more, much of it produced by low-wage labor in faraway lands. But the point of the essay in our annual report—copies of which we will have for you as you leave the room—is that today's globalization means international competition has spread beyond manufactured goods. Modern communications technology has brought the reality of globalization to broad realms of the economy that until recent decades had been largely isolated from it. The nexus of technology and globalization brings business opportunities for those of you with vision and entrepreneurial instincts. For central bankers, it creates a challenge. We have yet to develop the tool kit we need to understand a technology-driven, globalized economy well enough to craft monetary policy with the precision we would like.\n\nWe are not alone in feeling somewhat uneasy with the changes swirling about us. A large segment of the public feels threatened by the technology that we in this room embrace, and they fear the globalization it fosters. There is nothing new in this. When he was governor of New York, Martin Van Buren supposedly wrote a missive to President-elect Andrew Jackson in which he said, \"If canal boats are supplanted by â??railroads,' serious unemployment will result. Captains, cooks, drivers, hostlers, repairmen and lock tenders will be left without means of livelihood, not to mention the numerous farmers now employed in growing hay for horses. Boat builders would suffer and tow-line, whip and harness makers would be left destitute. â?¦ As you may well know, Mr. President, â??railroad' carriages are pulled at the enormous speed of 15 miles per hour â?¦ by â??engines' which roar and snort their way throughout the countryside, setting fire to the crops, scaring the livestock, and frightening women and children. The Almighty certainly never intended that people should travel at such breakneck speeds.\"\n\nNow, the Almighty has given us the means to move at the speed of light through cyberspace. Today, technology is again doing what it has always done—creating enormous angst among those it displaces. And yet it is raising living standards and increasing economic efficiency in most parts of the world.\n\nWe live in a time when it is fashionable to look at all glasses as half full. Chicken Little rules the roost of economic prognostication. The innovators in this room know differently. Heirs to Eli Whitney, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and the Wright brothers, American entrepreneurs are accustomed to operating in an economy that is the crucible of innovation. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg and, of course, Bill Gates sprang from the American landscape, not from Germany or France or China or India or anyplace else. Inventiveness is part of the American DNA, nurtured in an economic system that encourages innovation and rewards it handsomely. New products and new technologies find fertile soil here in Texas and throughout the United States, where they can be funded and brought to market, only to be challenged in due course by the next round of new products and new technologies.\n\nA free enterprise system recognizes that innovation cannot be predicted or controlled. No part of the computer was invented with the computer in mind. The keyboard came from the typewriter, invented in the 1860s by Christopher Latham Sholes. The first program was written for Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom in 1801, a technology to avoid mistakes made by the weavers. Vacuum tubes and transistors were first associated with radio and then television. The microchip was invented for handheld calculators, not for computers per se. And the electricity that powers it all started out as a better way to light up dark rooms. Mix them all together and—voila—you have a computer, the unintended consequence of a series of separate inventions.\n\nWhat put the computer together was the profit motive—the potential to get rich by exploiting all the connections, all the angles, all the possible products consumers might buy. This is why America is by far the most inventive nation in the world. We are not necessarily smarter, though I would like to think we are. We do not have some intrinsic aptitude that others lack, though I would like to think we are pretty darned clever. We are not always luckier, though we are very lucky people. What we do have that sets us apart is an economic system that provides rewards for those who dare to turn their ideas into realities. We have what you might call incentive aptitude. You give us an incentive, and we'll find an aptitude!\n\nAmerican technology will continue to march forward, as it has for generations. Skeptics have always been proved wrong. Charles Duell once ran the U.S. Patent Office. He would probably be forgotten by now if not for a few words he is purported to have uttered in 1899—after the introduction of telephones, electric lights and automobiles â?¦ but before the next wave of innovation that brought us airplanes, refrigeration, radios and my favorite great invention, the pop-up toaster. In 1899, amid the great burst of innovation, one that rivaled what we see today, Duell infamously proclaimed: \"Everything that can be invented has been invented.\" If Duell had been right, the job of econometricians and monetary policymakers would have been made so much easier. They could have put everything on autopilot. And, as a nation, we would have gone into decline, deprived of the fresh energy of new technology. I'll return to my best buddy—Schumpeter. He knew better. He wrote that \"we cannot reason â?¦ about the future possibilities of technological advance â?¦ those [technologies] that are still in the lap of the gods may be more or less productive than any that have thus far come within our range of observation. ... There is no reason to expect slackening of the rate of output through exhaustion of technological possibilities.\"\n\nWe know not what marvels still sit in the \"lap of the gods.\" But history tells us it is a fool's game to expect a slackening of the rate of technological accomplishment. Some of you may even play starring roles developing the future waves of technology. Your efforts and the fruits of your labor will fuel the incessant revolution of our economic system, making the work of central bankers more confusing and challenging. As sure as I am standing here, I know that your success will make my job harder. I ask only one thing of you:\n\nKeep it up.",

        "content": "September 24, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nI am delighted you have invited me back to this symposium, particularly in light of my rather pointy-headed presentation last year on the nitty-gritty of how central bankers measure inflation. I want to avoid any possibility of injuries in a stampede for the exits, so I promise not to inflict a lot of mind-numbing economist jargon on you today. I am going to speak this morning on the importance of having first-class institutions of higher learning in Dallas and in Texas.\n\nI am guessing, however, that you, being in the real estate business, probably know that last Tuesday the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting and decided to cut the federal funds rate by one-half of 1 percent, an event that seems to have given rise to almost—but not quite—as much chatter as recent developments affecting the sports memorabilia collection of O.J. Simpson. I also suspect you are eager to hear about the current state of the housing and money markets and the health of the economy. I will indulge your interest briefly and then get on to a message about education that I would like you to listen to very carefully.\n \nWhat I say today, as always, represents my personal views and mine alone. I make no pretense—and never do—of speaking for my colleagues on the FOMC or of representing the views of any other senior Federal Reserve official.\n \nTo put last week’s FOMC decision in a broader context, it is important to understand that the Fed operates under a dual mandate. That dual mandate can be summarized in one sentence: We are charged by Congress with conducting monetary policy in a way that enables sustainable, noninflationary growth of the American economy and its employment base. It goes without saying that we must use our franchise to ensure a smoothly operating financial system. Money is the blood of the body of capitalism. It must be pure and free of the virus of inflation, and the cardiovascular system through which this lifeblood of the economy flows must be in good working order.\n \nAs we sat down to the FOMC table on Tuesday, we were faced with a situation that, drawing on my Naval Academy days, I would liken to a ship navigating a narrow passage between two shorelines.\n\nOn one shore, we have an otherwise healthy economy weakened to an unknown degree by a correction to excessive speculation in its housing sector and related financial instruments. On the price front, the economy has been experiencing mitigation in inflationary tendencies, thanks, I believe, to prudent monetary policy—albeit against a background of an energetic global economy that continues to create upward price pressures on all sorts of commodities, on transportation costs and even on what was once assumed to be an endless supply of cheap imports from China.\n\nIf we had maintained the anti-inflationary course we had been following for more than 14 months by holding the fed funds rate at 5.25 percent, I believe we would have risked oversteering our course and potentially run afoul of the shoals of unacceptably slow economic growth. Those of you who know me are aware that I am a compulsive worrier about inflation—I do not know any central banker in the world worth his or her salt who is not—because I see inflation as the bête noire, or bugbear, of any successful economy. Recent trends in inflationary impulses and expectations, however, appeared to me to provide some wiggle room to adjust our tiller and steer a more growth-oriented course.\n\nLooking to the other shoreline, we were confronting the rocky outcropping that economists call moral hazard. From these rocks, one could hear the siren call of market operators and institutions that had made imprudent decisions and now hoped the Fed would rescue them with easy money. Overcorrecting our course with too aggressive a shift in the fed funds tiller would have, I believe, undermined the discipline that market forces impose upon wayward financial institutions and investors. Moral hazard is a dangerous predicament for any central bank. Yet we had an unsettled money market riddled with angst—a money market that, in my view, was going into a defensive crouch in which even the best and most careful depository institutions and market operators feared that the positions taken by their less prudent brethren may come up a cropper and seize up the entire financial system.\n \nThose were the conditions on the financial seas when we met last Tuesday. As with any navigator of turbulent seas, the FOMC relies on an impressive array of instruments; we are blessed with a rich complement of superb economists and a fulsome dashboard of databases. But in the end, no models or formulas substitute for judgment in making monetary policy. The course of monetary policy is a matter of discernment—akin to the decisions made by a ship captain who knows that steering through a turbulent sea requires drawing on more than just charts and computerized navigation equipment. Drawing upon its best judgment, the committee chose to navigate the passage with a 50-basis-point reduction in base rates, following its Aug. 17 action to reduce the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate.\n\nWith any publicly visible decision made at an important juncture, second-guessers pop up everywhere. Market operators and countless others, among them somber as well as bombastic television commentators—armchair navigators, if you will—have been eager to discuss the course we have chosen. This is the nature of a free market for commentary. Personally, I welcome it, as it sharpens our wits.\n\nCentral banking is not and never should be a popularity contest. It is a serious duty undertaken by earnest public servants for the greatest good of the nation. Thus, FOMC members will continue taking in-depth soundings on the progress of the economy and the financial markets as we evaluate the impact of the 50-basis-point course correction. Should further correction—either to port or to starboard—be needed to stay on the course toward sustainable, noninflationary growth over time, we will make it.\n \nEnough about navigation and last Tuesday’s FOMC meeting. I will happily take any questions about policy during the question-and-answer period and, in classic Federal Reserve style, do my best not to answer them.\n\nToday, I want to talk about a subject that is of the utmost importance to Dallas’ future—higher education and why we need to focus on developing the academic and intellectual excellence needed to make this the great city we all want it to be.\n\nThe vital capital stock of our modern economy is not our buildings or our factories or our farms. It is our brains. It is our ability to conjure new and better ideas, inventions and solutions. It is our commitment to exceptional customer service. It is our designs for better buildings, faster computers and more successful space flights. It manifests itself in new financing products and medical breakthroughs, in mathematical formulas and biochemical experimentation, in physics and engineering and design.\n\nEducation and knowledge are the driving forces of a U.S. economy. Remember that agriculture represents less than 2 percent of our national economy and manufacturing employs just 11 percent of our workforce. Only 5 percent of our fellow Americans work in the mining and construction sectors.\n\nEighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of the nation’s most prestigious and highest-paying jobs—jobs very much like yours. In Texas, for example, average hourly wages in 2005 were $77.23 for doctors of internal medicine, $44.81 for geological engineers, $39.53 for computer software engineers and $26.35 for registered nurses.[1]\n\nJobs like these can be done only by workers with highly specialized skills, nurtured by our educational system and honed by years of experience. Physical strength and manual dexterity, workers’ primary input for so much of what was produced in the agricultural and manufacturing eras, have been replaced by creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence. We prosper by the work of our brow, not the labor of our muscle.\n\nLet me give you a stark example: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent of the value to our gross domestic product. The legal services sector employed nearly the same number but contributed 1.5 percent of the value added to GDP. In other words, lawyers produce twice as much as automobile workers. Granted, that may not come as much consolation when you open your attorney’s bill, but those are the facts. There is no more vivid demonstration of how services have replaced manufacturing as the engine of our economic prosperity.\n\nMy friend Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, once quipped that “there are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t.” Yet even mathematically challenged economists are united on this: In the service sector-driven Knowledge Age, education pays huge dividends.\n\nIn today’s economy, you earn what you learn. Spending time and money learning—in gathering knowledge and skills—remains one of the best investments you can make. In 2006, an average 25-year-old high school graduate made $6,100 a year more than someone the same age who dropped out. A high school graduate who went on to college but didn’t get a degree saw earnings rise by another $4,160. Earning an associate’s degree added another $3,100. A bachelor’s degree was worth an additional $15,260. A law, dentistry or other professional degree added $32,300 to earnings. The total, the difference in earnings between a 25-year-old high school dropout and a 25-year-old degreed professional, was almost $61,000 a year.\n\nJust as impressive is the way experience in the workplace compounds the benefits of higher education. The $61,000 earnings gap between high school dropouts and professional degree holders jumps to more than $100,000 by the time these 25-year-olds reach age 60—a 66 percent widening.\n\nWe also see links between educational attainment and job stability, with the best educated among us enjoying the lowest unemployment rates.\n\nYou earn what you learn.\n\nOf course, intellectual capital, like its physical counterpart, can depreciate over time. Skills can fade or be replaced by new technologies and as our economy evolves. Think back just 30 years and you’ll remember that our labor pool included a profession called “typists.” My mother was one of them. Thousands like her earned their livings at clattering keyboards, producing the documents needed in business and government, but their once-rare skills have become nearly universal among computer users worldwide. Or consider medicine. Who among you would feel comfortable with a doctor who stopped learning after medical school and treated you with the principles and procedures of decades past? You expect doctors to be up on the latest research, newest procedures and best medicines to treat you. In today’s knowledge-driven world, none of us can ever claim to know enough. We must embrace lifetime learning if we are to prosper.\n\nIn a modern economy, we can no more deny the link between brainpower and income than we can deny that the Federal Reserve is subject to scrutiny. We see the link between education and earnings appear across countries, among individuals and among states. Little old Massachusetts, for example, with a third-place ranking in college graduates per capita, has lifted itself up to first in per capita income. California’s 11th-place ranking in education gets it 10th in per capita income. And Texas? Texas ranks 29th in college graduates and 29th in per capita income, well below the national leaders.\n\nOur neighbor, Arkansas, ranks 49th in both education and income. Mississippi is 50th in income, a few notches below West Virginia, which is 50th in education. Imagine that: We are closer to Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia in educational attainment and income than we are to Massachusetts. I’ve got nothing against the Razorbacks, Ole Miss or the Mountaineers, but that is not where I want Texas to be.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the Dallas metroplex? Well, let me paint a picture for you. The Dallas–Fort Worth area is the country’s eighth-most-populous metropolitan region and its fifth-most economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population, surpassed only by California.\n\nTexas has six public university systems. The University of Texas System is the granddaddy of them all, with 190,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. Its flagship is UT Austin. The Texas A&M System has nine universities, with 103,000 students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman’s are independent public universities. All told, we have about 520,000 students attending the more than 40 public universities in our state.\n\nBy contrast, California has more than 600,000 students enrolled at just 33 public universities. The pinnacle of the state’s educational system is the University of California, with 209,000 students spread over 10 universities. The system includes some of the best universities in the world—UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.\n\nHow do our institutions of higher learning stack up against California and the rest of the nation? According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Davis all outranked UT Austin for overall educational excellence. UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara were tied with UT—at 44th. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M fell two spots to 62nd, tied with Worcester Polytechnic in Massachusetts. Worcester Polytechnic. Ever heard of it? Southern Methodist University ranked 67th, Baylor University 75th and Texas Christian University 108th. Rice University came in 17th, right up there with Emory University and Johns Hopkins and above Berkeley and Notre Dame.\n\nImagine that! The “overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state” of California has within one fleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our top public university.\n\nNow let’s broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American Universities, regarded by most scholars as the imprimatur of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU is an exclusive group of the top 60 research universities in the United States. Those 60 U.S. schools garner about 60 percent of all federal R&D dollars and are home to 82 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1999, three-quarters of all Nobel Prizes were won by faculty members at those AAU universities. No doubt, everyone in this room would like to have many of our Texas universities included in this prestigious group.\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Caltech, Stanford and USC. Four of those are in the greater Los Angeles area alone. New York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. (You actually should add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm’s reach of New York City.)\n\nAnd within the 262,000 square miles of Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state you and I love to brag and boast about, a state of 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as the city of Boston. And Dallas, my hometown, has none. Dallas, the eighth-largest metropolitan area in America, doesn’t have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT Southwestern Medical Center, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\n\nWhen a university is a reputed fountainhead, the best and brightest minds flock to it and foundations, philanthropists and other agencies feel confident that their donations will be put to good use. I read a study published 10 years ago or so that found more than 4,000 companies had been started by alumni or faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Imagine how many more successful companies have been founded by MIT alumni in the decade since that study, a decade marked by the very sorts of high-tech innovations that many MIT grads are so well trained to master. It is little wonder that MIT attracts the highest-caliber students and teachers and substantial research funding.\n\nIncidentally, Texas Instruments was one of those MIT companies, whose founders also founded the predecessor to UT Dallas with the explicit aim of creating “the MIT of the Southwest.”\n\nCecil Green and Eugene McDermott and the other founders of UTD understood that the economic value generated by a university is tremendous. Universities earn some money from licensing out their patents, but the lion’s share of the economic boom comes from the people they educate, the ideas they cultivate, the companies they start and the research they do that spills out into the economy. More often than not, it is the university’s local community that most directly benefits from these overflows.\n\nMalcolm Gillis, a former member of the Dallas Fed board of directors and the immediate past president of Rice in Houston, shared with me an interesting fact about his university. A few years ago, he noticed that about 15 percent of undergrads were from local Harris County high schools, while nearly 33 percent of alumni lived in the county. In other words, bright and motivated people came to Houston because of the university and stayed for the job opportunities available to them upon graduation. Many of the jobs are in high-tech, knowledge-driven industries for which Rice and its alumni have laid the foundation.\n\nDallas does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by either U.S. News & World Report or the Association of American Universities. Our local university leaders—good men like Gerald Turner at SMU, David Daniel at UT Dallas, Kern Wildenthal at UT Southwestern, Victor Boschini at TCU and Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington—are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs. They need commitments and resources from the state and local community if they are to give this metropolitan area what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or in Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, or what Massachusetts has in Cambridge, and yes, even Worcester.\n\nHow can we expect Dallas and North Texas to prosper in the Knowledge Age—the era in which economic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established fountainhead of advanced knowledge?\n\nWhen you leave this symposium today, I want you to look around Dallas’ cityscape. You won’t see factories with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass-and-steel buildings that warehouse the capital plant of the modern era: human brains. Brains that do research and provide services in medicine, marketing, finance and myriad other fields.\n\nTexas boomed with the discovery of vast petroleum deposits, first in the eastern part of the state, then in the west. Oil wells eventually run dry. An educated mind never does.\n\nTo be sure, we can fuel our local economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its commitment to building Big D.\n\nWe live in a globalized economy. Goods, services, money, ideas and people move across borders. How do we compete with the masses of Chinese and Indians and Eastern Europeans and Vietnamese and Mexicans and Latin Americans who will grow by making stuff so much cheaper than we can? How do we stay ahead of them as they continue up the value-added ladder into the service sector, into technology, into programming and into software and the sciences?\n\nHere’s how: We move even faster up the value-added ladder. How do we do that? By using our brains—what my father used to describe simply as “the little one-quart jar between your ears.”\n\nJust as farming and oil and gas and manufacturing once drove Texas’ economic development, an educated workforce with high earning potential will propel the future of our city, our state, our great nation and the world. The ultimate source of competitive advantage for Texas is not oil. It is not gas or the chemical industry. It is not even the Dallas Cowboys, even if they are America’s Team. Our ability to compete and thrive in the future—our ability to navigate into a prosperous future—will be determined by our elementary and secondary schools, our community colleges, our medical, law and engineering schools and research centers, and by our public and private universities. Education should be the highest priority of our community. It should be the most important priority of anybody who cares about the future of Dallas.\n\nThe North Dallas Chamber of Commerce knows how to sell. The people in this audience can sell better than anybody on the planet—you do it for a living. So do yourselves a favor. Go out and sell the fact that we need a world-class university, be it public or private, right here, right now. If you cannot use your considerable talent to do so, then woe is the future of our beloved city.",

        "content": "September 10, 2007 Laredo, Texas\n\nIt is an enormous pleasure to be back in Laredo. I spent a great deal of time here in 1993 and 1994, when I strayed from the path of righteousness and made a feeble run for the U.S. Senate. Wading into the cold and brackish waters of politics can be a gloomy experience, but there are rays of bright sunshine that provide a lifetime of warm memories. One of the brightest rays in my mercifully brief political career was Laredo.\n\nI recall most fondly the Washington's Birthday Celebration weekends. I loved it when the powers that be here selected Ann Richards as Mr. South Texas—a deft touch that showed Laredo manages to combine respect for tradition with a cutting-edge sense of modernity, and do it with sass en broma. And I loved the splendor and pageantry of the Colonial Ball, with all those beautiful young women in those magnificent and phenomenally expensive dresses.\n\nI am not the first and certainly won't be the last to be overwhelmed by the generosity of the big-hearted people of this dynamic border city, including that of our remarkable director from Laredo, Memo Trevino. I see many friendly faces here today, including Rosanne Palacios and Alberto and Lucy Cardenas, among so many others. Alberto and Lucy are the parents of Beto. Beto drove me around and traveled with me during my Senate campaign against Kay Bailey Hutchison. That was 13 years ago. Today, Beto works for Senator Hutchison, proof that time really does heal all wounds.\n\nHaving just mentioned the Colonial Ball, I can't help but single out the LaMantias. Steve and Linda have five precious girls. It was not for nothing that after the birth of Molly, the fifth daughter, Steve's dad, Joe, gave the family a dog named Boy. In the back of his mind, Papa Joe was likely discounting the future cost of five dresses for the Colonial Ball. And as true as my friendship is for the LaMantia family, he knew it would have been a bit much for me to argue for loosening monetary policy in order to accommodate outfitting those five LaMantia girls.\n\nI want to start today with a few observations about the U.S. economy before turning to the subject of Mexico and our border economy. I remind you that, as always, I speak only for myself and neither for the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—nor the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Current Predicament of the U.S. Economy\n\nIn recent weeks, we have heard much about financial market turbulence. We've been distracted by the noise of the subprime fallout, periodic reports of a \"seizing up\" in asset-backed commercial paper markets, volatility in the stock market and tremors in other parts of the financial infrastructure. (Apparently it is no longer true that, as Andrew Mellon once famously quipped, \"Gentlemen prefer bonds.\") Amidst this clamor and drama, some might have lost sight of our economy's great resiliency. In the first quarter of 2007, U.S. GDP rose despite sharp declines in housing and automobile production. Then second-quarter growth rebounded to a 4 percent annual rate, which is considerable for a $13 trillion economy; in the second quarter alone, Americans produced $130 billion in incremental output. Much of the renewed strength came from net exports benefiting from a still-growing, historically dynamic global economy, a reminder that our flexible, highly diverse economy has many sources of growth. With a solid second quarter and low unemployment, the U.S. economy entered the second half of the year with good forward momentum. Given the financial turmoil that began last month, I am generally encouraged by what I have heard and seen so far: As yet, tighter credit conditions do not appear to have had a major impact on overall economic activity outside of real estate.\n\nAs we approach the upcoming session of the FOMC, each of the participants, including me, is diving deep into the data and taking soundings from business leaders, bankers and others with operating ears to the ground to ascertain the current pace of the economy and—this is important—the prospective dynamics of growth and inflation. I am particularly active on this front. Before each meeting, I speak with around 30 CEOs and CFOs of a careful selection of large and small companies from around the country in order to get an in-depth understanding of the pace of economic growth and price pressures they see through their businesses. Meanwhile, our staff routinely surveys a broad base of businesses within our district and reports their findings in what is known as the Beige Book, the most recent of which was released last Wednesday. Lately, I have focused on how recent developments in financial markets are impacting the revenues and costs, supplier and customer dynamics, product mix and growth projections of these hands-on operators of our economy. I am only partway along in studying the entrails of the Beige Book and a third of the way through my CEO and CFO conversations and have not yet reached any conclusions. However, it is fair to say that I am encouraged by what I have heard against a background of constant negative speculation and the occasional discordant note, such as last week's employment numbers. Our economy appears to be weathering the storm thus far. The future path of that storm and the appropriate policy course, however, are still to be determined.\n\nAt a recent Jackson Hole retreat for central bankers and economists, Ned Gramlich, a much-revered and very wise former Fed governor who sadly succumbed to leukemia on Wednesday, reminded us in a speech that America's economic progress has been punctuated with booms and busts. The 19th century had its canal, railroad and mineral booms. The 20th century had its rushes of financial innovation and new technology. Each boom was followed by a collapse when prices could no longer keep up. \"When the dust clears,\" Gramlich wrote, \"there is financial carnage, many investors learning to be more careful next time, but there are often the fruits of the boom still around to benefit productivity…. The canals and railroads are still there and functional, the minerals are discovered and in use, the financing innovations stay and we still have the Internet and all its capabilities.\" The fruits of the subprime market boom, he reminded us, are the millions of low-income and minority borrowers who now own their own homes and are successfully making their payments and building equity for the future.\n\nKeep this in mind as the housing market corrects and the new financial instruments spawned by the housing boom and turbocharged financial technology continue seeking more rational price levels—levels that will be determined not by ersatz valuation models and unsustainable return assumptions, but by the market's discipline in equilibrating supply and demand. A great many families who would never have had access to the ultimate fruit of the American harvest—homeownership—were able to achieve that dream because of the housing boom.\n\nAnd what about the \"bust\" side of the equation, what Gramlich referred to as the \"financial carnage\"? I managed a hedge fund for 10 years before selling my interests in 1997, as I wound up a banking and asset-management career that had started in 1975. I know from experience that markets are manic-depressive, subject to enormous mood swings. They overshoot on the upside in periods of enthusiasm and on the downside when reality sets in. During the inevitable corrections, there are always cries of anguish—and no paucity of self-serving policy recommendations—from financial market operators who exploited a boom and then let complacency or greed get the better of their judgment. Reward is commensurate with risk, and risk is a double-edged sword. I do not believe the Federal Reserve's job is to protect specific risk takers who failed to protect themselves from potential downside wounds. The Federal Reserve's job is to protect the system itself. My colleagues and I take that responsibility very seriously.\n\nPeople always ask what guides me when I sit at the Federal Open Market Committee table. The FOMC is a deliberative body, and monetary policy is a judgmental business in the end. It is a complex and serious business. To live up to what is expected of us, we have to make considered judgments and not react to the latest data point or the \"instant analysis\" that is ubiquitous on the Internet or in the news media or among the countless financial analysts who pump out commentary like water from a fire hydrant. \"Instant analysis\" is a wonderful oxymoron—a true contradiction in terms, like \"jumbo shrimp\" or \"funny economist\"—but hardly the stuff of serious deliberation.\n\nWhat guides me at the table is pretty straightforward. One of my four children is here today, my son Miles. Whenever I sit at the FOMC table, I am mindful that the entire transcript of our deliberations will be released in five years. I think about what Miles and his brother and sisters will think when they read their father's words in a historical context, removed from whatever the press and the markets may be clamoring about at the time of the meeting. I am guided first and foremost by a desire for my children to be proud of their dad; to be judged by them as well as by economic historians as having been wise rather than too smart by half, as having a steady hand rather than an itchy trigger finger. I set aside the passions of the moment and the conventional wisdom in the markets and keep a steady focus on the Fed's mission: to conduct monetary policy so as to achieve long-term, noninflationary economic growth for the great capitalist machine that is the United States of America. Conducting monetary policy is not a popularity contest.\n\nAll of this is a long way of saying that, in my humble opinion, the standard tools of monetary policy are insufficient, by themselves, to deal with the subprime market fallout. The best course, as Ned Gramlich reminded us, is to minimize the future threat to the economy while taking care not to strangle financial innovation and its benefits. He reckoned that over half the subprime mortgage loans in recent years were made by independent lenders who were not subject to federal supervision. Virtually all prime market loans, by contrast, are made by federally supervised banks and thrifts or their affiliates. Gramlich pointed out that \"[i]n the prime market, where we need supervision less, we have lots of it,\" whereas \"in the subprime market, where we badly need supervision, a majority of loans are made with very little supervision.\"\n\nMy guess is that a great deal of the potential dislocation resulting from corrective reactions to the subprime boom will be resolved by regulatory initiatives rather than by monetary policy. Yet it is important to remember that regulatory reforms are like a vaccine—better at preventing sickness than at curing it. Much of the solution for the current pathology lies in the curative workings of the financial markets. I suspect the markets will be unsparing in their treatment of the most egregious of those who engaged in risky financial behavior. There is little that regulation can or should do to interfere with letting that treatment run its course.\n\nAny new regulations that might now be crafted to prevent future recurrences must be well thought out, for two reasons. First, financial institutions will quickly adapt to defeat any regulation that is poorly designed, morphing into new, vaccine-resistant strains. Second, heavy-handed regulations are sometimes worse than the disease against which they are meant to protect. I would be wary of any regulatory initiatives that interfere with market discipline and attempts to protect risk takers from the consequences of bad decisions for fear of creating a moral hazard that might endanger the long-term health of our economic and financial system simply to provide momentary relief.\n\nOn that happy note, I want to shift the focus of my remarks today and comment on the U.S.–Mexico economic relationship.\n\nThe Mexican Economy\n\nHere on the Texas–Mexico border, you are used to paying as much attention to Mexico as the U.S. I do, too, in no small part because of my personal history. The country provided refuge to my immigrant parents between 1939 and 1947 as they waited to become U.S. citizens. Two years after I was born in Los Angeles, we were off to Mexico City, where I was educated through primary school and developed a love for all things Mexican. Apart from my sentimental childhood attachment, my economic perspective on Mexico was forged in part by the four years I spent as deputy U.S. trade representative in the Clinton administration, negotiating with Mexico on the implementation of NAFTA. Back then, the official coordination of infrastructure issues, regulations and other policies needed to maximize the gains from free trade was done between the nations' capitals. But I never forgot that the cities and towns along the border, from the mouth of the Rio Grande to San Diego's beaches, were, and continue to be, ground zero for the economic integration of Mexico and the U.S.\n\nI like to say that Mexico and the United States are joined at the hip, especially when it comes to the two nations' economies. Three-fifths of Mexico's imports, most of which are manufactured goods, are from the U.S., and two-thirds of all foreign direct investment into Mexico comes from U.S. investors. More than 90 percent of Mexico's exports are destined for the United States. Mexican workers provide a significant part of the economic muscle that makes the U.S. economy so mighty, and Mexico is a critical part of our industrial base, feeding the supply lines of American businesses. It is, therefore, vitally important for the Dallas Fed to keep a watchful eye on the economic goings-on of its southern neighbor.\n\nWhat are we seeing across the border?\n\nDespite healthy internal consumer demand supported by much-improved credit conditions, we see a Mexican economy experiencing slower growth this year, largely due to a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and a weak first quarter. Mexico's second-quarter GDP growth picked up, however, and the rest of this year is expected to bring faster overall growth although a slowing in U.S. manufacturing, fallout from the credit markets situation or other factors such as less foreign direct investment and further weakness in remittances could upset the more optimistic forecasts for the Mexican economy during the rest of 2007.\n\nRecent price developments could dampen prospects as well. Consumer price inflation has been slightly above Banco de México's target range for a few months because of a run-up in commodity and food prices. However, Mexican inflation has been at historic lows in recent years, which continues to benefit workers and consumers. Inflation is an onerous tax and a disincentive to work, save and invest. In an economy plagued by rising prices, a dollar saved ends up a quarter earned, a fact that does not change if you deal in pesos and centavos. Thankfully, the Mexican economy continues to benefit under the superb leadership of Guillermo Ortíz at Banco de México. The central bank has elected to stand pat since April, anticipating that inflation is on a slow downward trend. Nevertheless, prices spiked in July, and inflation expectations among economic and financial agents may be a bit too high.\n\nShort-term obstacles, however, are not Mexico's foremost concern. Much more worrisome is the fact that long-term growth remains hampered by persistent structural impediments. And yet the Banco de México, having used its constitutionally guaranteed independence to subdue distracting inflationary impulses and peso devaluations, has liberated President Calderón's government and the Mexican Congress to finally deal with these vexing issues.\n\nInvestments in education are beginning to pay off, but schooling is still inadequate in many parts of the country. Property rights aren't enforced as well as they should be, creating difficulties for lending and investing. The sprawling informal sector that employs more than 20 million people—from low-skilled workers to entrepreneurs discouraged by the formal sector's burdensome regulations and taxes—creates significant inefficiency. Widespread tax evasion limits Mexico's ability to raise revenue, a hurdle for needed investment in education and infrastructure. In the energy sector, production and distribution are under government control and, given Mexico's limited fiscal resources, future oil-producing capacity is a cause for concern.\n\nThe obstacles I've just enumerated are well documented and well understood by Mexican authorities. There is no need for me to dwell on them today. It is important to emphasize the tremendous progress the country has made over the past two decades in several key areas. Mexico embraced free trade in the mid-1980s and strengthened its economic roots with its northern neighbors and got its fiscal and monetary affairs in order in the 1990s. Since then, the transformation has been remarkable. Mexico has become an open economy with a steadfast dedication to policy discipline and macroeconomic stability. Gone are the days when election-year turmoil invariably brought Mexico's economy to its knees.\n\nAnother interesting development is in Mexican financial markets. Hard-earned macroeconomic stability has brought momentous change to Mexico's once-backward financial services sector, giving birth to a dynamic industry that, after a slow start, now offers a full menu of banking and investment services and increasing lending capacity. Mexican and Spanish banks are even buying banks in Texas and other U.S. border states to tap the large and growing Mexican population living on both sides and cater to their demand for dollar-denominated accounts and other specialized services.\n\nThe next frontier for Mexico is the implementation of structural reforms. There is much debate over just what the reforms should look like. Difficult as the process may be, Mexico must redouble its efforts to implement needed reforms.\n\nMexico and Texas\n\nA few moments ago, I used the image of the U.S. and Mexico being joined at the hip. If so, that makes Texas the hipbone that connects them. The border economy is unique. The combination of maquiladoras, agriculture, cross-border trade and the region's binational labor pool has let the Rio Grande Valley, Laredo and El Paso enjoy solid growth, even during slowdowns elsewhere in the U.S. and Mexico. Texas' border cities have one foot in Mexico and one foot in the U.S., with growth linked to economic conditions on both sides. The close ties to Mexico have allowed Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo to rank among the country's fastest-growing areas since 1990 in terms of population and jobs, and border unemployment rates have dropped to record lows. A large and rapidly growing labor force and low education levels, however, have meant that border wages have remained low relative to the national average. Still, there are signs of improvement. Since 2000, average wages on the border have outpaced state and U.S. wage growth. And in 2006, median hourly wages increased faster in the Rio Grande Valley than in the state or the nation.\n\nMaquiladoras and trade-related transportation infrastructure have long been engines of economic growth along both sides of the border. Export-related manufacturers on the Mexican side have gained steadily, drawing on a constant stream of migrating workers from southern Mexico and complementary component and material suppliers on the U.S. side. While the emphasis is still industrial on the Mexican side, the U.S. side is a services economy, with retail and health care making significant gains in jobs and activity here in South Texas. Why? Job growth and a strong peso have improved the purchasing power of the Mexican consumer. Texas' proximity to Monterrey, Mexico's second wealthiest city, and prosperous maquiladoras along the border have also meant an increase in shopping trips to Texas. This is not news to anyone in this room. Between 1978 and 2001, Mexican nationals accounted for an estimated 53 percent of Laredo's retail sales.\n\nA positive development along the border has been an explosion in its health care industry over the past 10 years. Like retail and banking, health care is a service that is in demand by Mexican nationals and by the burgeoning population of U.S. retirees in Mexico. Hospitals and home health care agencies are expanding at rapid rates and, along with growth in education and federal government jobs in Border Patrol and Customs, are providing high-paying employment to border residents.\n\nWhile almost all Texas border cities have deep ties with Mexico, their linkages can be quite different, and their economies respond accordingly to changing conditions in Mexico. Our research has found that, typically, sharp declines in the peso result in economic downturns in Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville. Each has retail sectors that depend heavily on Mexican shoppers, so swings in the peso can have big impacts. The strong and stable peso—thanks to the 1994 constitutional reform that gave Banco de México the independence it has so ably applied in recent years—is a big piece of the puzzle that explains robust growth in Laredo and the Valley.\n\nThe outlook continues to be favorable for border population and job growth, both in Texas and the states to our west. Real progress, however, will require greater productivity and increased wages. The ultimate source of income growth and prosperity originates with human capacity and education, the development of which should be the highest priority of this community. It should be the highest priority of this state.\n\nEducation and Immigrants\n\nWe never know enough in today's world and must embrace lifetime learning to achieve the American Dream. Our chief economist at the Dallas Fed, Mike Cox, likes to say, \"You earn what you learn.\" The U.S. economy today is far different from the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and factories. Agriculture represents 2 percent of our national economy. Manufacturing employs only 11 percent of our workforce. Construction and mining represent 5 percent. Eighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of the nation's most prestigious and highest-paying jobs.\n\nMy friend Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, once quipped that \"there are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can't.\" Yet even mathematically challenged economists are united on this: Education pays off. There is an irrefutable positive link between education and income. Wages are low on the border because education levels are low. We see this link across states, across countries, between individuals and in America's progress over time.\n\nSpending on education is an investment in our children. But that takes time, and we in Texas and the U.S. have meanwhile added to our intellectual capital in another way. We import educated workers from other countries and do what we can to retain foreign students who come to study here. Along the U.S.–Mexico border, you know this well. Throughout its history, the region has benefited from tapping the human capital of northern Mexico's border states, which have some of Mexico's finest universities.\n\nLet me give you an example of the \"you earn what you learn\" principle from our San Antonio branch board of directors. To do so, I am going to embarrass Dr. G. P. Singh, who is an American success story, combining education with entrepreneurship. As a boy in his native India, G. P. studied diligently, earning a spot in the Punjab Engineering College. Like so many foreigners, he continued his education in the U.S., earning a doctorate at Drexel University. In time, Dr. Singh came to San Antonio and started his own engineering business—Karta Technologies—a company he just sold for a cool $65 million.\n \nDr. Singh's is a perfect example of how immigrant-founded firms are furthering the technological prowess of the U.S. economy. According to a recent study by researchers at Duke University and UC Berkeley, immigrants were listed as inventors or co-inventors on 24 percent of all U.S. patent applications in 2006, up from only 7 percent in 1998. Of all the science and technology companies established in the United States between 1995 and 2005, 25 percent had at least one foreign-born founder.\n\nMost important, G. P. is a case study of how to convert learning to earning and how to harness the brain to create economic prosperity. We must foster conditions that allow a child from Laredo—or from any other city in Texas or the U.S. or from Mexico City or Nuevo Laredo or from Punjab in faraway India—to succeed in the economic promised land called America. With a well-educated workforce, no market correction, no interruption of the orderly working of financial markets and no apocryphal prognostication of the \"instant analysts\" or even of humorless economists can dislodge us from our position as the world's mightiest economic machine.\n\nWith that, I will end today's sermon.\n\nAnd now in keeping with Federal Reserve tradition, I would be happy to not answer any questions you might have.\n\nAndamos, pues. Thank you.",

        "content": "August 25, 2007 Biloxi, Mississippi\n\nThank you, Governor Barbour. I was rather enjoying your introduction until you mentioned the 1994 Senate race, a misguided adventure from a previous life. We at the Fed are sticklers for accurate data, so I need to issue a correction: I received 1,639,615 votes in 1994, which computes to 38.309 percent—roughly. About the only thing I was able to accomplish in that race was eating a dipped cone in every Dairy Queen in the Lone Star State—all 700-plus of them. Texas ended up with a fine senator in Kay Hutchison and, despite all those ice cream cones and Hunger-Busters, I managed to shed 20 pounds. It was a win–win experience. At least that's my story and I'm sticking to it.\n \nYou all know that we at the Fed are nonpartisan. Once you enter the \"Temple,\" as some call it, you check your politics at the door. I joined up a couple of years ago and, like all Fed presidents, have refrained from political commentary since crossing that threshold. But I think it right and proper to say that what you have done here, Governor, in Biloxi and throughout Mississippi in the aftermath of Katrina's fury is impressive. I am honored to have been introduced by you and to meet with the Southern Governors' Association.\n\nMy district covers Texas, 26 parishes in Governor Blanco's state and 18 counties in New Mexico. It is a productive district, just like those covered by the Atlanta Fed and the St. Louis Fed—by Dennis's [Lockhart] and Bill's [Poole] banks—and the Richmond, Cleveland and Kansas City Feds, all of which have portions of the Greater South in their districts but are not represented here today. The governors of the Southern states, along with Dennis and Bill and me, with Jeff Lacker in Richmond, Sandy Pianalto in Cleveland and Tom Hoenig in Kansas City, serve a mighty swath of the U.S. economy. The American public reads almost daily about the great economic power rising on the far side of the Pacific. Well, you might remind your constituents and the press every now and then that the 16 states that you govern and that my colleagues and I serve, all told, produce a combined output that is 76 percent greater than China's. Let me do the calculation in a different way: For every dollar's worth of output that China produces, the hardworking constituents of your states produce $1.76. The South is an economic juggernaut.\n\nHow do we keep growing this mighty economic force? How does the South stay ahead of China and India and all the others who are knocking at the door, wanting economic prosperity?\n\nFirst, we must acknowledge that we live in a cyber-enhanced, interconnected, inextricably interdependent global economy. The Southern economy is no longer confined by lines drawn on a map; it is no more removed from countries and markets at the far ends of the Earth than it is from the rest of the United States. We live in a globalized economy, knitted together by Knowledge Age technologies. Until the Industrial Revolution, economies were largely local, confined mostly to cities and towns. The butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker were within a day's walk or horseback ride. Then came railroads, industry, telephones, cars, highways, television and the Internet. With each successive technological innovation, our economic activities expanded beyond our towns and states and regions, allowing us more choices in determining our destinies and bringing more difficulties in devising local and regional government economic policies. Sir Anthony Eden, the prime minister who succeeded Winston Churchill, said to the House of Commons in 1945, \"Every succeeding scientific discovery makes greater nonsense of old-time conceptions of sovereignty.\" He was dead-on.\n\nWhat happens around the world affects us in the Southern states, just as what happens in each of your states influences investment decisions and economic activity around the world. We all know how devastating a fierce hurricane can be at the local level, destroying homes and businesses and disrupting millions of lives. Dislocations caused by a storm in the U.S. ripple around the globe: The Gulf's vast oil and gas activity shuts down, causing world energy prices to rise and leaving drivers in Boston, Bulgaria and Brazil with less money in their pockets.\n\nWhen a Mississippi manufacturing company closes its Gulfport factory and moves it to Guangdong, China, in pursuit of lowering its costs, it hurts. The press, with its local emphasis, focuses on the downside. And you, as governors, feel the brunt of your citizens' anger. And yet you know and I know that Chinese workers at that new factory many thousands of miles from here now make more money than they did before. As they grow more prosperous, the Chinese can afford to consume more, and so they start spending their hard-earned yuan at the neighborhood Wal-Mart—good news for Governor Beebe—or on bottles of Jack Daniel's—good news for Governor Bredesen—or perhaps on once-in-a-lifetime vacations to Disney World—good news for Governor Crist—or on soybeans grown in Texas—good news for my friend Governor Perry, who is well aware that China is one of the fastest-growing destinations for shipments leaving Houston's port. So intertwined are the world's economies that disentangling the web would be, as Bill Poole just pointed out, disastrously expensive, counterproductive and entirely fruitless. It takes extraordinary political leadership to accommodate globalization.\n\nOver the decades, the inexorable march of capitalist evolution has shifted our economy's base from agriculture to manufacturing and now to services. This is important to understand as we contemplate the South's future. As people get richer, they shift their spending away from goods and toward services. For every dollar Americans spend on goods, we spend $1.70 on services. Ours is not a goods-based economy anymore—we grow and ship to the world a veritable cornucopia of crops, but agriculture represents only 1.5 percent of our economy. We build at a furious pace and mine our rich store of natural resources, but construction and mining represent only 5.5 percent of our economy. We are a manufacturing powerhouse, and yet factory output represents only around 11 percent of our economy. Services account for 82 percent of our economic output. Let me repeat that: 82 percent of our economic output comes from the service sector.\n\nGiven your professional background, Mr. Chairman, you may be interested in one fact that illustrates the importance of the service sector: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent to our GDP. The legal services sector had nearly the same workforce—a little over a million lawyers inhabit America—but they contributed 1.5 percent to GDP. Lawyers produce twice as much as automobile workers. So much for lawyer jokes.\n\nObviously, services differ from goods in the job skills they require. Physical strength and manual dexterity, workers' primary input for so much of what was produced in the agricultural and manufacturing eras, have been replaced by creativity, reasoning and emotional intelligence. We prosper by the work of our brow, not the labor of our muscle. The capital stock of our modern economy is not our buildings or our factories or our farms. It is our brains. It is our ability to think of new ideas, inventions and solutions. It is our commitment to customer service at this fine resort and millions of other places. It is our designs for new buildings, new computers or a space module. It manifests itself in new financing products or medical breakthroughs or the entertainment industry.\n\nThe great economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the term creative destruction. This seemingly contradictory phrase comes, by the way, from an economist who had a knack for the clever quip. One of our former Fed governors, Dewey Daane, is a constituent of Governor Bredesen. He lives up there in Nashville. As a Harvard student back in the 1940s, he was taught by Schumpeter. He reports that the first day of class, Schumpeter walked in the room and said: \"When I was young, I wanted to be the greatest economist in the world, the world's greatest lover and the best horseman on earth. I have not done well with the horses.\"\n\nIn his pursuit of the first of those three grand goals, Professor Schumpeter wrote that \"stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.\" He was right: Capitalism is far from stable, and it is never dull. It is constantly transforming the economic landscape. And the American genius has time and again mastered that transformation—rather than be victimized by it.\n\nThe destructive side of capitalism's creative destruction is evident in lost jobs. Let me share a few numbers for the states you govern. The number of workers in apparel manufacturing in your states decreased 80 percent between 1990 and 2005. In the same 15-year period, payrolls fell 18 percent at paper manufacturers and 15 percent for furniture makers. The number of farm workers decreased 6 percent, and the number of mine workers declined 5 percent. That is pretty painful stuff. And it is not ancient history. It all occurred within a time frame that is fresh in the memory of everyone in this room—between 1990 and 2005.\n\nAnd yet, despite these employment losses, each state in the Southern region now has a larger job base than it did in 1990. North Carolina, for example, has created 1 million net new jobs since 1990. Texas' employment has risen by more than 3 million since 1990.\n\nWhy? Because the creative side of creative destruction outpaced the destructive side. Your economies replaced lost jobs in declining sectors with new ones in emerging, higher-value-added sectors. Between 1990 and 2005, the number of data processing and Internet service provider workers in Southern states increased 65 percent. Professional services workers grew 63 percent. Financial services employees increased 31 percent. Retail employment grew 23 percent. By 2005, the financial and real estate services sectors employed as many Southern workers as the manufacturing sector. Lodging and food services accounted for the same share of the Southern workforce as construction.\n\nHealth care sector employment in the South alone grew by 2.3 million from 1990 to 2005. Let me put that in perspective: For every manufacturing job lost in the Southern states between 1990 and 2005, the health care sector created 2.4 new jobs.\n\nYes, we are losing jobs in the goods-producing parts of the economy to faraway lands. But we are gaining them in the service sector and net—net—we are creating more jobs than we are losing.\n\nA good friend of mine, Dr. Jonathan Weissler, is chief of medicine and holds the chair in pulmonary research at the University of Texas Southwestern University Hospitals in my hometown of Dallas. We have coffee together in the mornings at our local Starbucks—come to think of it, another globalized service provider.\n\nAfter we have our coffee, Dr. Weissler goes to his office where, like most doctors, he examines patients and then dictates notes into a recorder. The recording is transcribed into the patient's file. There is nothing startling there; this has been standard medical practice for decades. What is new—and what is fast becoming a hallmark of the globalizing economy—is that he no longer pays an on-site employee in Dallas to transcribe his dictation. Instead, Dr. Weissler simply clicks a mouse and sends the recording to a company that farms the transcribing work out to English speakers around the world. While Dr. Weissler sleeps, the notes are typed up overnight in Bangalore for a fraction of the cost and arrive on the good doctor's desktop by morning.\n\nIncidentally, Dr. Weissler says he can tell when the transcripts are produced in India because the English is perfect and even the most complex medical terms are spelled correctly—a testimony to India's teaching of proper English in their schools.\n\nBy reducing costs and streamlining his recordkeeping in this way, Dr. Weissler's practice runs more efficiently and his staff can devote more time to serving patients and growing his practice. The real payoff is that money saved in offshoring transcription can be reinvested into researching new ways to save and improve American lives.\n\nDr. Weissler is harnessing and harvesting globalization. What makes this possible? Cyberspace and globalization. The Net and fiber-optic cable give him the ability to access, coordinate, manage and control resources around the world without regard to distance, borders or time zones.\n\nThere are counterparts to Dr. Weissler in every one of your states. As globalization continues and the world economy evolves, more creative destruction will impact your states. That is the bad news because job destruction creates political pressures for transition programs at best and protectionist or retaliatory responses at worst. The good news is that the creative side of this inexorable phenomenon, properly managed, results in better jobs, higher living standards, lower prices and increased prosperity.\n\nI echo Bill Poole's message: The answer is not protectionism. Rather than labor fruitlessly to protect your constituents from foreign competition, you and your legislatures must prepare them for it. Use your extraordinary talents as leaders to provide the transition mechanisms that will enable them to retool and move up the value-added ladder into higher-paying jobs.\n\nThere is no great secret about how to lay the groundwork for Southern states' success in harvesting and harnessing—in mastering—globalization. The key to adapting to and profiting from globalization lies in education. Texas boomed on the discovery of oil. Now we thrive on the output of the human mind. If you look around Dallas and Houston, you see office buildings, not oil wells or factories. Those buildings warehouse the capital plant of the modern era: human brains. Brains that research and provide services in medicine, marketing, finance and myriad other services. Oil wells eventually run dry. An educated mind never does.\n\nJust as farming and oil and gas and manufacturing once propelled the development of the Southern states, an educated workforce with high earning potential will propel the future of your states, our great nation and the world. The ultimate source of competitive advantage for Texas is not oil and gas or the chemical industry or this widget or that or even the Dallas Cowboys or the San Antonio Spurs (even if they are the good Lord's favorite teams)—it is our elementary and secondary schools, and the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M in College Station, Rice University in Houston, Southwestern Medical and Southern Methodist University in Dallas, and our law and engineering schools and research centers. Each of you could say that for your states. The development of human capacity through education should be the highest policy priority of any government in the South or anywhere else.\n\nWhen I ran for the Senate, I was told to make every effort to condense complex thoughts and ideas into simple catchall phrases. I obviously wasn't very good at it. And, as politicians yourselves, you know meaningful brevity is not an easy task. Nor one that everyone appreciates. Pundits deride the catchy line as \"bumper sticker\" politics. I am not running for anything, so I'll risk offering a bumper sticker for our times, one delivering this simple message: \"You earn what you learn.\"\n\nAs I said at the outset, the South is a mighty economic machine. To remain powerful and prosperous, we need to move faster and farther up the educational ladder. The Chinese and the Indians and the Vietnamese and Eastern Europeans and Latin Americans are taking possession of the lower rungs of the world economy. There are 3 billion or more fervent wannabe capitalists among them who want to be rich like us. We cannot stop them, nor should we bother trying. But we must stay ahead of them. The key to doing so lies in developing our citizens' brainpower. The human brain is the capital plant of the Knowledge Age. Education is the fuel for that plant. The living standards of your constituents will be determined by what they learn. So my best advice for you as governors is to throw your weight and your budget dollars behind education. It is an investment that provides unlimited returns. It is an investment that will secure our economic future.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "June 13, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nI love speaking to Rotarians, especially the Downtown Rotary. I was a member of this wonderful club before I went off to serve in Washington in 1997. I loved every minute of it, especially the patriotism and the esprit de corps. I have always considered Rotarians the Marine Corps of the civic community. Remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines? “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.”\n\nNeither do Rotarians. You have taken Paul Harris' vision and expanded upon and realized it, making every community in America better for it.\n\nI also love the Rotarian sense of humor. When I was a member, Carol Reed used to read the “news” to us at the beginning of every meeting here at Downtown Rotary. One of my all-time favorites was about a man who had fallen into a river in Egypt and had managed to fight off an attack by a crocodile. The punch line, of course, was that if you didn't believe a man could fend off a croc with his bare hands, then you yourself were in “de-Nile.”\n\nToday, I want to talk about another kind of denial. I am not going to talk about the economy or monetary policy or interest rates. We can do that in the question-and-answer period after this sermon, if you wish. What I want to talk about is higher education. I want to focus on the tendency of Dallas to deny that we are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to producing the academic and intellectual excellence needed to make Dallas the great city we all want it to be.\n\nI have deliberately picked the Downtown Rotary Club to convey this message. Rotarians have a long history of commitment to educational excellence, which has benefited countless communities in the U.S. and around the world. And, incidentally, it directly benefited the Federal Reserve. Paul Volcker, the Zeus of central banking gods, the man who pulled this country back from the brink of economic catastrophe, studied at the London School of Economics as a Rotary Scholar. I always speak for myself and for no other official of the Federal Reserve System. Today is no exception. But I think I am safe in saying the entire Federal Reserve holds Rotary in the highest regard. We thank you for what you care about and what you do.\n\nI know that you care about education. I know that you do so much for Dallas. So let me get to the point.\n\nDallas–Fort Worth is the eighth-most-populous metropolitan area in the country and the fifth-most economically productive. Texas ranks second in the nation in population and productivity, surpassed on both fronts only by California.\n\nTexas has six public university systems. The University of Texas System is the granddaddy of them all, with 190,000 students in nine universities and six health institutions. The Texas A&M System has nine universities with 103,000 students and a multicampus health science center. The remaining students are spread over the campuses of the Texas State University System, the University of North Texas System, the University of Houston System and the Texas Tech System. Stephen F. Austin, Midwestern State, Texas Southern and Texas Woman's are each independent public universities. All told, we have about 520,000 students attending the more than 40 public universities in our state.\n\nBy contrast, California has more than 600,000 students enrolled at just 33 public universities. The granddaddy of that state educational system is the University of California, with 209,000 students spread over 10 universities.\n\nHow many people in this room think that Berkeley is the only center of excellence in the University of California System? Not a one of you. And that is because you know that in addition to Berkeley, the University of California System has UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara.\n\nNow here is a fact. According to the latest U.S. News & World Report survey, Berkeley, UCLA, UC San Diego and UC Irvine all outranked UT Austin for overall educational excellence. UC Davis and UC Santa Barbara were tied with UT—at 47th. And the rest of our universities? Texas A&M was ranked 60th. SMU ranked 70th, Baylor 81st and TCU 105th. Rice was ranked 17th, right up there with Johns Hopkins and Vanderbilt and above Berkeley.\n\nHold that thought: The “overtaxed, over-regulated, left-coast state” of California has within one fleet six universities that are ranked equal to or better than UT Austin, our flagship.\n\nNow let's broaden our aperture a little by looking at membership in the Association of American Universities, which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 60 U.S. and two Canadian universities. These 60 U.S. schools garner about 60 percent of all federal R&D dollars; they are home to 82 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1999, three quarters—74 percent—of all Nobel Prizes were won by individuals who were faculty members at AAU universities. It is fair to say that everyone in this room would like to have our Texas universities included in this prestigious group of 60.\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members: UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Caltech, Stanford and USC. Four of those are in the greater Los Angeles area alone.\n\nNew York has seven: Columbia, Cornell, New York University, Syracuse, Stony Brook University, the University of Rochester and the University of Buffalo. You actually should add an eighth by including Rutgers, which is within arm's reach of New York City.\n\nAnd Texas? We have three: Rice, UT Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nThink about that. The great state of Texas—the state I love to brag and boast about; a state of 24 million people that has a glorious history second to none—has the same number of AAU member universities as the city of Boston. And Dallas, my hometown, has none. Zip. Zero. Nada. Dallas, the eighth-largest metropolitan area in America, doesn't have a single top-ranked academic institution. We do have UT Southwestern, a top-tier medical school, of course. But a medical school standing alone, no matter how good, is not enough in a world that is built on advanced technology and in-depth knowledge across many fields.\n\nHow can we expect to navigate our way into the economic future without a single elite university in our city? How can we expect Dallas to prosper in the Knowledge Age—the era in which economic prosperity and wealth will be defined by cyberspace, nanotechnology, robotics and biology, and mathematics-driven financial expertise—without at least one established fountainhead of advanced knowledge?\n\nOn Sunday, Tom Friedman of The New York Times reported an interesting observation by Lucien Bronicki. An expert in geothermal energy in the Negev Desert, Bronicki met with Friedman at an Israeli university. Pointing to a roomful of students studying biomedical engineering, software development, electrical engineering and computing, Bronicki remarked: “These are our oil wells.” And Friedman added: “These are oil wells that don't run dry.”\n\nEconomists may quibble about widgets and whatnot, but they are united on this: Education pays off. There's an irrefutable positive link between education and income. We see it across countries, between individuals, in America's progress over time and when comparing states. Little old Massachusetts, for example, with a third-place ranking in college graduates per capita, has lifted itself up to first in per capita income. California's 11th-place ranking in education gets it 10th in per capita income. Texas ranks 29th in college graduates and 29th in per capita income, well below the national leaders in college-educated workers and earnings. Our neighbor, Arkansas, ranks 49th in both.\n\nMississippi is 50th in income, competing with West Virginia, which is 50th in education. Imagine that: We are closer to Arkansas in educational attainment and income than we are to Massachusetts. I've got nothing against Razorbacks, Ole Miss or the Mountaineers, but that is not where I want Texas to be.\n\nWhen we leave this luncheon today, I want you to look around Dallas' cityscape. Tell me how many factories you see. You won't see any—at least not any of the old-fashioned kind with smokestacks and loading docks and noisy machines. Instead, you will see glass and steel buildings that house the machines and the capital stock of the modern economy: human brains. The brain is to the Knowledge Age what the motor was to the Industrial Age. And education is the oil, the fuel that drives the knowledge economy forward.\n\nLately, we have been cooing and aahing over the Barnett Shale. We brag about the drilling rigs that are popping up all around D/FW Airport. All that is great. We need all the homegrown gas production we can get. But when was the last time the public attention given one rig was lavished on a student like J. Bradford Cutrell, the summa cum laude graduate in microbiology from UT who graduated No. 1 in his class at UT Southwestern last week, winning the top academic prize for having “a superlative medical mind”? Cutrell is an oil well. A homegrown one from Sulphur Springs, Texas. One that will never run dry.\n\nWe need more of him. We need thousands upon thousands of Cutrells here in Dallas. We can fuel our economy with graduates from California and Massachusetts and other states and other countries—up to a point. But that is no substitute for Texas- and Dallas-bred intellectual talent, with its roots in the community and its commitment to building Big D.\n\nWe never know enough in today's world and must embrace lifetime learning to achieve the American Dream. More and more, you earn what you learn. The U.S. economy today is far different than the one that employed our parents and grandparents in the fields and factories. Agriculture represents 2 percent of our national economy. Manufacturing employs only 11 percent of our workforce. Eighty-two percent of American workers are employed in services, a sprawling sector that includes some of the nation's most prestigious and highest-paying jobs. In Texas, average hourly wages in 2005 were $77.23 for internal medicine doctors, $44.81 for geological engineers, $39.53 for computer software engineers and $26.35 for registered nurses, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates. Those are handsome earnings statistics. We want as many of our people as possible working in those income brackets.\n\nChina, the former USSR nations and India together have roughly the same number of college grads age 25-plus as the U.S. does—about 54.1 million. There's no way to stay ahead of the pack without constantly pushing to educate our citizens and also grabbing foreign graduates whenever we can. But we do the opposite. We bring them over here, teach them everything we know—often with U.S.-financed scholarships and always at schools endowed with private U.S. monies and taxpayer funds—then send them back home by denying them citizenship! That has to be the most ridiculous investment paradigm ever, anywhere. We are in essence financing their capital plant and denying ourselves a return on our investment. It is as though we are spending a million dollars to drill a well in the Barnett Shale and then giving away the gas we find.\n\nQuestion: How do we compete with the masses of Chinese and Indians and Eastern Europeans and Vietnamese and Mexicans and Latin Americans who can grow and make stuff so much cheaper than we can? How do we stay ahead of them as they begin to move up the value-added ladder into the service sector, into technology, into programming and into software and the sciences?\n\nNon-answer: by closing up our ports and protecting our economy. We know from the 1930s what that does. Protectionism is a political prescription for economic ruin.\n\nAnswer: We stay ahead of our competitors. We move even faster up the value-added ladder. How? By using our brains—that area my father used to describe simply as “the little one-quart jar between your ears.” Our brains are our capital equipment. The brain is to the Knowledge Age what oil and electricity and mass production were to the Manufacturing Age. We need to nurture and grow more Brad Cutrells. We need to attract and retain every foreign brain we can. We need to provide them with academic homes they will want to come to and then stay around and add value to. We need to house them right here in River City—right here in Dallas.\n\nIf any of you leave this room today willing to accept the fact that Dallas, Texas, does not have one university ranked in the top 60 by either U.S. News & World Report or the Association of American Universities, then you are not the Rotarians whom I know and love. If any of you are willing to accept that David Daniel at the University of Texas at Dallas or Gerald Turner at Southern Methodist University or Kern Wildenthal at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center or Victor Boschini at Texas Christian University or Jim Spaniolo at the University of Texas at Arlington is fighting with one hand tied behind his back because the powers that be in Texas cannot rise above parochialism and give to this city what California has in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, or Los Angeles or San Diego or Santa Barbara, or what New York has in Manhattan, Rochester or Buffalo, then, well, you, my friends, are in a serious state of denial.\n\nAnd if you of all people, you as Rotarians, the Marines of civic life, cannot figure out a way for this city to win on the battlefield of higher education, then woe is the future of our beloved Dallas.",

        "content": "June 2, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nBefore I begin, I want all the candidates for degrees to do me a favor. Stand up, please. Now turn around. Look at all these people, over 2,000 of them. These are your parents, your spouses, your children, your lovers and friends, teachers and relatives. They have been at your side through joyful moments and less than joyful ones. They have encouraged you and badgered you as you approached and surmounted one hurdle after another in your remarkable lives. They have believed in you. And now they are here to celebrate with you the glorious commencement of your lifetime commitment to practicing and researching and advancing the most honorable of professions: the application of medical science to curing the sick, saving lives and solving the many unsolved mysteries of the body and mind.\n\nApplaud your admirers as they applaud you. Thank them for their love and support.\n\nNow, doctors to be, doctorates to be and medical scientist candidates, be seated.\n\nThe only thing that now stands between you and your degrees is … me. Before you walk across this stage and receive your well-earned diplomas and go on to celebrate, you have to listen to me speak, you poor souls. I promise to deliver a message that adheres to the underlying premise of both our professions: I will do no harm.\n\nI was admitted into the “society of educated men and women” at Harvard 36 years ago, when I became the first university graduate in the history of my family. Thirty-six years ago!\n\nMuch has changed since then, but one thing hasn’t. And that is the value of a great education and the celebration of its accomplishment.\n\nHow does a graduation speaker commemorate an event such as this? It is no easy thing.\n\nFor starters, there is the daunting task of appealing to such a broad diversity of backgrounds in these graduating classes. Which brings to mind the film made by the intrepid band of renegades in the graduating class of M.D.’s, which I happened to see Wednesday night at Northpark. Yes, I snuck into the screening of Medecins Sans Decence. I was especially intrigued by the bumper sticker and T-shirt logo. May I respectfully suggest that it be rewritten to read: “I (heart) va … riety.”\n\n…Which, by the way, your class represents more than adequately: You come from 22 states and from nine countries—Canada, China, Egypt, India, Japan, South Korea, Turkey, Taiwan and …Texas. You have your undergraduate degrees from 84 colleges and universities around the world.\n\nHow does one prepare a commencement address for such an assortment of degree candidates who share a common dedication but come from such diverse backgrounds?\n\nWell, the standard routine is to dig through Bartlett’s or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations to find something said by some sage that puts the nobility of the profession you are about to enter in a glorious light. You might remember the definition of a good essay from your undergraduate days: It is a collection of other people’s thoughts disguised to look like your own.[1] Commencement speeches are no different.\n\nHoping to find something profound that I might pinch and adapt for your amusement, I wandered through abridged versions of the great sayings about doctors and medicine by the great minds of the ages—Socrates, Cicero, Mencius, St. Augustine, Voltaire, Martin Luther, Albert Schweitzer … Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton. Alas, I found nothing that was both inspiring and repeatable in mixed company.\n\nActually, I exaggerate. I found one. In the immortal words of the philosopher king Woody Allen,  “The greatest words in the English language are not ‘I love you.’ They are hearing your doctor say, ‘It is benign.’” By the authority vested in the diploma you are about to receive, your words and actions will carry enormous weight in society. Hold that thought.\n\nThe next thing a graduation speaker tries to do is offer a memorable maxim—a homily or platitude with which to send the graduating class off into a brave new world.\n\nGraduations are veritable festivals of maxims. Every commencement speaker dispenses them: Be disciplined; be prepared; be loyal, be thrifty, be brave; don’t waste your talents; to thine own self be true; question authority; take risks; push the envelope; a little rebellion every now and then is a good thing; respect your fellow man; serve others; never compromise your integrity; be true to yourself and your country; never promise more than you can deliver; never forsake your professional obligation; never forget that you have been given talent to do good; never, never, never, never give up the pursuit of excellence.\n\nThese are all good words. But, truth be told, it would save time and expedite many a commencement if the presidents of colleges or deans of schools would forgo the speaker and simply remind the graduates to read or listen to the books-on-tape versions of the Bible or the Koran or Shakespeare or Confucius, the ultimate sources of almost every graduation speech I have ever read or listened to. After all, for this ceremony tonight, it would be hard to improve upon the first line of the Analects of Confucius: “Is there no greater pleasure than to study and, in time, to practice what is studied?”[2]\n\nHow can you improve upon that for a group of scholars that has labored so diligently all these years in the study of medicine and medical science? After you receive your degree on this stage tonight, you will go on to practice what you have studied for so many arduous years. Surely, there is no greater pleasure: What you have learned here will now apply for real, forever.\n\nConsider yourself lucky because not all of us get to practice our studies. At Oxford, I read Latin American history as a graduate student. I wrote countless essays on Joaquín Balaguer, the most prolific writer in the Dominican Republic. Essays with titles like “Joaquín Balaguer: Nemesis or Patron Saint of Naboth’s Vineyard?” You can bet I have spent countless hours kicking that one around with Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke.\n\nBut you are embarking on career paths that will enable you to convert your rigorous education at UT Southwestern into practice. Into noble practice. A practical application of education that serves mankind. So with what maxim might I contrive to send you forth into a world you will shape? How could I improve upon the wisdom of the ages? Not easily. I dug deep into my memory banks and called upon a source more erudite than Shakespeare and more insightful than even Confucius—my mother.\n\nMy mother was a stoic Norwegian. She was raised in an outpost in South Africa, lost her father to the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 and grew up without the benefit of the kind of education you and I have been so blessed to receive. Yet, she was a wise woman. She dispensed exquisite pearls of wisdom to her children, a kind of female Nordic Yogi Berra. One is especially germane to this evening: “Never let your brains go to your head,” she said. The pun is horrific, but the message is profound: To achieve success you will need to keep your considerable talents in perspective.\n\nOscar Wilde said, “The public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgives everything except genius.” Being possessed of genius, much is expected of you. Once you accept the diploma you are about to receive, you will be a doctor—a doctor of medicine, a doctor of philosophy, an authority in medical science. You will have special obligations. Your patients and your collaborators will rely on everything you do and say. People will put into your hands their most precious possessions—their lives, their children’s lives, the lives of their parents, their colleagues and their employees. Enormous faith will be vested in your genius. Science will look to you to solve riddles heretofore unsolved. Even economists will look to you to find ways to escape the Sword of Damocles that shortsighted politicians have placed above our collective heads in the form of Medicare and other entitlement schemes, constructed without thought to their corrosive ultimate cost.\n\nYou will be looked to for answers. Your answers will be considered thoughtful and wise. “The greatest words are hearing your doctor say, ‘It is benign.’” Or, if it is not benign, “We can cure this.” Or, “We can ease your pain.” Or, “We have found a cure,” perhaps for AIDS or tuberculosis or Alzheimer’s or cancer or avian flu. You have the power to cure, to heal, to save. Use it wisely.\n\nUsing it wisely requires recognizing that having brains and years of superior training is necessary but insufficient for success.\n\nTime and time again, in research labs, in clinics, in universities and corporations and government offices—even supranational institutions like the World Bank—we see instances where men and women of towering intellect fail because they have forgotten to develop their emotional quotient with the same devotion they have applied to harnessing and channeling their intellectual quotient. My heartfelt advice to you is to work as hard on expanding your EQ as you have in developing your IQ.\n \nYou have reached the pinnacle of your formal education, the ultimate validation of your IQ (or the penultimate for those of you who go on to join the Academy of Sciences or become Nobel laureates or honored members of one distinguished medical society or another, which I’ll bet most of you will do). You will get there just as fast and enjoy it more if you remember that a sound mind resides most comfortably in a sound, well-rounded person and that a sound, well-rounded person has more than a superior brain. The whole person is as important an achievement for those privileged few who have been admitted to the “society of educated men and women” as is the achievement of intellectual excellence.\n\nWhich brings me to the third and last requirement for a commencement oration—a smattering of Latin. I’ll wrap up with this: “Bubbus, sed possum explicare. Non sed possum comprehendere.”\n\nFor those of you unschooled in the language of the ancient Romans, that is Texan Latin for “Bubba, I can explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.”\n\nThis evening, I have done my best to explain that true success comes to those who best put their talents in context and who connect a substantial intellect to an equally developed emotional capacity. Those of us who lead cerebral lives must constantly strive to elevate our “people skills” to a level equal to our intellectual skills. That’s the bottom line. I can explain it to you. But you must come to understand it on your own.\n\nAnd now, in deference to the iconic economist John Maynard Keynes, who reminded us all that despite the great efforts of devoted doctors and medical scientists, “in the long run, we are all dead,” and mindful that most of you want to get on and party, I say, “Bibamus, moriendum est.” Death is unavoidable. So let’s have a drink! (In moderation, of course.)\n\nI look forward with great pleasure to having a drink with you after you receive your well-deserved degrees and to toasting your achievement and success.",

        "content": "May 24, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nThis conference on inflation measurement has been jointly organized by Mark Wynne and Jim Dolmas of the Dallas Fed and David Altig and Michael Bryan of the Cleveland Fed. For their dedicated effort and superb accomplishment in getting participants and presenters from over 21 countries, I am most grateful.\n\nThe presentations today are devoted mainly to the question of core inflation measurement, while the presentations tomorrow will look at various approaches to the measurement of expected inflation.\n\nDuring the next two days, we will hear presentations by leading students of the subject—academics and economists from the Federal Reserve System and participants and presenters from a number of other central banks, including the European Central Bank, Bank for International Settlements, Bank of Italy, National Bank of Belgium, Reserve Bank of Australia and National Bank of Poland. Governor Mishkin will be the keynote speaker at tonight’s dinner.\n\nThe discussants, who play an equally important role in determining the success of a conference like this, have been drawn from the Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco Feds, as well as from the Bank of Canada, IMF, Bank of Mexico, Bank of Sweden, Brandeis University, the University of Illinois and London Business School. We also have people attending from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Bank of Iceland, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank, National Bank of Romania, Bank of Korea and the Central Bank of the Netherlands, among others, along with many local area academics.\n\nAll in all, we have a very diverse group participating in this conference. For those of you who have come from afar, we welcome you. Texas is a very friendly place. We are honored that you are here, and we hope you will enjoy our hospitality.\n\nThe first paper this morning will be presented by Diana Weymark of Vanderbilt University. The paper looks at ways of constructing operational measures of inflation pressure and specifically proposes three new indexes for measuring such pressure, the extent to which such pressure is alleviated and the effectiveness of monetary policy in reducing expected inflation. One of the interesting findings of the paper is that the proposed indexes show the extent to which the Fed under Chairman Greenspan consistently resisted inflationary pressures and capitalized on deflationary pressures to bring inflation down whenever the opportunity arose.\n\nProfessor Weymark’s paper will be followed by a paper by Julie Smith of Lafayette College. Professor Smith is one of the few academic experts who continue to think about ways of coming up with better measures of core inflation, and indeed, that is the title of her presentation. In her view, core inflation should be defined as the measure of inflation that best predicts future inflation. The central idea in her paper is that core inflation should be measured by adding up the components of the PCE deflator, but weighting them according to how they behave over time.\n\nOne of our main criticisms here at the Dallas Fed of much of the core inflation literature is that it lacks theoretical coherence. It reminds me of the time-honored saying that an economist is someone who sees something work in practice and then wonders if it can work in theory. Today’s third paper, presented by Stefano Siviero of the Bank of Italy, tries to address this issue by proposing a measure of core inflation that weights individual prices on the basis of their usefulness in helping the central bank achieve its goal of price stability. One of the interesting findings of the paper is that a central bank that responds to the traditional “ex-food and energy” measure of core inflation does no better than one that responds to headline inflation. This raises important questions about the utility of the core measure in policy deliberations.\n\nMeasuring core inflation can get quite technical, and the fourth paper for today, presented by Richard Anderson of the St. Louis Fed, is an excellent example in this regard. I won’t try to summarize it for you unless you have a strong desire to learn about “wavelets” from someone whose closest encounter with them was while surfing as a teenager. The central idea in the paper goes way back to the great 19th century Irish economist Francis Edgeworth, who proposed that when calculating overall inflation, individual prices should be weighted not by their share in aggregate expenditure but rather by their volatility, with more volatile prices getting a smaller weight in the overall index.\n\nThe trimmed mean approach to core measurement, which is the way the Dallas Fed prefers to evaluate inflation, is analyzed at some length in the two papers that follow. One, by a pioneer in this line of research, Mike Bryan of the Cleveland Fed, argues that the trimmed mean approach is particularly good at detecting shifts in trend inflation in low-inflation environments. The other, by Anthony Richards of the Reserve Bank of Australia, provides additional evidence on the superior performance of trimmed mean measures using data for the U.S., euro area, Japan and Australia. One innovation in this paper is to break up the owners’ equivalent rent (OER) component of the U.S. CPI along regional lines to further improve the performance of the trimmed mean.\n\nBut lest you think that that settles the debate in favor of the trimmed mean approach, the last paper today, by New York Fed economists Robert Rich and Charles Steindel, casts doubt on the usefulness of any core measure. Their point is that the superior performance of various measures is very sensitive to the sample period being looked at; some measures do well in some periods and some do well in others, leaving little basis for trusting in one measure at all times.\n\nTomorrow, the conference will look at various approaches to the measurement of inflation expectations. The first two papers, to be presented by Stefania D’Amico of the Board of Governors and Oreste Tristani of the ECB, look at how we can use the prices of financial instruments to make inferences about inflation expectations. Dr. D’Amico and her fellow coauthors at the Board of Governors find that the TIPS break-even rate is a useful proxy for inflation expectations in the U.S., despite the fact that the yield on TIPS is known to contain a significant liquidity premium. Dr. Tristani and his coauthor from the Bank of International Settlements are concerned with the interpretation of term premia in the euro area and find that these premia seem to reflect primarily real rather than inflation risks.\n\nAn alternative approach to measuring inflation expectations is to simply go out and ask people what they think inflation is going to be over the next year or two or 10. Our very own Mark Wynne spent a good deal of time working at the European Central Bank on the European Monetary Union. One of his enduring contributions to the EMU was to design the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, which is now featured every three months in the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin. Two papers on Friday, one presented by economist Juan Angel García of the ECB and another by Aidan Meyler, also of the ECB, will look at the usefulness and track record of this survey and the similar one that is run by the Philadelphia Fed. Well-designed surveys of forecasters can shed light on inflation risks, a topic of perennial interest to central bankers.\n\nOf course, it is not just the expectations of professional forecasters that should be of interest to central bankers. The inflation expectations of firms and households matter as well. The penultimate paper of the conference, by three economists from the Polish central bank and presented tomorrow by author Ryszard Kokoszcynski, will look at the performance of measures of household inflation expectations in a group of central European countries. One of the problems with the European Commission’s survey of household inflation expectations is that it elicits qualitative rather than quantitative information, and these responses then need to be further “massaged” before they can be used in assessing the inflation outlook.\n\nIn addition to asking households about inflation expectations, the European Commission survey also asks about inflation perceptions. Normally the perceived rates of inflation in the EU and the rates measured by statisticians track each other quite well. But at the time of the euro cash changeover, there was a huge discrepancy between what the statisticians were measuring and what households said they were experiencing, raising questions about the credibility of the official inflation measures. The final paper of the conference, presented by Marianne Collin of the National Bank of Belgium, looks at what happened and concludes that there was simply a structural break in the relationship between measured and perceived inflation at the time of the cash changeover.\n\nThat is the menu for this feast of thought. I hope you enjoy the discussions and that all of us who are privileged to partake in this conference will leave with renewed vigor and determination to better understand inflation and use that understanding to inform those of us who have responsibility for making monetary policy.",

        "content": "May 14, 2007 Washington, D.C.\n\nPeter Ustinov, the great actor, used to chide the British foreign service by saying he was “convinced there is a small room in the attic of the Foreign Office where future diplomats are taught to stammer.” We do not stammer at the Fed, but we have been known to mumble on occasion. In most central banks, there has traditionally been a premium paid for being opaque.\n\nAlas, obscurity is not our privilege in the reality show that is today’s financial world.\n\nThe conduct of monetary policy is inherently a forward-looking exercise: The Fed sets policy with the goal of holding future inflation at a reasonable minimum while helping economic activity and employment grow at maximum sustainable rates. To do so, the Fed must consider both current and expected inflation and growth. A certain degree of transparency and clarity helps increasingly sophisticated business and financial market operators manage risk. Mindful that our actions and deeds condition the expectations of risk takers, it makes sense for central bankers to provide context for our decisions.\n\nThis evening, I would like to give you a little perspective from my perch at the Dallas Fed. I would like to talk, hopefully with nary a mumble nor stammer, about the service sector and what I consider the consequences of having services, rather than manufacturing, as the driving force of our economy. These views are my own and, I hasten to add, do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFirst, let me give you some facts to set the stage. America’s economy is a behemoth. In 2005, the Dallas district of the Federal Reserve System—all of Texas, 26 parishes in Louisiana and 18 counties in New Mexico—produced 25 percent more output than India in dollar terms. The Twelfth District, headquartered in San Francisco and overseen by my colleague Janet Yellen, produced more output than all of China. The 140 million workers in the United States produce over $13.2 trillion in economic output; 82 percent of those 140 million workers are employed in the service sector, producing 70 percent of our GDP.\n\nOver the decades, the inexorable forces of capitalist evolution have shifted our economic base from agriculture to manufacturing and now to services. The iconic economist Joseph Schumpeter wrote that “stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms.” The transformation of the American economic landscape over time is testimony to our ability to harness our innovative, educated and entrepreneurial culture to master—rather than be victimized by—the instability that is inherent in capitalism. Since the first risk takers arrived on the shores of Virginia and at Plymouth Rock, it has been in our DNA to climb up the value-added ladder. A little history:\n\nLet me put these numbers in perspective for you by contrasting them with China. Today, about 44 percent of China’s working population is still in agriculture, compared with America’s 2 percent. Employment in the Chinese industrial sector is 23 percent, compared with our 16 percent. China’s service sector employs a little bit more than 30 percent of China’s laborers, compared with our 82 percent. In other words, China’s labor distribution between agriculture, industry and services is about the same as ours was in 1900.\n\nSince the demise of Mao, the Chinese have made great strides in improving their education system. They are producing graduates in prodigious quantities. And yet they are a long way from having the quality educational system needed to produce trained workers capable of rivaling ours. Around 15 percent of China’s population aged 25–65 has a high school degree, compared with 85 percent in the United States. One of every 20 Chinese in that age group has a college degree, compared with one in three in the U.S. In China, 700 people out of every million are R&D researchers. Here, that number is at least 6.5 times higher.\n\nAnd in terms of wealth, it is interesting to note that China’s real GDP per capita is roughly 1/25th the size of ours, about the same level as what the U.S. achieved over a century ago.\n\nOur per capita wealth has grown as we’ve moved up the value-added ladder. Generally speaking, our highest paying jobs are in services—engineers, scientists, computer systems analysts, stock brokers, professors, doctors, lawyers, dentists, CPAs, entertainers and other service providers, to say nothing of the mega-compensation paid to hedge fund managers and financial engineers.\n\nBeginning in 1993, the average wage for private services employees surpassed base industry wages. By 1999, all nonretail services employees, even public service employees like government workers and teachers, were averaging more pay per hour than industrial workers.\n\nThe destructive side of the process of capitalism’s “creative destruction” is evident in the numbers as old professions give way to new, higher-paying ones. The number of U.S. farm laborers decreased 20 percent between 1992 and 2002. In the same 10-year time frame, employment of telephone operators decreased 45 percent. That of sewing machine operators decreased 50 percent between 1992 and 2002. This is not ancient history; this all occurred within a time frame that is fresh in the memory of everyone in this room.\n\nYet within that same time frame—between 1992 and 2002—the number of architects grew 44 percent, legal assistants 66 percent and financial services employees 78 percent. In fact, Internet-related job categories didn't even exist until the early 1990s. The creative side of creative destruction has replaced lost jobs in declining sectors with new ones in emerging sectors.\n\nSince 1992, the goods-producing sector has seen its share of nonfarm payrolls fall by 3.9 percentage points. However, the losses have been more than offset by job gains in just three service sectors—professional and business services, health care, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, manufacturing employs one of 10 U.S. workers, about the same number as the leisure and hospitality sector. One in 20 works in construction—fewer than in financial services. Nearly the same number of people work in government as in the goods-producing sector as a whole. In the past year, the number of manufacturing jobs shrank by 1 percent. In contrast, employment grew by around 3 percent in education, health care, and leisure and hospitality and by over 5 percent in professional services.\n\nHere is a statistic that about beats all: At the end of 2005, the U.S. auto and auto parts manufacturing industry employed about 1.1 million workers and added 0.8 percent of the value to our GDP. The legal services sector employed nearly the same number, but contributed 1.5 percent of the value added to GDP. I will resist the temptation to make a lawyer joke because this is no laughing matter to economists: The legal services industry provides as many jobs as auto manufacturers but contributes nearly twice the value-added to our economic output.\n\nI think you get the point: The service sector, not autos and other forms of traditional manufacturing, drives our economy. And will continue doing so.\n\nLooking forward, the Department of Commerce projects that the fastest growing jobs between now and 2014 will be among general managers, health care workers, postsecondary teachers, retail salespeople, customer service reps and other service providers. In contrast, among the jobs with the greatest projected decline will be textile plant workers, machine operators, farmers and ranchers, meter readers, computer and telephone operators, typists, couriers and, to the relief of all families who like to sit down to supper undisturbed, telemarketers and door-to-door salespeople.\n\nThe shift of jobs away from the goods and lower-value-added service sectors to higher-end services is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, it is part of a longer term trend of employment moving to sectors that produce for an increasingly wealthy country, meet the health care needs of our aging population, and provide U.S. employers with the highly trained and flexible workers they need in a broader, more accessible global economy brimming with unskilled labor.\n\nAs people get richer, they shift their spending toward relatively more services. Evidence can be found in the buying patterns of U.S. households, in the historical timeline of the U.S. economy and in nations around the world. For every dollar Americans spend on goods, we spend $1.70 on services—roughly a 60 percent mix in favor of services. In contrast, China spends 58 percent of its consumption on goods versus 42 percent on services. In even poorer India, services represent just 37 percent of spending—the reverse image of the U.S.\n\nIn 1979, I was a young member of the U.S. delegation President Carter sent to China to settle the claims left after Mao’s government seized the railroad rolling stock we had lent Chiang Kai-shek. President Nixon had normalized political relations in the early 1970s, but it fell to President Carter to normalize economic relations and finally raise the flag at the U.S. Embassy.\n\nSo that we could begin to trade with each other and get on with a normal relationship, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal was dispatched to negotiate with Deng Xiaoping. I was Blumenthal’s assistant, so I accompanied him to all his meetings with the Chinese leader. I will never forget our first meeting with Deng. He was electrifying. You may remember he was a short fellow—barely 5 feet, if memory serves—but he was a giant of a man with big dreams. In our first meeting, he entered the room and cackled, “Where are these big American capitalists I am supposed to be so afraid of?”\n\nHe then laid out his vision of driving China down “the capitalist road,” a plan he did not proclaim publicly until later. Deng told us then that he would unleash the Chinese genius and focus it on development and modernization. To him, when it came to ideologies, it didn’t “matter whether it is a yellow cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice.”\n\nWe all know the Chinese have caught economic mice in droves. Since 1979, China reports having grown at better than 9.6 percent a year, adding up to a better-than tenfold expansion of the economy to date. China’s factories produced 200 room air conditioners in 1978; today, they claim to make 79 million a year. Back in the dark old days of rigid central planning, the Chinese produced 679,000 tons of plastics; last year, they were up to 25 million tons—37 times as much. In 2003, China turned out 260 billion more square feet of cloth than it did in 1978. Today’s great building boom is occurring in China, where their government reported 38 billion square feet of floor space was under construction in 2005 for all kinds of structures, compared with 5.7 billion square feet in the United States.\n\nAs China grows—and clearly its manufacturing sector is fueling a very fast growth rate—we know its demand for services will increase even faster. This is good news for U.S. services businesses, because we are king of the global services providers, with an impressive array of sophisticated and high-quality products and services available for sale.\n\nThe size and wealth of our market and our tradition of consumer sovereignty have created the largest and most advanced service economy in the world, a fact reflected in our trade balance. We have consistently run a massive trade deficit—we have done so since the ’70s. Few, however, realize that we run a growing surplus in services trade. That surplus topped $70 billion in 2006, trimming down our overall trade deficit by over 8 percent. Perhaps more important, the positive services gap has been getting bigger.\n\nThe U.S. remains a major destination for international travelers, so it should come as no surprise that in the bookkeeping for our external account, travel is the largest private service we export. Lately, however, travel’s prominence in the statistics has been challenged by other higher-value-added services. Over the past decade, exports of travel, transportation and tourism have grown by 2.9 percent per year. By contrast, computer and information services and research and development have been growing at a double-digit pace. Similar stories abound. Our business services of accounting, auditing, management and consulting—along with insurance, finance and training—have increased mightily, thanks to technological advances that have made those services more tradable. With 16 percent of the world population plugged into the Internet and 41 percent using cell phones, many knowledge-based services can today be sold across the oceans through cyberspace at a fraction of traditional shipping costs.\n\nAmerica tends to export things that are high on the value-added ladder and import from lower down. In computer and information services, for example, we export $5.4 billion and import $2.2 billion. Dig deeper into the data and you will find that we largely export the services of systems architects and designers, while we import the services of basic programmers, who are the foot soldiers of the information economy. In services exports, as in manufacturing and agriculture, we are constantly moving up the value-added ladder.\n\nWe export twice as much intellectual property as we import. Our royalty and license fee income has been growing at 8 percent a year since 1992. Our exports of legal services have grown at 7 percent per year, and they now total nearly five times our imports. Exports of industrial engineering services have increased 18 percent per year since 1992, and we are now shipping out 13 times as much as we are receiving.\n\nOur exports of film and TV rentals are 11 times greater than our imports. Of the 15 biggest-budget Hollywood movies made as of 2006, eight of them would have lost money if seen only in the U.S.—a total of $458 million in losses among them. However, when you include overseas sales, not only did all eight of them make money, but as a group they netted nearly $1.1 billion after production costs.\n\nWhen I was deputy U.S. trade representative, the late, great Jack Valenti used to lobby me ferociously to negotiate the opening of foreign markets to U.S.-made films. His argument was as straight as Occam’s razor: Without the globalization of movies, studios would have had to scale back budgets, make smaller sets, use cruder animation, not-so-special effects and not-so-talented actors and actresses, and create otherwise less sophisticated and entertaining movies. Opening other countries’ markets to our movies would mean bigger and better movies for us to enjoy and more jobs created here at home. Jack was spot on. He would not have been the least bit surprised by the blockbuster revenues earned globally by Spiderman 3 over the past 10 days.\n\nHere is the point: Be it in movies or industrial engineering design, in the service arena we are hotter than Scarlett Johansson. In high-value-added services, the United States holds a significant global competitive advantage.\n\nThe ubiquitous iPod tells the tale. Engraved on the back of my iPod are the words: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” As we send our services out into the world, send our designs to Chinese or Vietnamese or Mexican factories—factories we played a role in designing, by the way—or educate foreigners in our universities, or build R&D centers in India or Estonia or Israel, we are planting apple seeds all over the world. As long as those seeds are allowed to germinate and sprout into economic growth, the world will demand more of our value-added services. And as long as we here at home foster good economic conditions—including well-administered monetary policy—that allow our entrepreneurs to continue creating and selling services demanded globally, we will continue to create American jobs and enhance our prosperity.\n\nI mention “well-administered monetary policy” deliberately. Obviously, the women and men who create and build our high-end economy work best when they are undistracted by inflation or other forms of economic turbulence. They can do their job best when we do our job best by administering monetary policy that underwrites sustainable noninflationary growth.\n\nThe shift to a service economy, however, has made the conduct of monetary policy both more difficult and easier. Let me touch on the challenges it poses for monetary policymakers.\n\nThe service sector is hard to measure. Services are intangible. The data for measuring the impact of services are more squishy than the relatively straightforward accounting for output in agriculture and the manufactured goods sector. To assess services, we must rely on surveys and the good judgment of the statisticians who interpret them.\n\nThere are sophisticated techniques for conducting these surveys. Yet when it comes to services, we cannot easily discern differences between quality improvements and inflationary price increases. This is less of an issue with goods, where we can more readily identify quality changes such as improvements in durability or serviceability. For example, improvements in automobiles are measured through the introduction of seatbelts, airbags and crash-worthy bumpers; the increased durability of engine and suspension components; electronic enhancements that improve fuel efficiency; better sound systems; voice-activated navigation systems and so on.\n\nBut in services, quality improvements are less clear. If your barber raises the price of a haircut, is it because you are getting a better haircut, or is it because the shop is passing on its increasing costs, or is there some other factor at play? I’m sure you’ve seen $15 haircuts at a strip-mall barbershop, and you’ve at least heard of hundred-dollar stylings offered by salons along Wisconsin Avenue. Four-hundred-dollar haircuts have been reported—even on the heads of Democrats. Presumably, there is a quality difference between them, but we can’t measure it the way we can with a ’67 Mustang and Ford’s 2007 model, or between the computing power of an old IBM mainframe and a modern Dell laptop.\n\nThis isn’t rocket science—it’s more challenging than that. In rocket science, the objective is defined and the process involves applying established mathematics. The value of services is less quantifiable, less well defined, and requires considerable judgment to distinguish between price changes resulting from inflationary pressures versus differences in quality.\n\nTake what I do for a living as another example. Government agencies that measure employment and economic activity classify central banking under a broad category called “financial services—other.” It is a service. We serve the public by distributing cash and coin, maintaining an efficient payments system, supervising banks and setting monetary policy—what many might consider important functions. If we perform our services well, the economy keeps on humming, creating jobs and building wealth. If we fail, or just mess up every now and then, our missteps send ripples through the economy. Cash does not arrive at banks or checks don’t clear, inflation gains momentum or employment grows at a suboptimal rate. Yet I can’t point to where our success shows up in GDP statistics. Nor can I tell you how much more or less productive I am versus my predecessors or counterparts.\n\nOur inability to fully distinguish between quality improvements and inflation in services means that when we look at growth in nominal GDP, we can’t be entirely sure how much results from the gains in real output and how much is inflation.\n\nThat is one set of issues. And there are others. In accounting for a knowledge-based economy, for example, the very concept of investment should be broader than the traditional focus on equipment and structures. U.S. government statisticians have already expanded the definition of business investment to include software. Arguably, they should be looking at education spending—which is the very foundation of our knowledge economy—in the same way, instead of counting education costs as a consumption expense.\n\nThe point is that in our efforts to assess the speed limit and engine temperature of the economy, we have plenty of gauges on our dashboard that we can use for evaluating the manufacturing sector. Yet we are deprived of similarly reliable gauges for measuring capacity utilization and other dynamics of the service sector. We spend a terrific amount of time analyzing domestic manufacturing reports—think of the media attention given to the Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing index or the Empire State Index or, if you are astute, the Dallas Fed’s manufacturing index for a district—forgive my Texas brag—that produces more manufactured products than the areas covered by either the Philadelphia or New York surveys. Manufacturing data is so refined that I can tell you whether the plastic we make is used for a bag, bottle, pipe, pillow or floor. Yet, as our economy becomes ever more services-oriented, relying on traditional, goods-focused indicators as predictors of economic activity or inflection points in the business cycle becomes more and more suspect. As comparative advantages are redistributed by globalization, the importance of foreign capacity measurements for manufacturing increases. And the need for a services capacity metric here at home becomes imperative. And yet we—and this is a collective “we,” encompassing the economics profession worldwide, not just the Fed—have perfected neither.\n\nHerein lies an opportunity for enterprising analysts to rise to the challenge I’ve just presented and profit from the development of new data that can help alleviate the deficiencies in service-sector metrics. Many—including our co-host this afternoon, the Coalition of Service Industries—draw well-deserved attention to our services sector, measuring its size, growth, scope and composition to drive home the point that the U.S. economy is services driven. While we can slice and dice the data we have, we still don’t have enough of it available to help us monitor trends with the level of detail and timeliness we have for our goods-producing sectors.\n\nI’ll conclude by calling your attention to another aspect of the growing importance of services in the U.S. economy, a subtle, behind-the-scenes contribution that services are making to the decoupling of the overall economy from the manufacturing sector.\n\nAllow me to draw your attention to Arthur Conan Doyle’s mystery, “Silver Blaze.” In that story, a Scotland Yard inspector asks Sherlock Holmes, “Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?” Holmes replies, “To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.” Puzzled, the inspector notes, “The dog did nothing in the night-time.” “That was the curious incident,” Holmes says. The dog did not bark.\n\nA “curious incident” happened in the U.S. economy during the 2001 downturn. Factory output fell by almost as much during that recession as in the 1981 recession 20 years earlier—7 percent in 2001 versus 8 percent in 1981. Yet, GDP declined by less than half a percentage point in the 2001 downturn versus 3 percent in 1981. The mystery is why the aggregate economy was so much less affected in 2001.\n\nUndoubtedly, a significant part of the explanation is the sharply declining and relatively low real interest rates in the latter period, which helped sustain the construction industry. But it is also important to note the very different behavior of the goods component of GDP across the two episodes. In 1981, “total goods sector” output fell by the same amount as factory output. In 2001, it fell by only half the decline seen in manufacturing. To use the Holmes analogy, goods output “barked” loudly in 1981 in response to the collapse of manufacturing. In 2001, goods output merely whimpered.\n\nThis curious incident points to the solution to our mystery: What the Commerce Department calls “goods-sector output” in fact includes a growing retail and distribution services component that is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in factory production. This was the dog that did not bark. The merchandising services component of goods-sector output declined relatively little in 2001 and helped insulate the economy from the manufacturing collapse.\n\nThe service sector may not be as noisy or get as much analytical or political attention as the manufacturing sector, but it has a significant bite in terms of its impact on economic performance. That is the point to which I hope to have drawn your attention today. As we seek to conduct monetary policy, we will have to develop new methods for determining exactly how the service sector's bite affects the business cycle and economic behavior.\n\nEnough said. Thank you for listening. Let’s stop there, and in the best interest of being transparent, I will do my best to mumble and stammer through responses to your questions.",

        "content": "April 26, 2007 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Luther [King]. You are a generous man. Luther chairs the ad hoc Financial Advisory Group that I occasionally convene at the Dallas Fed and is an invaluable advisor. But his and Teresa’s friendship with the Fisher family goes way back: Teresa was the deaconess who guided our daughter Texana through her confirmation at Highland Park Presbyterian Church a long time ago—in fact, in the last century. Our boys know each other and are friends. And from a professional point of view, I have admired—and been jealous of—Luther since I first started up Brown Brothers’ operations in Texas almost 30 years ago. He is a man of punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor and about as decent and forthright a friend as anybody could hope to have. I am honored to be here with you today, Luther.\n\nI used to be one of you. As Luther kindly mentioned, I ran a little investment advisory firm and hedge fund way back in the days when the clients and limited partners made more money than the investment advisors and general partners did. Imagine that!\n\nI had planned to speak today about four conundra: the impact of globalization; the problem with relying on the data that you and I and we all look at to gauge economic performance; how you—and I use the term “you” deliberately, as you will see later in this talk—will deal with the problems of fiscal recklessness that have led us into a cul-de-sac of long-term liabilities of almost unfathomable dimension; and what a former distinguished associate used to refer to as the yield-curve-shape “conundrum.”\n\nUpon reflection, however, I realized that the latter is really not much of a conundrum. Let me explain, employing the caveat that I am speaking today, as I always do, solely in my personal capacity and am in no way speaking on behalf of the Federal Open Market Committee or for anybody else in the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere is an enormous amount of liquidity coursing though the arteries and veins and capillaries of the financial system worldwide. There is only so much of that liquidity that can be placed by responsible fiduciaries in lesser credits since the markets for non-dollar, non-euro, non-pound denominated paper are limited. This is not to say that investors have declined to invest in other markets, as we see clearly in the narrow spreads between the biggest and most established credits and lesser ones.\n\nBesides, the most prominent central banks have been exemplars of good behavior: the rectitude of the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England is, I think, above question. (As, incidentally, has been the behavior of the Aussies, the Canadians, the Mexicans and many others). The Fed and other central banks have gained credibility in keeping inflation low and stable.\n\nBetter inventory policy has helped make real rates more predictable by smoothing out business cycles. Pension funds are—surprise!—actually matching their investments to the maturity schedule of their liabilities. And in a rapidly globalized world, foreign demand for Treasuries has increased both for portfolio diversification needs and the desire of some newly flush central banks to have ample reserves to reduce currency volatility.\n\nDeclines in risk premia are therefore understandable against the background of sustained, robust growth worldwide, the concomitant reduction in volatility of the global macroeconomy and less inflation risk. And the use of derivatives has reduced the short-term price risk of long instruments, including Treasuries. So, where is the conundrum? Why is it so puzzling that longer rates are relatively low?\n\nNow, to be sure, one might try to dispense with the “riddle” of the yield curve by arguing that the reason for having a flat to negatively sloped yield curve is that the market is forecasting the possible onset of recession.\n\nIt is true that inverted yield curves have historically presaged recession, but with one rather interesting exception that old folks like Luther—let me restate that—that the historians among you—will recall. In 1967, we had a credit crunch hit the housing sector particularly hard and we were fighting an unpopular war in a far-off land. The yield curve flattened, then inverted, yet no recession ensued.\n\nThat said, I think that as we progress deeper and deeper into a globalized marketplace with more sophisticated methods for hedging risk, and with central banks working double time, overtime, to exorcise the demon of inflation, there are reasons other than concern for the future of the economy for investors to lower the risk premia they have historically demanded as they move out along the yield curve.\n\nWhich leaves us with the other three conundra.\n\nBy now, many of you know that globalization is a preoccupation of the Dallas Fed. We are building the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute. We orient most of our research and prepare for Federal Open Market Committee meetings by looking at the world through a global lens.\n\nWe surmise that the integration of markets for goods, services and capital has been facilitated by the physical and cyber linkage of the planet. That integration has changed the gearing of the U.S. economy and brought into question many, if not most, of our most treasured economic and monetary conventions.\n\nWe see tremendous behavioral shifts in the real world as middle managers everywhere take advantage of increased global integration by reaching across physical borders and though cyberspace to drive down their costs of goods sold and their G&A costs, tighten their inventory management, improve supply-chain efficiency, enhance productivity and access new markets.\n\nWe note that this goes deeper than the simple trade in goods. And we know that it affects not-for-profit enterprise as readily as for-profit enterprise.\n\nLet me give you a simple example. One of the great lung specialists in the world is Dr. Jonathan Weissler, the chief of medicine at UT Southwestern in Dallas. After he sees a patient, he dictates his notes into a wireless voice recorder. The recording is transmitted electronically to a service that employs English-speaking scribes all over the world, often in India. When Dr. Weissler comes to work the next morning, there on his desktop is a transcript. So while the good doctor gets his 40-winks-sleep overnight, someone in India has written up his notes at a fraction of the cost of having them transcribed locally and—of concern to those worried about the status of education here in the U.S.A.—with greater accuracy. Dr. Weissler’s productivity is enhanced. With the savings that come from utilizing globalization, he can put more time and money into saving lives here at home.\n\nWe see this pattern repeated over and over again, countless times in every size and shape of enterprise. So what is the conundrum here? What riddle does globalization’s impact pose? Well, the riddle, or more appropriately, the question, is whether or not this impacts how the Federal Reserve executes policy in accordance with our dual mandate to foster the monetary conditions necessary to foster noninflationary sustainable employment growth.\n\nHow do we deliver on this mandate in a globalized world? How do we monitor global capacity constraints when statisticians in other countries measure things differently and at different time intervals? What instruments should we use to determine the optimal speed that our economy can grow in a rapidly integrating world? In economists’ terms, what is our NAIRU—our non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment? What is its impact on inflationary expectations? How is globalization conditioning the behavior of workers? Of consumers? Of capital?\n\nNo one really has the answers, although some pretend to. So we are working hard at the Dallas Fed and throughout the Federal Reserve to come up with new data and new models that fit the new world.\n\nWhich brings me to the next conundrum: the phenomenon of “data dependency.” Some time ago, I gave a speech titled “Confessions of a Data Dependent.” This was back when it was in vogue to say that monetary policy was data-dependent. And yet, upon reflection, I have personally come to feel that this is a bit of an oxymoron, a contradiction in terms, like “jumbo shrimp” or “instant analysis.” Why? Because so much of the data you and I consider essential are moving targets, subject to constant revision—perhaps because the new, globalized gearing of the economy makes measurement so difficult. How “data dependent” can we really be?\n\nIn the 1920s, there was a British Inland Revenue agent who later became a director of the Bank of England named Josiah Charles Stamp. Stamp once quoted a friend who had observed, “The Government [is] extremely fond of amassing great quantities of statistics. These are raised to the nth degree, the cube roots are extracted, and the results arranged into elaborate and impressive displays. What must be kept in mind, however, is that in every case, the figures are first put down by a village watchman, and he puts down anything he damn well pleases!”\n\nAmerica’s statisticians are a careful lot who do not record anything they darn well please. But it is important to remember that even our best measures of economic performance are subject to substantial revision well after the fact, not only because the modern equivalent of the village watchman occasionally puts down faulty numbers, but also because we can’t always get numbers from all the watchmen in real time.\n\nThere is a tension between timely data and accurate data. Timely data are often based on estimates and probabilities that are injected to fill in missing numbers, only to be changed when more complete information comes in. Markets react to the timely data with apoplectic frenzy, only to have the same number quietly revised many months or even years later in light of more substantiated evidence, but without the same market fanfare.\n\nLet’s go to the videotape on inflation. In the 1990s, concern grew that our main inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, was providing a distorted view of price trends. A pickup in the pace of productivity growth in some sectors and an expansion of the reach of global markets due to the far-reaching trade-liberalization policies of Presidents George H. W. Bush (“41”) and Bill Clinton were, together, leading to sharp declines in the relative price of goods like apparel and consumer electronics. The CPI reflects the resultant shift in household spending patterns with a substantial lag and, in the meantime, puts too little weight on falling prices and too much weight on rising prices. The more quickly household spending patterns change, the greater the likelihood of upward bias in CPI inflation.\n\nAn alternative inflation gauge—the deflator for personal consumption expenditures—both continuously adjusts for changes in the composition of household spending and also has broader coverage than the CPI. So, in 2000, federal policymakers adopted the PCE price index excluding food and energy as their preferred measure of inflation trends.\n\nUnfortunately, the nice theoretical properties of the PCE inflation measure come at a price: PCE inflation is not released until several weeks after CPI inflation (which confuses the public) and is revised, often substantially, when new, more complete estimates of the composition of household spending become available (which confuses the analytical community).\n\nCore inflation for 2003 was initially reported out at 0.9 percent. Later, having gone back and studied the entrails, the Commerce Department put inflation during 2003 a full half percentage point higher, at 1.4 percent. Similarly, 2004 core inflation was initially thought to be 1.6 percent, but subsequent revisions put it at 2.2 percent.\n\nOr look at GDP estimates. The first release received for GDP growth for the fourth quarter of last year was 3.5 percent. A month later, it was revised downward to 2.2 percent. Recently it was revised upward to 2.5 percent.\n\nRemember this when the numbers for the first quarter of this year are released tomorrow. GDP growth, industrial production, retail sales and payroll employment are imperfect statistics that make a splash when they are first released and yet hardly make a ripple when their true nature is finally revealed.\n\nData revisions have important implications for policymaking and policy evaluation. Potentially, they can erode central bank credibility. Partly because of data revisions, it is hard for us to spot turning points in the economy. The fact is, statistical agencies fill in missing data with extrapolations that are especially likely to be wrong at these turning points because the estimates and probabilities they use are biased toward the latest trend. The result is that we are likely to underestimate slowdowns and pickups at precisely the moment when we need to take corrective action.\n\nInevitably, a monetary policymaker’s reliance on data that are subject to revision means that some decisions would have been marginally different with the benefit of hindsight. I say “marginally different” for two reasons. First, the FOMC is eclectic in that it monitors a broadly diversified portfolio of indicators and reports from a variety of sources in the expectation that the noise elements in the various indicators and reports will tend to cancel one another out. This portfolio approach limits the weight on any one piece of information or any one source. Second, our policy decisions are influenced by what’s happened in the past mostly through how the past conditions the outlook for the future: We’re focused on where inflation and real growth seem to be heading, more so than on where they’ve been.\n\nIn this respect, Fed policymakers are value investors rather than momentum traders. After hard experience, we’ve learned how to deal with revisions and are able to manage them more or less successfully. We don’t radically alter policy based on inflation or output realizations as long as the reasoning behind our original assessment of the economic outlook seems sound. In a sense, we have learned the dangers of taking numbers based on estimates and probabilities at face value alone.\n\nEstimates and probabilities bring me to the last conundrum: How you are going to save your children and grandchildren from facing the certain probability that the massive liabilities accumulating to our Medicare and Social Security programs are going to rob them of their futures.\n\nAccording to the latest official U.S. government trustee reports that were released on Monday of this week, the infinite-horizon discounted present value of our unfunded liability from Social Security and Medicare—in common language, the gap between what we will take in and what we have promised to pay—now stands at $88.2 trillion. The potent combination of lower birthrates, higher medical costs and longer life expectancies provides little reason to hope the figure will fall. Last week, I shared my concerns about our long-term liabilities that were based on earlier trustee reports, which tallied the shortfall at $83.9 trillion, a full $4.3 trillion less that this new report suggests.\n\nJust how big is an $88.2 trillion shortfall? Well, it is almost seven times the U.S. gross domestic product. It is more than 100 times the country’s annual defense budget. If you divide the $88.2 trillion evenly among the 302 million U.S. residents, you get a per-person liability of $292,000—more than six times the average household’s annual income. Each of us would have to pay that sum today if we wanted to guarantee the solvency of our entitlement system for future generations.\n\nLet’s explore this $88.2 trillion in a bit more detail.\n\nWe can divvy this liability into four parts. The largest is the $29.8 trillion needed to fund Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays. Another $27.7 trillion comes from Medicare Part B, which covers doctors’ services. And $17.1 trillion stems from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit that took effect in January of last year. The remaining $13.6 trillion comes from Social Security. What is interesting is the smallest of the four parts is the most debated in Washington. It is yet another example of the old rule that the amount of time spent debating a budget issue in Washington is always inversely proportionate to its cost.\n\nWhen people think about these kinds of issues, they usually assume Social Security is the big problem. As these figures show, the unfunded liability from Medicare Part D alone—the new drug benefit—is greater than the entire Social Security shortfall. Taken together, Medicare’s unfunded liabilities are more than five times Social Security’s.\n\nThe total unfunded liability from Medicare and Social Security encompasses about 7.6 percent of U.S. GDP from here to eternity, which works out to 70 percent of all federal income tax revenues from here to eternity. So instead of paying $292,000 per person now, we could permanently sequester 70 percent of all current and future income tax revenue for use only on Social Security and Medicare. Or we could permanently raise income tax rates by 70 percent to accomplish the same thing—although we’d actually need to jack it up even higher because a large tax hike would probably discourage some people from working.\n\nTo save promised benefits, we would have to dramatically cut spending starting right now or raise income taxes and never bring them back down. And by doing so, we would only be covering the shortfall from Social Security and Medicare payroll tax receipts. All other existing sources of entitlement funding, including payroll tax revenue, copays, deductibles and premiums, would have to remain in place.\n\nThis is not a pretty picture. And as bad as the situation currently is, the necessary response becomes ever more drastic the longer we wait. If past is prologue, the most likely response may be to amend the current system—for example, by raising the retirement age or making the payroll tax more progressive. Many options would improve the fiscal fitness of our entitlement system and reduce the need for drastic action elsewhere in the federal budget. But let’s be honest. These remedies work only because some people would get less than they are currently slated to receive. Painful as that may be, the question is whether other options would be even more difficult.\n\nAt face value, fiscal policy may not seem a concern for the Federal Reserve. After all, Congress holds the power of the purse. But the Fed cannot be an indifferent bystander to the overall thrust of fiscal policy. The reason is straightforward: Bad fiscal policy creates pressure for bad monetary policy. When fiscal policy gets out of whack, monetary authorities face pressure to monetize the debt, a cardinal sin in my mind.\n\nThe Fed is not the answer to our fiscal woes. Congress, as keeper of the government’s purse and the sole body with the power to tax and spend the people’s money, and the president, who approves their spending, are where the buck should stop. But here is the rub: Voters like you elect the Congress and the president. History may place blame on this or that president or on Congress for failing to act. Ultimately, though, the responsibility for solving this looming fiscal issue rests with you, the voter.\n\nYou may remember my mention of Josiah Stamp earlier. If you don’t figure out a way to get your elected representatives to come to grips with the overwhelming problem of Medicare, your heirs may well end up like Josiah Stamp’s. Stamp refused to evacuate his stately home during Hitler’s bombings of London. He and his eldest son, Wilfred, were killed by a bomb in 1941. Well, under prevailing British law, in the event one could not determine who in the line of succession died first, it would be presumed that the eldest did. Thus, legally, Wilfred momentarily inherited his father’s peerage. Despite dying together, the Treasury levied the estate tax twice: once on the occasion of Papa Stamp’s death, then again immediately afterward upon Wilfred Stamp’s death.\n\nIf you don’t get your leaders to focus on solutions that cover the unfunded liability of these entitlement programs, you will be faced with a Hobson’s choice between a Federal Reserve that reneges on its most solemn duty and government tax measures far more drastic than ever occurred to the hapless Stamp family.\n\nThe Fed will not monetize our government’s debts. So you are left with the people you elect to represent you in Washington. In the end, that means you must turn to the person you look at every day in the mirror—you.\n\nThis is not a case where time heals all wounds. Indeed, it is the exact opposite. Time, in the case of our long-term unfunded liabilities, wounds all heels. And you and your children and your children’s children will be the heels who are wounded unless you demand that something be done about it.\n\nWell, Luther, I am not sure that happy ending will put a spring in your step as you retreat to luncheon. Here is the point: Despite the constant changes occurring in the way the world is economically geared and measured, despite the imperfection of the data, and despite the ebb and flow of political tides, the Federal Reserve does its level best to get things right.\n\nWhen I was invited to enter what some call “The Temple” of the Fed, Chairman Greenspan sat me down and told me that I only have one duty here and that is to pursue the truth. It is a great privilege to work for an institution that is so true to its purpose.\n\nAnd Luther, maybe, just maybe, when all is said and done, my colleagues and I will be able to execute our mission with the same accomplishment and grace and humility with which you and Teresa have built your legacy in Fort Worth and in the investment community at large.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "April 19, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\n[\n1\n]\n\nI hope I said that better than when our family arrived in Tokyo in 1990 and my son James promptly spoke his first Japanese words:\n\n,\n\nwhich turned out to mean: “My dog has a very long snout.”\n\nDomo. Thank you, Sylvia. Thank you, Curtis. Thank you all. Thank you for honoring me with the Sun & Star Legacy Award. I am most grateful to the Japan-America Society for this honor. I am especially honored to receive this award in the presence of Kamo-san, a fine representative of the government of Japan. And I am delighted to have witnessed the presentation of the Bridges to Friendship Award to my buddy, Ron Kirk.\n\nRon and I share two things in common. We both took leave of our better senses—or did not listen to our better sensei—and ran for the U.S. Senate. We joined a long line of others, Democrats and Republicans, who learned the meaning of the Latin phrase, Veni, Vidi, Defici: I came, I saw, I lost.\n\nAnd much more important than all that, we both married smart, beautiful women. I am happy to see Ron here tonight. I am even happier to see Matrice, one of the best and brightest and most beautiful women on God’s green Earth. (Nancy is at a meeting in Boston tonight, so I can get away with that one.)\n\nI love Japan.\n\nIn 1990, Nancy and I packed our bags and our four kids and, with the assistance of the Japan Society and the Nomura Research Institute, went off to live in Tokyo to learn more about the Land of the Rising Sun. We tackled it with full-bore enthusiasm, doing our best to be as Japanese—and as non-gaijin—as possible. We traveled everywhere, ate things most Americans wouldn’t want to know about, and drank a lot of sake and good Japanese beer.\n\nWe even worked on a rice farm and a pear farm. The Japanese farmer I worked for felt that bees “were too random,” so he had scores of women—and me—climbing ladders carrying bags of pollen, which we carefully brushed onto each blossom of every pear tree on his farm. It was quintessentially Japanese.\n\nIn preparation for that adventure, I read all the requisite literature then in vogue: Professor Reischauer’s works; books by Robert Whiting, particularly The Chrysanthemum and the Bat; Murasaki Shikibu’s The Tale of Genji—the translated version, of course. I read Karel van Wolferen’s The Enigma of Japanese Power, Robert Christopher’s The Japanese Mind and several Japanese novels, like The Temple of the Golden Pavilion and Tanizaki’s Naomi. My favorite was Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro. Loosely translated, the word kokoro means “the heart of things.”\n\nLet me get to the heart of things; to why I love Japan.\n\nThe story of Japan reaffirms faith in the power of man- and womankind to regenerate, to overcome bad decisions or bad luck or outright defeat. If you know the history of Japan, you can’t help but believe in resurrection. Robert Christopher, whom I just mentioned, arrived in Tokyo just a few days after General MacArthur accepted Japan’s surrender on the decks of the Missouri. Here is what he wrote:\n\nJapan serves as a reminder that cynics and even the most highly regarded pundits and thoughtful prognosticators can be dead wrong when it comes to evaluating the spirit and resilience of mankind. After the war, the Western press assigned Japan to the dustbin of history.\n\nMy friends here know that I am a devotee of The New York Times. I read it every morning without fail—after reading The Dallas Morning News, of course—even though its motto “All the News That’s Fit to Print” occasionally comes closer to “All the News That’s Fit to Tint.” Here is what a Sunday New York Times had to say about the Japanese economy in 1945: “It is not likely to expand sharply….The prospect [is for] a return to Japan’s status as a small, self-contained nation.”\n\nHow myopic they were. Despite the Times’ prognostication, Japan became the second largest and most prosperous economy in the world, eventually impacting every consumer on the planet. Among its many accomplishments that affect our daily lives, Japan makes the finest automobiles the world has ever known (the guys here tonight from Toyota paid me to say that). Its culinary tradition is a favorite of the elites of all American and European capitals. Japan has given mind-boggling technologies to consumers around the world—although those ubiquitous household toilets that only a NASA scientist can operate have yet to make much of a splash on this side of the Pacific.\n\nFrom the rubble, from the “melancholy and horrifying landscape” described by Robert Christopher, a great and important economic machine arose and a great and important culture was resurrected.\n\nFor these and many other reasons, Japan has been a source of constant fascination to me. After that first experience in 1990, I spent a great deal of time there. In 1998, I was assigned by the president of the United States to cochair the U.S.–Japan Enhanced Initiative on Deregulation and Competition Policy, which he and Prime Minister Hashimoto had cooked up and which met countless times and allowed me to deepen my understanding of Japan and the Japanese.\n\nThe one thing that is so engrossing about Japan is that the more you experience it, the less you know about it. Every time I began to think I had it figured out, I’d realize that I was only just beginning to understand it.\n\nLet me share with you a metaphorical incident that puts it all in perspective.\n\nAs Curtis mentioned, in the spring of 1990, our son Anders, then 13, became the second non-Japanese boy in history to play in the Tokyo Senior Boys Baseball League, on a team named the Minato Moose, so that he could learn the meaning of wa, or team spirit.\n\nIn Texas, he was considered a fine ballplayer. But in Tokyo, where junior high and high school boys throw 90-mile-per-hour fastballs like clockwork and the pro teams begin recruiting 13-year-olds, he had to work himself almost to death to make the team.\n\nHe came home one night from tryouts at around 10 o’clock. Having passed what was known as the “thousand grounder test”—an infield drill where you field grounders until either you have caught what seems a thousand of them or your hands bleed or swell up so as to be useless—he had made the team. He had his league patch, his number and two Japanese characters that were to be sewn on his uniform before he went off to play a game at 8 o’clock the next morning in Yokohama. He proudly handed them to us and fell onto his tatami mat, asleep within seconds.\n\nWell, at 10 at night, Nancy and I had no choice but to sew the patches on ourselves. We borrowed a needle from a kindly neighbor, but she didn’t have any thread that matched Anders’ uniform. So I spent the entire night painstakingly pulling thread out of a dress of Nancy’s that was the same color, while she sewed the patch, the numeral and, most importantly, the two characters that stood for Minato Moose on the front of his uniform.\n\nWhen Anders awoke, we proudly presented him with his uniform, gave him his obento box—full, incidentally, of peanut butter sandwiches that Nancy had exquisitely sculpted to resemble the sushi pieces his teammates had in their obento boxes, it being hard for an American boy to eat squid during a baseball game—and sent him off to the team bus headed for his first ballgame as a member of the Minato Moose.\n\nThat night, at the appointed hour, the door to our apartment flung open, Anders walked in, threw his glove down and burst into tears. Before we could say “How did it go, son?” he looked at us in horror and said, “Mom, Dad: You sewed the characters on upside down.”\n\nOver the past 17 years, my family and I have tried hard to develop an understanding of Japan. I admire the country. I love Japanese culture. I have the greatest respect for the Japanese people. Tonight you have made me very proud to be recognized for trying to do so, even if I occasionally get things upside down.\n\nDomo arigato gozaimasu. Thank you so much.",

        "content": "April 16, 2007 Irving, Texas\n\nThank you, Ken [Bentsen]. You and your family have rendered great service to Texas in both chambers of the United States Congress. I held your uncle, Lloyd, in the highest regard, as I do you. And I especially appreciated the support you always gave to us on trade issues when I was deputy U.S. trade representative and you were serving the 25th District in the House of Representatives. You supported fast-track authority, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and many other trade initiatives that were not necessarily the most popular within your party at the time. That took courage.\n\nI am going to speak today—the day before you file your 2006 returns with the IRS—about fiscal policy, an area into which central bankers rarely wander. The idea for this speech came to me when I saw a recent rerun of From Here to Eternity, the film classic based on James Jones’ great novel about Pearl Harbor. It won eight Academy Awards in 1953 and is perhaps best remembered for that steamy scene of Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr frolicking in the surf.\n\nKen, I want to say right up front that I was not thinking of your former employer here. I realize that in citing this great film, some film buff in the audience might remember that Donna Reed won an Oscar for Eternity by playing a “hostess” in an establishment cleverly named the New Congress Club—a reference to a different kind of congress. Instead, I was thinking of the longer-term picture of our nation’s fiscal predicament, something that cannot fail to escape the attention of any Federal Reserve official looking down the field for issues that could prove especially vexing for central bankers charged with keeping inflation at bay.\n\nLet me explain. But first, let me make clear, as I always do, that I speak only for myself today and not for others at the Fed or for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nJust 15 years ago, our country confronted a record peacetime federal budget deficit of $290 billion. People of goodwill from both sides of our political spectrum got together and realized that deficits of this magnitude threatened the U.S. economy’s long-term health. They made tough choices, and through a combination of fiscal prudence and strong economic growth, decades of deficits gave way to a remarkable $239 billion surplus in the year 2000.\n\nIn 2007, we again face a $200 billion deficit. Once again, people of goodwill are pledging to achieve a surplus by 2012. Indeed, the president’s proposed 2008 federal budget envisions a gradual reduction in deficit spending from $244 billion this year to $187 billion in 2009 to $54 billion in 2011. In 2012, the federal budget would return to surplus, albeit a more modest one than was achieved seven years ago.\n\nOf course, every economic forecast is based on assumptions. The good news is the macroeconomic forecasts behind that five-year march toward fiscal balance are actually quite reasonable—3 percent real annual GDP growth between now and 2012, coupled with a 4.8 percent unemployment rate. But the promise of a disappearing deficit rests on another important assumption we should discuss in greater detail—that real spending growth will be held to a 0.4 percent annual rate, which is quite low by historical standards.\n\nIf you reckon that in fiscal matters, past is often prologue, then a good way to determine what will happen in the future is to look to the past.\n\nBefore doing so, let me remind you that the Federal Reserve is a strictly nonpartisan institution; when you enter the temple of the Federal Reserve, you check your partisan affiliation at the door. But you don’t check your sense of humor, which is why a story told widely by George Shultz, the great Republican public servant, comes to mind. When he was director of President Nixon’s Office of Management and Budget, he became worried about the amount of money Congress was proposing to spend. After some nights of tossing and turning, he called legendary staffer Sam Cohen into his office. Cohen had a long memory of budget matters and knew every zig and zag of budget history. “Sam,” Shultz asked, “tell me something just between you and me. Is there any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending money?” Cohen looked at him, furrowed his brow, and after thinking about it, replied, “Mr. Shultz, there is only one difference: Democrats enjoy it more.”\n\nI can’t vouch for anyone’s particular sense of enjoyment, nor should I as a Federal Reserve official. I think it best to stick to an analytical, “just the facts, ma’am” approach.\n\nSo what are the facts? What has the federal spending picture looked like in recent years? As you can see on the slide, real outlays from 2001 to the present have grown at an annual rate of 4.6 percent. By contrast, they grew at a 2 percent to 3 percent rate during the years Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were in office, about 1.5 percent during Bush 41’s tenure and 0.8 percent in the Clinton years. You notice that I refer to the presidents under whom this spending occurred. It is important to remember that it takes two branches of government to tango on budget matters: the executive proposes, and the legislative disposes. Congress has the final say on all budget matters.\n\n\n\nTo some extent, these different growth rates reflect different circumstances. The Clinton years, for example, reaped the benefits of the post-Cold War peace dividend, whereas today’s policymakers have been called upon to wage the war on terror. It is clear that defense spending has been responsible for much of the budget’s deterioration. Real yearly defense outlays have grown by almost 10 percent in the wake of 9/11, reversing the steady decline since the end of the Cold War.\n\nNondefense outlays have also risen rapidly in the wake of 9/11, and for reasons not obviously related to national security. These expenditures have grown at a real annual rate of 3.5 percent over the past six years, the fastest sustained rate of the post-World War II era. I do not mean to suggest that any particular person or policymaker is responsible for this increase, but the fact is, the increase has occurred.\n\nUsing the past as our guide, let’s consider just how bad the deficit picture could become. If we replace the 0.4 percent spending-growth assumption in the proposed budget with the 4.6 percent rate that has thus far prevailed in the 21st century, the $61 billion surplus projected for 2012 turns into a $701 billion deficit. That’s a big number. To be fair, it is probably too big because it assumes that the rapid post-9/11 defense buildup will continue apace. It is perhaps more reasonable to assume that the central tendency of real annual spending growth between now and 2012 will more closely resemble the post-Vietnam War historical average of 2.3 percent. With this assumption, the 2012 deficit would be $231 billion—about as large as the one we face today.\n\nOur national leaders are considering other fiscal reforms that could have a big impact on the deficit picture. Since tomorrow is Tax Day, let’s start with the alternative minimum tax. The AMT is a “backup” income tax code put in place more than a generation ago to ensure every high-income household paid taxes. AMT rates are somewhat lower and flatter than ordinary income tax rates but without many common deductions, such as state and local taxes. We taxpayers must separately compute our liabilities under each tax scheme and pay the higher of the two obligations.\n\nOnly 20,000 people paid AMT in 1970. Less than 40 years later, 3.5 million households have been swept into the AMT net. If no action is taken, an estimated 20 million households will join them this year, and some 15 million more will be added to the ATM rolls by 2012.\n\nWhy the big jump this year? The answer—as is so often the case in the world of central banking—comes down to inflation. AMT brackets don’t rise as price levels change or the economy grows, so over time, bracket creep pushes more and more people onto the AMT. A series of temporary patches has held the inflation component at bay. The relief has now expired, causing that 20 million-household jump.\n\nA consensus seems to have formed around the proposition that we should stop this from happening by extending the patches and permanently indexing the AMT for inflation. Such a change would substantially slow the march of households toward the AMT—but it would be a very expensive proposition. If tax cuts approved in 2001 and 2003 are made permanent, the AMT would cost the Treasury an estimated $945 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nIf the tax cuts aren’t made permanent, AMT reform could be done more cheaply. That $945 billion tab could be reduced to $520 billion because fewer people would have to pay the AMT. Of course, the flip side of that picture is that households would pay more in taxes as other tax cuts on income also expire, using money that might otherwise have been spent on cars, furniture and travel. And, sure enough, a Treasury Department study finds that future economic activity might fall modestly if the tax cuts lapse. As is so often the case in the policy arena, every choice has its costs and its benefits. No easy solution is in sight.\n\nIn some respects, however, talking about near-term fiscal issues like the AMT and the tax cuts misses the bigger problem. These are issues we can likely—or at least conceivably—weather. The longer-term issue of entitlements is the more serious fiscal problem, with more significant potential consequences for the economy.\n\nAccording to official government trustee reports, the infinite-horizon discounted present value of our unfunded liability from Social Security and Medicare—in common language, the gap between what we will take in and what we have promised to pay—now stands at $83.9 trillion. The potent combination of lower birthrates, higher medical costs and longer life expectancies provides little reason to hope that the figure will fall.\n\nJust how big is an $83.9 trillion shortfall? Well, it is six times the U.S. gross domestic product. It is more than 100 times the country’s annual defense budget. And it is about 10,000 times the annual budget of the Environmental Protection Agency. That is a lot of money, even for a central banker.\n\nLet’s explore this $83.9 trillion in a bit more detail (see slide). As you will see, the largest portion of the liability is the $28.1 trillion needed to fund Medicare Part A, which covers hospital stays. Another $26.2 trillion comes from Medicare Part B, which covers doctors’ services. And $16.2 trillion stems from Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit that took effect in January of last year. Finally, $13.4 trillion comes from Social Security, the topic of reform debate among Congress, the president and others in recent years. It is yet another example of the old rule that the amount of time spent debating a budget issue in Washington is always inversely proportionate to its cost.\n\n\n\nWhen people think about these kinds of issues, they usually assume Social Security is the big problem. But, by golly, it isn’t. As these figures show, the unfunded liability from Medicare Part D alone—the drug benefit—is greater than the entire Social Security shortfall. Taken together, Medicare’s unfunded liabilities are more than five times that of Social Security. So while we can applaud policymakers who have tried to shore up Social Security, we must be ever mindful that the lion’s share of the total $83.9 trillion unfunded liability problem will remain even if they succeed.\n\nBut we’re a big country, so let’s look at it on a per-person basis. If you divide the $83.9 trillion evenly among the 300 million U.S. residents, you get a per-person liability of $280,000—more than five times the average household’s annual income. Each of us would have to pay that much today if we wanted to guarantee the solvency of our entitlement system for future generations.\n\nLet me put it yet another way. The total unfunded liability from these programs encompasses about 7.5 percent of U.S. GDP from here to eternity, which works out to 68 percent of all federal income tax revenues from here to eternity. So instead of paying $280,000 per person now, we could permanently sequester 68 percent of all current and future income tax revenue for use only on Social Security and Medicare. Or we could permanently raise income tax rates by 68 percent to accomplish the same thing—although we’d actually need to jack it up even higher because a large tax hike would probably discourage some people from working.\n\nNow that I have your attention, remember that to save promised benefits, we would have to dramatically cut spending starting right now or raise income taxes and never bring them back down. And by doing so, we would only be covering the shortfall from Social Security and Medicare payroll tax receipts. All other existing sources of entitlement funding, including payroll tax revenue, copays, deductibles and premiums, would have to remain in place.\n\nThis is not a pretty picture. And as bad as the situation currently is, the necessary response becomes ever more drastic the longer we wait. If past is prologue, the most likely response may be to adjust the parameters of the current system—for example, by raising the retirement age or making the payroll tax more progressive. Many options would improve the fiscal fitness of our entitlement system and reduce the need for drastic action elsewhere in the federal budget. But let’s be honest: Any option would work only because some people would get less than they are currently slated to receive. Painful as that is, the question is whether other options on the table would be even more so.\n\nOur short-term fiscal challenges are significant as we grope our way toward a future in which we begin to pay down the federal debt. The long-term challenge of entitlements is much more severe, with implications both for our own well-being and for the long-term strength of the global economy. Yes, we remain the biggest player on the global stage, but if we fail to get our fiscal house in order, we could bequeath our descendants unconscionable debt and slow the global economy to boot. Is that to be our legacy?\n\nAt face value, fiscal policy may not seem a concern for the Federal Reserve. Taxing and spending, after all, are not the Fed’s business. Congress holds the power of the purse. But the Fed cannot be an indifferent bystander to the overall thrust of fiscal policy. The reason is straightforward: Bad fiscal policy creates pressure for bad monetary policy. When fiscal policy gets out of whack, monetary authorities face pressure to monetize the debt, a cardinal sin in my mind.\n\nI have spoken in previous speeches of our “faith-based currency,” a term I use only slightly tongue in cheek. The dollar—like the euro, the yen, the British pound and other currencies—is what economists call a fiat currency. It is backed only by the federal government’s power to raise the revenues needed to meet its obligations and by the rectitude of the U.S. central bank. If the market were to lose faith in either assumption, the dollar would be debased.\n\nThe Fed is not the answer to our fiscal woes. Remember, the executive proposes, and the legislative disposes. Congress, as keeper of the government’s purse and the sole body with the power to tax and spend the people’s money, is where the buck stops. Congress has the duty and the means to impose solutions to these imbalances, hopefully inspired by presidential leadership. And here is the rub: Voters like you elect the Congress. And you elect the president. You might chuckle at Sam Cohen’s answer to George Shultz’s question, but this is no laughing matter. Just as in the film From Here to Eternity, the lives of the cast of citizens of this great country are going to be dramatically altered by a calamitous development. The difference is that this one will come as no surprise; it is of our own making, and it is within our power to prevent. While we frolic in the surf of immediate economic prosperity and are consumed with all sorts of other political and economic melodramas and intrigues, we are being threatened not from some foreign enemy but from within.\n\nHistory may place blame on this or that president or on Congress for failing to act. But, ultimately, the responsibility to solve these looming fiscal issues rests with voters. In the end, the person who is responsible for the $83.9 trillion meltdown that is happening before our very eyes—the person responsible for saddling each of your children and every other person you love with $280,000 in debt—is the one you look at in the mirror each morning.\n\nThank you and have a nice Tax Day.",

        "content": "April 13, 2007 Houston, Texas\n\nWhen addressing an audience, it is customary for Federal Reserve officials to declare that they speak only for themselves and not for any other senior officials at the Fed, nor for any colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. That will be true today with one exception: I speak for everyone at the Federal Reserve in stating an admiration for the dynamism and spirit of this great city. Thank you for inviting me to this meeting of the Houston World Affairs Council.\n\nI am going to talk to you today about globalization. This is a trendy word these days, and I have no doubt that I am not the first person to address the topic of globalization before this august group. I doubt I am even the 10th or the 20th speaker from whose lips you have heard that now ubiquitous word.\n\nBut today, I am going to do something so shocking and rare that you may actually gasp in amazement: I am going to quote a French politician. And I am going to quote him approvingly, with apologies in advance that by doing so I might damage his presidential campaign.\n\nLast November, the Financial Times quoted Nicolas Sarkozy offering the French electorate a distinctly politically incorrect dose of reality. “Globalization is a fact,” Sarkozy said. “It would be as pointless to deny it or oppose it as to challenge the law of gravity or to stop the movement of the clouds. The question therefore is not whether globalization is good or bad. It is whether we are prepared for it.”\n\nI could not agree more. While it may be cathartic or politically convenient to cast negative aspersions on globalization, it is a futile exercise. We have passed the point of no return in the intermingling of the world’s economies. It is now a given. Mr. Sarkozy asks the right question: Are we prepared for it?\n\nThe economic impact of globalization is the topic of the Dallas Fed’s 2006 annual report essay, titled “The Best of All Worlds,” which we are releasing to the public today—as soon as I finish this speech. You will be the first to have it. Please take it home and read the essay written by Michael Cox and Richard Alm, two of the Dallas Fed’s best and most eloquent minds.\n\nThe essay points out that the simultaneous opening up of the world economy—especially the integration of markets due to the telecommunications revolution and the development of cyberspace—has changed the way every entrepreneur, every manager, and every business woman and man in America contemplates their cost of goods sold and the markets they sell to as they navigate into the future.\n\nThe essay explores 10 ways globalization raises productivity and reduces costs. I am going to summarize them for you. But first, let me set the stage with a story about a good friend of mine named Dr. Jonathan Weissler, who holds the chair in pulmonary research named for my late, great father-in-law, Jim Collins, at the University of Texas Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas, where Dr. Weissler is chief of medicine.\n\nWhen Dr. Weissler sees a patient, he, like most doctors, dictates examination notes into a recorder so that the information can be transcribed into the patient’s file. Nothing startling there; this has been standard medical practice for decades. What is new—and a hallmark of what we call the Knowledge Economy—is that instead of paying an on-site employee at UT Southwestern to transcribe his dictation, he sends the recording electronically to a company that farms the work out to English speakers around the world to transcribe overnight. They type up the notes for a fraction of the cost while Dr. Weissler sleeps. And voilà, they are on the good doctor’s desktop the next morning.\n\nIncidentally, Dr. Weissler says he can tell when the transcripts are produced in India because the English is perfect and even the most complex medical terms are spelled correctly—a testimony to the Indian ability to teach the blocking and tackling of proper English in their schools.\n\nBy reducing costs and streamlining his recordkeeping in this way, Weissler’s practice runs more efficiently and his staff can devote more time to serving patients. The real payoff is that the money saved can be reinvested into researching new ways to save and improve lives.\n\nDr. Weissler is more than prepared for globalization. Rather than cower before it, he is harnessing it. He is availing himself of resources created by the spread of knowledge around the world in order to save money and run an efficient operation. Therein lies an American-style answer to Monsieur Sarkozy’s pithy question.\n\nTo some this is alarming—especially those who focus on jobs lost to globalization, like the ones held by Texans and other Americans who once transcribed those notes for Dr. Weissler. Dwelling on these lost jobs or outsourced tasks ignores lessons of history. To be sure, we cannot and should not ignore the painful adjustments that economic advancement inflicts upon displaced workers; we should never underestimate the human costs of the process known to economists as creative destruction, a term coined by the iconic economist Joseph Schumpeter in 1942.\n\nI grew up in a household where my father suffered more than his fair share of the destructive side of that process. It was difficult for him to grasp the allure of the “creative” side of the equation, and I am more familiar with the anguish that comes when a breadwinner loses his job than I would like to be. But I consider it a fool’s errand to seek to somehow stop the momentum of globalization, particularly when one considers that jobs lost to globalization pale in comparison to jobs lost to the steady march of technological progress. I rarely hear the speakers who cast invective upon “globalization” also decry the evils of new technologies and innovation.\n\nIt is the job of our political leaders to provide a bridging mechanism for people like my dear old dad—God rest his hardworking soul—that mitigates the destruction without hindering the creative side of Schumpeter’s phenomenon.\n\nAmerican entrepreneurs and workers have developed a mastery of creative destruction—albeit with fits and starts—over the past 200 years. Our $13 trillion economy—the world’s biggest, by far—is proof that we can adapt to new circumstances and profit from the benefits those circumstances provide. To be prepared for globalization—to harness it and ride it to continued prosperity—we must remain at the forefront of the Information Age. We must master the Knowledge Economy.\n\nThe lesson of the essay is that globalization is spreading the Knowledge Economy around the globe—and the Knowledge Economy is accelerating the pace of globalization. While globalization itself is not new, it has gathered intensity over the past decade or so because of technologies that make it cheaper and easier to move information to nearly all corners of the world.\n\nWe have had decades to contemplate globalization in goods—many of which come through the Port of Houston—that were produced by cheap labor and abundant resources in faraway lands like China. But globalization has spread beyond manufactured goods to other segments of the economy, rapidly moving up the value-added ladder. Computers, the Internet, high-capacity fiber-optic cables and other marvels of modern communications fuel the extension of international competition into a broad realm of the economy that had been largely isolated from it. I am referring, of course, to the globalization of the services sector.\n\nMany services are still untouched by globalization. It remains impractical, for example, for a Houstonian to enjoy the pristine sushi freshly made by the dockside chefs who work around Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market, or to import the services of a barber who lives in Seville—sorry, I couldn’t resist that one. But many more services from all parts of the world can be delivered here in the blink of an eye (or in 40 winks of Dr. Weissler's eye overnight), thanks to the revolution in communication technologies that allow knowledge to overcome traditional impediments of distance.\n\nDr. Weissler shows us how some of the medical profession’s common support services have been globalized. Yet, his example is but the tip of the iceberg of the ways we can stretch the boundaries of high-skilled services. In 2001, a surgeon in New York, using robotic tools, removed the gallbladder of a patient 3,870 miles away in the French city of Strasbourg. In 2005, a laptop computer in Boston guided instruments as they performed heart surgery—unaided by human hands—on a patient in Milan, Italy. Geographic boundaries and technological impediments are evaporating even at the far reaches of the value-added realm.\n\nIt is trends like these that inspired us at the Dallas Fed to unleash Michael Cox and Rick Alm and our other researchers to consider the ways globalization is changing our economy.\n\nHere are the 10 ways in which globalization now impacts the Knowledge Economy. We have found that globalization lowers communication and transportation costs, point No. 1; fuels competition, point No. 2; and encourages specialization, point No. 3. A firm can now access labor, raw materials and other resources at any time and from anywhere on the globe, resulting in point No. 4: improved production functions.\n\nProducers can sell their goods and services to a larger market, No. 5, and extend their economies of scale, No. 6, by producing to satisfy global, not just domestic, demand.\n\nPoint No. 7, capital markets expand, freeing money to seek the highest return available globally and to fund development of new production capacity anywhere on the planet.\n\nPoint 8, knowledge spreads across towns, industries and countries, fueled by migration, the Internet, cell phones and trade.\n\nGlobalization erodes national or natural monopoly power, making markets more accessible to competition and more fair to consumers—or in other words, more “contestable,” point 9. And finally, increased production leads to increased consumption without reducing the amount available for others to consume, point 10. Just because I’m downloading the most recent episode of 24 from iTunes does not mean someone in Norway cannot download it, too.\n\nThe common thread among these 10 factors is that they all raise productivity’s level or its growth rate—or both. Higher productivity lowers costs. Lower costs restrain inflation, the bête noire of any progressive economy and the bane of Federal Reserve officials and central bankers everywhere. In this fundamental way, globalization raises the economy’s speed limit, allowing policymakers to relax a little and let the economy expand at rates that might once have been considered unsustainable. In a globalized world, faster growth need not carry the same inflationary implications it does in a closed world.\n\nThe Fed’s mandate calls for keeping inflation low while maintaining maximum sustainable economic growth—a duty we cannot fulfill without weighing productivity. Getting more output from existing labor and capital allows the economy to grow faster without igniting price pressures. We saw this vividly, for example, in the 1990s, when the IT revolution led to surging productivity, lower costs and faster growth. The Fed understood that increased supplies of goods and services, not inflationary excess demand, fueled the expansion, and it wisely let the economy seek a higher growth rate.\n\nConsidering all the dynamics of our globalized world, one problem monetary policymakers have is that we find ourselves lacking proper measuring sticks to capture these intangible dynamics. When a Boston doctor operates remotely on a patient in Milan, should we credit it to the U.S. economy or the Italian economy? A Barbie doll is designed in America and assembled in Malaysia from Taiwanese plastic pellets, Chinese cloth and Japanese nylon. Is the doll American or Malaysian or something else? When people in the U.S. and other countries can work together so seamlessly, how can we pull them apart with the data? Our annual report underscores how the world is fast becoming one big integrated economy, which suggests we should care as much about foreign output gaps, capacity utilization rates and unemployment rates as we do about our own.\n\nTraditional economic doctrine does not recognize the importance of foreign output to a country’s inflation rate. Only domestic output matters. But a new economic model, produced by the Dallas Fed, allows us to show that foreign output also matters. For central bankers, getting policy right will involve analyzing a great deal of additional data and overcoming blind spots about what’s going on in key parts of the world. We don’t, for example, know as much as we’d like about China’s capital stock, work hours and rural unemployment. We have no reliable estimates of the productive capacity in Brazil, India and Russia. All the data shortcomings are maddening, but they aren’t reason enough to deny the fundamental fact that globalization is changing the way our economies work.\n\nData that do not reflect the world in which we live increase the chances for errors in judgment. We need to develop much better measures for the global economy, particularly as services are increasingly traded. Today, our most detailed measures pertain to goods, a proportionally shrinking segment of our economy. We can tell you about agriculture and manufacturing in excruciating detail but have relatively little data about our fast-growing services sector—now 82 percent of U.S. employment. We have even less data on the global services economy.\n\nGlobalization doesn’t just drive down costs. It advances living standards in ways not captured by the standard economic measures of progress. We need new and better tools to help us determine just how globalization is affecting economies around the world, and how policymakers can reap benefits from these insights. Getting it right may well alter our notions of economic progress, with ramifications for how we approach the goal of price stability.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is hard at work researching this issue. We are in the process of establishing the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, and our economic research team—the same people who inform our Bank’s participation in the Federal Open Market Committee—is focused with laserlike intensity on advancing our knowledge of these underresearched and poorly understood phenomena.\n\nI hope that our annual report will give you insight into how the operators of our economy—men and women like yourselves who keep our mighty economic machine humming—address the Sarkozy Challenge. Are we prepared for globalization? The answer is in your hands.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "April 4, 2007 Austin, Texas\n\nPerceptions of risk lie in the eye of the beholder. Some see risk as a powerful force vital to capitalism; others consider it a four-letter word. The latter view may be gaining currency these days, with reports of risk coming home to roost in housing finance. Temporary problems in one industry, however, should not detract from the essential value of, need for and virtues of risk taking. We must be constantly mindful that prudent risk taking is the lifeblood of capitalism, and it is indeed a many splendored thing. If we had not taken risks, we would never have created from scratch the $13 trillion U.S. economy, the greatest economic machine in the history of the planet.\n\nEver since our ancestors decided that life was anything but predestined by supreme forces beyond their control, we have taken risks to advance our interests as we navigate our way toward the future. A young person who goes to college, for example, risks the certain income from today’s job, believing in the probability of a better paying one after graduation. Once we are in the workforce, life insurance hedges the risk that we might die before we have socked away enough money to provide for our families. As we accumulate excess savings, we place them at risk by investing in stocks and bonds to secure our retirement. We take risks by borrowing to finance our homes and our businesses, with the expectation that a brighter future will enable us to repay our debts and then some.\n\nThe impulse for risk gives rise to agents to service it, like the good people assembled in this room. Banks, insurance companies, investment banks, money managers, hedge funds and other financial intermediaries provide the means to package and distribute risk. In the old days, their job was fairly straightforward. The agents packaged straight-up risk instruments like letters of credit, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, simple loans and stocks, and fixed-rate mortgages. Today, assisted by technology and computational power that can assess probabilities faster than you can say “Keep Austin Weird,” financial intermediaries offer products to satisfy almost any risk taker’s needs.\n\nIn contemplating the present situation of our economy, one can easily become confused and distracted by the enormous array of risk instruments now available and by trying to figure out where the buck really stops. In sorting through it all, I find it helpful to bear in mind certain patterns that reemerge throughout history—patterns that are imprinted in human nature, independent of advances in financial sophistication. I would like to remind you of them today.\n\nThe views I am about to express, as always, are my own and not those of any other participant in the Federal Open Market Committee or the Federal Reserve. They are conditioned by personal experience.\n\nA substantial part of my personal experience involved spending some 20-odd years as a professional investor and hedge-fund manager pursuing the time-honored goal of buying a dollar’s worth of underlying value with nickels and dimes invested in publicly traded securities, including those of distressed banks, thrifts and other financial institutions in the aftermath of the 1980s. As mentioned in Bernie’s introduction, my partners and I succeeded in those endeavors more often than not, but that is not the point. The point is that I have experienced the process of risk taking as a market operator—the upside and the downside—at the microlevel, not just as a macroeconomic analyst.\n\nAnd yet, I am now the beneficiary of the collective knowledge of the Dallas Fed’s bank supervisors and analysts—those battle-hardened souls who navigated their way through Texas’ savings and loan, banking and real estate crises of the 1980s.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the following is one man’s perspective on the current scene.\n\nFirst, a little not-terribly-ancient history. In the 1980s, the euphoria of oil prices approaching $80 a barrel in today’s dollars led to a frenzy of lending activity in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. At least I think that’s what any reasonable observer would call the annual growth rate of business loans of over 40 percent at Texas banks and annual growth in commercial real estate lending of almost 50 percent that we saw in the early part of that decade. Booking assets at such a rapid clip has a \"come hither\" seductive power. In pursuit of a seemingly sure thing, more than 550 new banks were chartered in Texas from 1980 through 1985. This made for a volatile brew, combining dramatic rates of growth in activity with a dramatic expansion of the number of players with limited experience in navigating a reversal of fate, or what econometricians call a reversion to the mean. The assumption of permanently high—or permanently rising—prices in an asset class—in this case, oil—invariably leads to regrettable decisions.\n\nYou recall what ensued. By early 1981, reversion to the mean had begun. Real oil prices began to fall, contributing to an economic slowdown in the region’s most energy-sensitive areas, such as Houston. The regional economy held its own for a while, propelled by a red-hot commercial real estate sector. The state economy suffered a severe decline when oil collapsed to the current equivalent of $17 per barrel by mid-1986. Bank and thrift failures reached a frightful magnitude. More than 800 financial institutions went out of business in Texas during the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Nine of the 10 largest banking organizations based in Texas didn’t make it.\n\nThe energy bust reverberated through Texas, and it was keenly felt in both commercial and residential real estate markets. Office vacancies soared. In Dallas and Houston, they hovered around 30 percent, and they approached 40 percent here in Austin. Troubles in the residential sector got so bad that the city of Garland, a Dallas suburb, authorized a condo development project interrupted by the collapsed market to be set on fire; burning it to the ground seemed the best choice for the 240 unfinished condos that had become eyesores and safety hazards in the twinkle of a financial cycle’s eye.\n\nThat is pretty bracing stuff, but quickly forgotten when one looks around this state two decades later and sees a booming economy and rapid employment growth. Texas is attracting corporate headquarters and new citizens like bees to honey, is now the largest exporting state, is pumping on all economic cylinders, and is even having nice things written about its museums and restaurants in The New York Times. And the Houston and Austin and Dallas commercial real estate markets are hotter than Scarlett Johansson. Yet we mustn’t forget the dangers of miscalculating risk and the pain of corrections.\n\nTo be sure, we have made significant strides since the 1980s. Information technology has greatly improved the ability to measure and calibrate risk. The banking industry has taken advantage of the technology with its value-at-risk measurement and the formal statistical models that are the essence of the proposed Basel II bank capital requirements. It is now possible to mitigate risk through securitization and the use of derivative products to a degree that was unimaginable in the 1980s.\n\nAll these advances have increased liquidity, diversified portfolios and allocated risk to those more willing to bear it. At a very rapid rate, I might add. The majority of banks’ involvement in derivatives has been through interest rate swaps, which grew 26 percent last year. But the fastest growth has been in credit derivatives, which by some measures increased 55 percent last year and tenfold in the past three years or so.\n\nBy any accounting, growth in structured credit products has been enormous. As a result, many new players have now entered these markets—issuers and distributors as well as buyers. Slightly more than 40 percent of the collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, backed by corporate loans and rated by Moody’s last year were set up by first-time issuers that have not yet managed through a downturn in the credit cycle.\n\nThe memory cells begin to tingle. We are reminded that investors and financial institutions need to consider fully the potential for broad swings in financial markets to cause losses across a range of asset classes, even when losses may seem uncorrelated in a more benign environment. As we learned from our own experience here in Texas, adverse performance may be more correlated across assets than many expect, and the ramifications for pricing errors can be enormous.\n\nI often hear anecdotes of seemingly risk-laden financial deals fetching only bare-bones margins. Capital appears to be chasing one hot product after another, even as returns are compressed. In this regard, we should be mindful of the possibility that intense competition is causing investors to reach for yield and assume too much risk, just as Texas banks did in the 1980s with their aggressive shift from the faltering energy sector to the glitter of real estate.\n\nTo complicate the situation even further, there are reasons to suspect the recent surge in financial innovation, improperly understood, can intensify rather than mitigate the scope for error.\n\nI have just returned from a spring break vacation in the Caribbean with my daughter. While we were there, a local ichthyologist explained that fish have no memories and tend to swim in schools.\n\nWhen we were out of the water, my tutors in the Dallas Fed’s Research Department had me read a brief about the great economist Frank Knight—now best known as Milton Friedman’s teacher. And for pure reading pleasure, I took along a compendium of Charles Dickens’ works.\n\nThere are lessons about risk to be gleaned from all three: the fish expert, Frank Knight and Dickens. Let’s start with Knight.\n\nKnight viewed probabilities in three ways. The first and simplest is something like a roll of a fair die, where the odds of a six can be computed as one-sixth. Second are repeatable events, such as the proportion of widgets that might break on a production line. Here, experience can be a good teacher. If we observe three of 1,000 widgets breaking on Tuesday, a similar proportion might be expected to break on Wednesday. Third, there are unique events where probabilities can only be formed through judgments. For example, what is the probability that a certain new product might eventually rival the iPod or the Blackberry in popularity?\n\nIn Knight's view, it is easiest to position for risk in the first two circumstances. The most difficult and most important business decisions involve the third type of probability, where judgment plays a decisive role.\n\nThere is an ever-present risk that financial markets may be treating recent innovations as if they were in the second category, where probabilities can be based on experience, when in fact many new financial products still belong to the third category—the most difficult one, for which sound judgment is paramount. Many of today’s new financial innovations arguably have not been around long enough for their loss probabilities to be accurately estimated, despite the comfort provided by stochastic models and theoretical formulas.\n\nDanger lies in placing too much faith in historical value-at-risk estimates, especially when they are based on limited experience with new products. Wrong probabilities—whether they result from limited experience, model errors or just bad judgment—can lead to costly mistakes. The real world has a nasty habit of reminding us of this every so often—Texas in the late 1980s, Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s and the subprime mortgage market today.\n\nFor these reasons, value-at-risk estimates must be supplemented with stress testing and, most important, prudent judgment. It takes extraordinary discipline for financial institutions and investors to exercise sound judgment when the fish are schooling, swimming in pools of liquidity, unencumbered by memory.\n\nThe possibility that recent innovations may have reshaped both the positive and negative parameters of risk is evident in supervisors’ calls for financial institutions to control counterparty risk, such as in the case of credit default swaps. In these transactions, the purchasers of protection can offload the risk of their original positions but depend on a third party as guarantor. Credit risk has simply been replaced by counterparty risk, about which we might not know as much as we should.\n\nHere is where Dickens comes in. In his book Martin Chuzzlewit, one of his characters utters this classic description of financial markets:\n\nAnd then there is my favorite quote from Little Dorrit, sounding the alarm bells when, as Dickens put it, “a person who cannot pay gets another person who cannot pay to guarantee that he can pay.”\n\nMore than 150 years ago, Dickens foreshadowed one of today’s more vexing problems with structured products: knowing just where the risk is or who is ultimately holding it—who ultimately pays should things go wrong. A growing awareness of the potential domino effects of counterparty risk has been emerging, where knowledge of one’s counterparty depends on the counterparty’s counterparty.\n\nIf you’re looking for a financial market segment where these issues have come home to roost, you need look no further than the subprime mortgage industry.\n\nOnly recently have we seen widespread use of a number of innovative mortgage products, such as interest-only loans and option ARMs. And these innovations are now common even in the subprime sector, which itself has grown tremendously. The most innovative mortgage products have tended to be used more in markets with the greatest home-price appreciation, suggesting some homebuyers stretched themselves financially to purchase increasingly expensive homes. In many cases, homebuyers may have had no other choice if they wished to purchase a home.\n\nBy easing the qualifying process, these instruments have made home mortgage credit available to broader segments of society—bringing “money in a hundred shapes and ways,” to quote Dickens’ Tigg. Indeed, many families own homes today thanks to subprimes and mortgage product innovations. That’s the good news: Financial innovation has made it possible for more Americans than ever to have a tangible piece of the American Dream, including those whom some lenders know no more about than they do of the “crossing-sweeper at the corner.” The bad news is that these very innovations have left homebuyers exposed to a decline in the housing market or rising interest rates, or both. We must not forget that these new products have yet to be tested in a credit-cycle downturn.\n\nA student of Dickens or of financial market history might have expected problems to arise in subprime lending. Relaxed standards and documentation requirements are typically part of aggressive lending strategies that accompany asset price booms, and subprime lenders are no exception. Some subprime agents on the West Coast and in Florida and elsewhere in the nation seem to have been as aggressive and as undiversified as the Texas banks and S&Ls were in the 1980s. Just as we had oil prices fueling our lending boom in the 1980s, today’s mortgage explosion has been fed by a combination of low interest rates and some spectacular growth in home prices.\n\nThus far, the damage from the subprime market has been largely contained, as many of my Federal Reserve counterparts have been saying. Why do we say so? To begin with, quality problems have risen primarily for adjustable-rate subprime loans, which are only about 8.5 percent of home mortgage debt outstanding. Also, much of this debt was packaged into private-label mortgage-backed securities with the downside risk spread out over a diverse group of investors. Nevertheless, because 40 percent of homebuyers last year were nonprime (subprime and Alt-A) borrowers, housing markets may feel some short-term pain, making it less clear whether housing construction has bottomed and how long the housing downturn may last. Fortunately, the financial system and the economy are strong enough to weather this storm.\n\nWhile the subprime damage is largely contained, I do not mean that the market will or should refrain from punishing those who neglected time-proven rules of prudence. Nor am I suggesting that the neglect of prudent practices has not bled into other types of credit—such as the Alt-A market. Indeed, it would be atypical for lax lending standards in one area of credit not to lead to laxity in others. Nor am I placing excessive faith in models that have yet to be tested by real developments.\n\nThe subprime situation may well be a blessing in disguise. It reminds us that history does have the capacity to repeat itself. The old financial axioms—levelheaded notions such as “know your customer” (or your counterparty) and “there is a difference between price and value”—remain valid. I expect market discipline to reassert itself, swiftly punishing those who pressed the limits of imprudence or suffered selective amnesia, hopefully doing so in a way that staves off the impulse for lawmakers and regulators to interfere disproportionately.\n\nI acknowledge that is a tall order. But I am encouraged by what I see developing. As a former market operator, I take comfort in knowing that over time markets always clear. To be sure, the economy will grow somewhat more slowly because of the correction in the housing market. At the same time, other pistons in our economic engine, particularly consumption, continue pumping. And a buildup in housing inventory means that responsible buyers will be able to purchase homes at more affordable prices. We may have had a glimpse into this process in the National Association of Realtors report of pending home sales released yesterday.\n\nIn addressing the subprime issue, regulatory agencies are working hard to avoid causing an overreaction with credit standards that would needlessly cause too much of a slowdown in housing or the overall economy. And we do not want to stifle financial innovation simply because some problems have arisen in one sector.\n\nPolicymakers can learn a great deal from what they did wrong in the debacle of the 1980s. Back then, regulators and lawmakers had imposed product restrictions—especially on thrifts—that made diversification difficult. These limits were later relaxed—but only after the thrifts had been weakened. Back then, interstate branching restrictions limited banks’ ability to diversify geographically. Tax laws encouraged commercial real estate investment in 1981, but new policies discouraged it in 1986. A policy of regulatory forbearance and its associated moral hazard problems contributed to the lending excess. So-called “zombie thrifts” were allowed to operate when they should have been closed down, encouraging otherwise-bankrupt institutions to “bet the bank” in highly speculative ventures. If it paid off, fine; if not, the taxpayer would foot the bill. In the end, it cost over $65 billion to clean up the Texas S&L industry alone.\n\nI expect some of you will argue that the Federal Reserve also compounded the problem. It is true that breaking the back of looming hyperinflation in the 1980s required the FOMC to push short-term interest rates as high as 19 percent—way above the rates thrift institutions were earning on their older, fixed-rate mortgages. The resulting losses depleted much of the S&L industry’s capital. Back then, Texas and the other energy belt states felt the pain of the eventual correction, much as the coasts are currently feeling the aftershocks of an excessive speculation in housing that was fueled by a combination of low short-term interest rates and advances in financial technology.\n\nBy always bearing in mind the potential for policymakers to compound rather than solve problems, the Fed and other regulators are doing their level best to tread very carefully in dealing with the subprime situation. Mindful of this, I think the recent subprime mortgage statement put out for comment by the Fed and four other regulators gets the notion of sensible risk taking just about right.\n\nFirst, it asks lenders to ensure that borrowers understand the risks in their mortgages. Second, it specifies that an institution’s analysis of a borrower’s repayment capacity should verify an ability to repay the debt by its maturity date at the fully indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule.\n\nThese common sense principles should enable homebuyers who reasonably expect higher future incomes to temporarily benefit from lower initial mortgage payments. They also recognize that lenders need to see whether borrowers can be reasonably expected to handle the transition from an initial teaser rate or interest-only option.\n\nYou are mortgage bankers. You know what the situation is and what it calls for. I would simply ask that you stick to the basics in your lending practices and that you inform us regulators as to what reasonable measures might be contemplated to make sure that any problems in the subprime sector remain “contained” and do not lead to systemic contamination.\n\nSubprime mortgages are a segment of the financial marketplace in which risk might have been abused. But this in no way denigrates the invaluable role that taking risk plays in our economy. It all comes down to a question of proportion. It is worth keeping in mind the old toxicology dictum that “the dose makes the poison,” a shortened version of a saying attributed to a 16th century Swiss chemist named Paracelsus. “All things,” Paracelsus wrote, “are poison and nothing is without poison, only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.”\n\nI regard risk and risk taking as a good thing. Mae West once quipped that “too much of a good thing is never enough.” Paracelsus may not be as funny, but I prefer his message. The dose determines whether risk is healthy or ruinous.\n\nFinancial markets price risk 24/7. Whether they get it right, of course, is another matter. For mortgage bankers, knowing your customers and potential exposures is requisite to getting it right. A roll of the dice is something else, as is working under the presumption that returns can be made while someone else incurs all your risk. Remember that passage from Little Dorrit. Astute observers recognize that third-party assurances may provide only illusory protection from risk.\n\nIn talking about risk today, I have been a bit of a worrywart. That goes with the job. After all, we are the guys who have the reputation of taking away the punchbowl before the party gets out of hand. I think this is the proper role for the Fed to play, though it is hardly a strategy for winning popularity contests. That said, we believe in the elixir of risk, properly dosed. To thrive, capitalism needs risk taking. Risk is a many splendored thing that drives investment, innovation and growth. A wise man once said, “A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.” Risk takers—mortgage bankers like you and countless others—build and launch the ships that sail our economy forward.\n\nThe elimination of risk can never be the goal of any type of policymaker in a capitalist system. Risk becomes a problem only when it is excessive or when it is abused—a proposition that is especially true in today’s environment, where financial markets are increasingly globally integrated and information moves with the click of a mouse.\n\nThe main concern for policymakers is the potential for excessive risk taking to result in systemic problems. So far, that has not happened, and we are working double time, overtime to make sure it does not. Policymakers need to remain vigilant in seeking the right balance between prudent and indiscriminate risk taking. As do you.\n\nAmen to that. Amen to fish. Amen to Charles Dickens, Mae West, Frank Knight and Paracelsus. And to Bernie Bernfeld for inviting me to speak here today. Thank you.",

        "content": "February 27, 2007 Austin, Texas\n\nI am delighted to be here at the Headliners Club and in Austin tonight. It is good to see so many people I have worked with and yet still admire: Frank Gavin and Jim Steinberg are but two. I am delighted and honored that Elspeth Rostow is here. It is even good to see George Shipley.\n\nComing in from the airport, I actually saw that fabled bumper sticker calling on voters to “Keep Austin Weird.” It reminded me of the old saw that Washington is 10 square miles surrounded by reality. Austin might be justly proud to consider itself 266 square miles surrounded by normality. But I know better. As George is well aware, about the only thing I accomplished when I ran for the U.S. Senate in 1994 was that I managed to have a dip cone in every Dairy Queen in Texas. I know almost every nook and cranny of this state. And I know there is nothing normal about Texas.\n\nTake my wife’s family, for example. Her great-great grandfather was William Miles. He hailed from Nip ’n Tuck, Texas, a little town near what is now Longview in East Texas. He served gallantly in the Mexican Wars and then, after a substantial interlude, joined the 14th Regiment of the Texas Unmounted Cavalry—they had no horses but called themselves “cavalry” nonetheless—and went off to fight for the Confederacy. He had his arm shot off in battle, was discharged and sent home. To get back, he swam across the Mississippi—no small feat for a one-armed man. He is memorialized by the nickname “Sidestroke” in the family annals. Old William Miles walked back to Nip ’n Tuck and became a dirt farmer.\n\nHe was a tough old bird. Having come home from the “War of Northern Aggression,” he could not afford a mule, so he hitched a plow to his six daughters—there was a seventh but she got smart, married a Yankee and was promptly disowned. William Miles never spent a dime; he saved every penny he earned and prospered handsomely. He died in 1910. His will instructed an executor to auction off all he had accumulated—his house, his equipment, everything but his remaining daughters—so his net worth could be calculated in hard currency.\n\nAll this is captured on his tombstone in the Gum Springs graveyard near Longview. His stone records the dates of his and Nancy Miles’ births and deaths, and the dates of his service in both the Army of the U.S.A. and the Army of Jefferson Davis. On the back of the stone, for all the world to see, are carved the words “Value of my estate $44, 378.34.” That’s roughly $956,000 in today’s dollars. That’s the good news. He died a rich man. The bad news is that his will required his daughters to buy everything back that was sold in his estate sale.\n\nYou cannot tell me that Austin has a corner on the market for being “weird.”\n\nEvery now and then, I like to pick up T. R. Fehrenbach’s wonderful little tome The Seven Keys to Texas. It contains keen insights about our culture, even if he was a Princetonian and it was written in 1983. One of his essential points captures the bottom line of iconic Texas characters like William Miles. If memory serves—and I am paraphrasing here—Fehrenbach argued that the rest of the country used to be characterized by faceless men running big organizations, whereas Texas was operated by big men running faceless organizations. Update this for gender, and I think the remnants of that culture still remain, embodied in people like Ann Richards, Jim Baker, Bob Bullock, Lyndon Johnson, Elspeth Rostow and countless others, past and present, in the public and private sectors, in arts and academia and elsewhere. Many of them may be a bit too strong for some and a little quirky for outside observers, but they embody a spirit that is uniquely and beautifully Texan.\n\nFehrenbach defined Texas as a state of mind. As his book jacket noted, it may not be an entirely rational state of mind, but it sure as heck works. It is what makes Texas so fantastic. It forms the cultural yeast that makes for a vital and vibrant economic engine.\n\nAnd vibrant it is.\n\nIn 2005, Texas generated more than $1 trillion in output. Measured in dollars, it is more than Brazil produced and a smidge less than Canada did. It is 25 percent more than India produced. Imagine that. The 24 million people of the Lone Star State produced $200 billion more in output than the 1.1 billion people of India.\n\nWe export more than California. We manufacture more than New York. We have more Fortune 500 companies headquartered here than either of them.\n\nLast year, employment grew twice as fast in Texas as it did in the rest of the United States. Construction payrolls grew at five times the U.S. rate. We added 26,000 net new factory jobs in 2006, while the nation’s manufacturers posted an overall loss of 110,300 jobs. The energy sector grew its workforce by over 13 percent, well outpacing the rest of the country’s 7.5 percent rate. Our energy sector still only employs about 2 percent of our workforce. Texas excels at the high-value-added end of the equation: Our output per worker in computers and electronics has overtaken California’s.\n\nWith the nation’s economic growth slowing, you would expect ours to tamp down a bit. Yet our latest Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, released yesterday, showed that momentum is continuing to build in Texas factories and that businesses headquartered here remain optimistic about the future.\n\nIn December, the state’s unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest it has been since 1982. Employment is robust in Texas. And it will remain so, assuming the Perez sisters and the good people who work at Las Manitas—in my book the best eatery west of the Maginot Line—continue operating.\n\nAt last count, the state’s population grew by more than 579,000 souls in a year. That’s 65 percent of a Detroit, three-quarters of a San Francisco, almost the entire population of Minneapolis and St. Paul combined, an entire Denver, a Kansas City, a Boston proper, a Washington, D.C., and more than the entire population of functioning OU alumni. In one year. And yet we created enough jobs to bring unemployment down to 4.5 percent.\n\nWe are blessed with being participants in a remarkable economic machine. So, what role do the 1,300 employees at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso play in all this?\n\nFirst, we run a business that keeps the payments system and our district’s banks working to meet the needs of our citizens. We pump money through the veins and capillaries of Texas’ cardiovascular system, so that her economic muscles can flex and grow.\n\nLast year, the Dallas Fed processed 940 million paper checks worth over $1 trillion. We processed more than 700,000 electronic checks per day.\n\nAlso, 6.1 billion banknotes—ones, twos, fives, tens, twenties, fifties and hundreds—passed through our vaults and onward to banks and ATMs last year. That’s $105 billion in cash. The notes are scanned by machines that sort 90,000 of them an hour and pluck out $517 million worth of worn currency each month for shredding.\n\nA dollar bill, by the way, costs 5.4 cents to make at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. It lasts 18 months before we shred it and send it to money heaven. A $20 bill lasts four years. A $100 bill lasts nine years.\n\nWe store all those bills in our five-story-deep vault under the 1,204,000 square feet that is the footprint of our Dallas property and in the newly constructed vault in Houston. And we handle a lot of coins. If you ever need to wash your car or do your laundry, call me. We have some 209 million quarters in our vaults.\n\nIn addition to processing checks and cash, the Dallas Fed supervises and regulates 38 state member banks, 450 bank holding companies, and 29 agencies and representative offices of foreign banking organizations in our district. Our bank “sup and reg” people in Dallas are some of the most experienced in the nation. You know why, if you have even a modicum of memory of the banking debacle of the 1980s.\n\nOne of the best folkloric moments in Fed history came about when my predecessor two iterations ago, a wonderful man named Bob Boykin, told then Fed Chairman Paul Volcker of the massive excavation taking place in Dallas for building the Crescent Court complex. “Mr. Chairman,” Bob said, “in Dallas, we have just dug the deepest hole in American history.” To which Volcker responded: “Literally or figuratively?”\n\nIn addition to feeding the payments system and making sure the banking system is sound, we work hard to promote financial literacy in our district, conducting workshops for high school teachers and educators and supplying straightforward reading and interactive materials with titles like Building Wealth, so that Texans will be better equipped to manage, safeguard and grow their money. We also expend a great deal of effort promoting and encouraging community development throughout our district.\n\nAnd we conduct research on the U.S. economy and on the effects of globalization on the gearing of the economy and its consequences for monetary policy. Our researchers make up one of the nation’s finest in-house teams of economists, a team that includes Finn Kydland, the 2004 Nobel Prize-winning economist who has been an associate of our Bank for some 14 years now.\n\nWe run these business lines at a cost that is less than what we earn in fees and on our allocation of the returns on the $35 billion in assets on our balance sheet. You are looking at one of the few people on the planet—there are 12 such men and women serving as presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks scattered around the nation—who is privileged to run a government business that handed over $1 billion to the U.S. Treasury last year after covering our expenses and paying dividends to our shareholders.\n\nOf course, the sexiest part of what we do—judging by the amount of voyeurism it incites in the press corps, bloggers and other observers—is the policymaking process. As I mentioned, there are 12 Federal Reserve Banks. Eight times a year, we sit at a table with the seven governors of the Federal Reserve System in what is called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC. That is where the base interest rate—the federal funds rate—is chosen and where monetary policy is set. It is done by consensus, with each participant taking part in a discussion presided over by the chairman, Ben Bernanke, who is as good and fair and smart a man as I have had the pleasure to know.\n\nEach person at the table, starting with the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, is called on to give his or her view of the economy from their various perches. Then another round ensues, and each is asked for a recommended policy course of action: Should we hold rates steady or raise or lower them, and why? We debate language for a written statement that expresses the committee’s view. And then a tally of the preferences of the voting members is taken, and the deed is done. The vote and the statement on the vote are released by 2:15 in the afternoon.\n\nWhat guides us in those discussions? An earnest intention to deliver on our congressional mandate to conduct monetary policy so as to provide sustainable noninflationary employment growth.\n\nOf course, some people cast negative aspersions on the Fed. They think we are a collective of sourpusses who get some perverse pleasure out of being tight with money, like old William Miles was.\n\nOne of our fabled chairmen, William McChesney Martin, addressed this perception when he was nominated on the Alfalfa Party ticket to run for the presidency of the United States.\n\nSome of you may not know about this group. It is a club that meets once a year in Washington to drink and be merry, so called because the alfalfa plant will drink anything, anywhere. They nominate a presidential candidate every time they meet, who, without having to wait for the inevitable outcome, is immediately inducted into the Harold Stassen Society—a tribute to the perfect presidential election record of Mr. Stassen. Candidates are expected to live up to the motto “Veni, Vidi, Defici”: I came, I saw, I lost—kind of like my Senate experience. Some great Texans have headed up the Alfalfa ticket. Among them were John Connally, Bob Strauss, Lloyd Bentsen, and both Bush “41” and “43,” well before they were elected president in the real deal.\n\nThis year, it was a former cowgirl named Sandra Day O’Connor. In 1966, it was Bill Martin, who had been chairman of the Federal Reserve System for 15 years by then, who received the Alfalfa nomination.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, which is on file at the LBJ Library by the way, Martin said that as Federal Reserve chairman he had long taken his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, who, he pointed out, said that “people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Martin announced, if he were to adopt a political platform as a presidential candidate, he planned to “make life endurable again, by stamping out prosperity.”\n\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” Martin said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found at home and abroad, ask their advice…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel.… I say to you that America is at the crossroads. And I shall do everything I can to keep it there.”\n\nI assure you that those of us who have the privilege of providing “conflicting counsel” at the FOMC table, including yours truly, have no desire to keep our economy “at the crossroads.” Day in, day out, we strive to keep it moving, faithful to our dual mandate, so that we might engender prosperity both for Texas and for the nation.\n\nWith that, I rest my case. I thank you for the dinner and drinks you are about to serve. And I conclude with a quote from John O’Connor, Justice O’Connor’s husband, who once reminded me, “You need not drink to enjoy yourself, but why take the risk?”",

        "content": "February 16, 2007 Harlingen, Texas\n\nThank you, General Cheney. Our paths first crossed in 1967, when we entered the Naval Academy as skinny little plebes. We had many things drilled into us that year, starting with every instructional quote from a book called “Reef Points” that we had to carry with us at all times. One quote was the John Paul Jones creed: An officer is a “gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor.”\n\nGeneral, you left Annapolis and went on to a distinguished career as the prototypical, ideal officer in the Marine Corps, and you have lived up to John Paul Jones’ creed in spades. I am proud of you for being such a good man. And I am proud and honored to have been your classmate.\n\nYou remember, of course, that we also had drilled into us the essential need to always be exact—to never exaggerate or boast or misrepresent anything, anywhere, at anytime. In the Marine Corps and the Navy, people’s lives depend on you, and taking liberties with the facts can place them in danger. Of course, old warriors earn the right to exaggerate just a little, especially when they talk about the past exploits of friends. Which is another way of saying that I will forgive Steve’s taking liberties in that introduction. That sounded a lot better than how a no-nonsense, tell-it-straight Steve Cheney would have said it when we were by-the-letter midshipmen: “Ladies and gentleman, tonight’s guest is Richard Fisher. He works for a bank.”\n\nThe Marine Military Academy is lucky to have you at its helm, Steve. I am grateful to be here as your guest tonight at this General H. M. Smith Foundation Dinner and very honored—and, frankly, surprised—to receive the Iwo Jima Leadership Award.\n\nI have a great staff at the Dallas Fed, where 1,300 patriotic men and women work hard at all the things our central bank does—from crafting monetary policy that helps fuel America’s mammoth, $13 trillion economy without igniting inflation, to keeping the banking system sound and the payments system humming so that billions of dollars in currency and checks get to where they are needed, as needed.\n\nMy colleagues at the Fed were excited to hear I was receiving this honor tonight. I asked a handful of them to suggest some of their favorite quotes about leadership, which I might use to inspire you and the cadets this evening. They came up with some pretty good ones:\n\nFrom Winston Churchill: “Never give in—never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.”\n\nFrom Robert E. Lee: “Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or keep one.”\n\nFrom Gen. George S. Patton: “Never”—these Great Men sure like to use the word “never”—“tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.”\n\nFrom Dwight D. Eisenhower: “Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.”\n\nFrom Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf: “Going to war without France is like going deer hunting without your accordion.” Whoa, how did that one get in here? I’ll have to use my leadership skills to get that speechwriter to want to pursue another profession.\n\nAnd here is one about the greatest corps of leaders anywhere on the planet, a great comment from Ronald Reagan: “Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference. The Marines don’t have that problem.”\n\nMen and women of conviction and purpose—especially those given to punctilious courtesy and the nicest sense of personal honor—lead us into the future unafraid of the obstacles that might deter others, just as their military counterparts, like Gen. Holland “Howlin’ Mad” Smith, fearlessly led their comrades into battle in World War II. (Mind you, no central banker would want a nickname like that; something tells me that neither a “Howlin’ Mad” Bernanke nor a “Howlin’ Mad” Greenspan would have been appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve.)\n\nGreat words of wisdom can inspire us, but they are not what determine who we are. Character comes from our upbringing and our experiences—and it is on this very personal level that I want to address the members of the Corps of Cadets who are with us tonight.\n\nI have been in your shoes. At 14, I was shipped from California to Admiral Farragut Academy in Toms River, N.J., a school like this one, but run according to naval tradition. It was a tough and unforgiving place. General Cheney’s counterpart, our headmaster, was named Raven O. Dodge. He had one arm. We lived in fear of him. But we respected him, even if the guys on the swim team called him “Sidestroke.”\n\nWe rose at 6:15 every morning, mustered out to the parade field for inspection and marched to breakfast in formation. We had morning classes and then formed up and marched to lunch with our drum and bugle corps. After lunch came afternoon classes, then at 3:30 we were off to activities and sports, and then, for the last time for the day, we formed up again and marched to dinner at 6. We went straight to our rooms after dinner to do homework before lights-out at 10. On weekends, we had full-dress parades. We learned how to handle weapons and, being at a naval academy prep school, how to tie knots and navigate by the stars.\n\nMy buddies back home thought I was nuts. They were with their families, dating good-looking girls, driving cars, spending money, having fun, sleeping late and doing things on their own good time. I was in New Jersey for four years marching to meals, studying hard, leading a highly disciplined life and getting by on a $2-a-week allowance. We got $5 a week as seniors, but it didn’t make a whole lot of difference because we only got out on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. My life and my friends’ lives were as different as night and day. Sound familiar?\n\nI wouldn’t go back and change any of it because the lessons I learned in those four years made it possible for me to accomplish all those things that General Cheney bragged on earlier. We learned to internalize—to come by as instinct—all those attributes mentioned so eloquently in those great leaders’ quotations. We learned the values of camaraderie and esprit de corps, and that semper fidelis was more than a slogan. Being faithful to your country, your mission and your potential is reward in itself.\n\nWe also learned a lesson that is quintessentially American. When you wear a uniform and you live in the same dorms and eat the same food in the same place, nobody cares whether you are rich or poor or where you or your parents came from. I was the son of immigrants. My father never got past fourth grade; my mother was a secretary. I was at school with a lot of rich boys who had great legacies and fancy bloodlines, but it didn’t make a bit of difference. You moved up in rank according to your effort and achievement. You got what you earned and you earned what you got.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times people have asked me: Just how did you get to Annapolis and Harvard and all those fancy schools? How did you end up on Wall Street, make money, become an ambassador and get to do all those high-sounding things in Washington? How did you end up working with Kissinger? And how did you get to sitting at the table with Greenspan and Bernanke at the Federal Reserve? What’s your secret?\n\nWell, it does help to have good luck on your side—serendipity comes in mighty handy. I have had more than my share of it. But I believe that the lessons and discipline learned at Farragut Academy, just like those you are learning here, are what made a lot of that good luck possible.\n\nAs to “the secret,” you can forget all those quotes my great staff came up with. I’m going to give it to you straight from the ultimate source: Oprah Winfrey. As accomplished an American as you will ever find, she said it best: “The big secret in life is that there is no big secret. Whatever your goal, you can get there if you’re willing to work.”\n\nThat hits the nail on the head. That, and remembering you never, my friends, never, never, never, go deer hunting with an accordion.\n\nThank you. Semper Fi.",

        "content": "February 9, 2007 Dallas, Texas\n\nI am delighted to finally get to speak to the Park Cities Rotary. Before I went up to Washington to serve as a trade negotiator, I was a member of the Downtown Dallas Rotary. When my travels took me elsewhere, I would drop in on club luncheons to share the Rotarians’ patriotism, camaraderie and fellowship and to delight in their sense of humor. My all-time favorite Rotary memory is from a meeting I attended while Nancy and I were vacationing with our children in Georgia. The local club had a ritual of reading aloud the names of ill or deceased members and asking for a moment of silence. They announced one fellow’s name, Harry Someoneorother, who had been inactive for some time and was reported dead. To everyone’s surprise, old Harry wandered in at the conclusion of the moment of silence. Without skipping a beat, the chairman stood up, recognized him and gave him the award for longest distance traveled.\n\nI imagine Paul Harris would have grinned at that one. His wit was matched by his vision. His exhortation 102 years ago to “place emphasis on giving rather than getting” has inspired generations of Rotarians. The Federal Reserve, by the way, was the beneficiary of that giving spirit: Paul Volcker, who is considered by many to be Zeus in the pantheon of central banking gods, studied at the London School of Economics as a Rotary Foundation Scholar.\n\nI want to talk to you today about the business of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. I know you would rather have me talk about monetary policy and where interest rates might be headed. Let me disappoint you up front by telling you I am not going to do that. We held our most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting last week, and we decided to hold the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent, where it has been since June 29. My views on the economy have not changed over the past week, even with the subsequent release of fourth quarter GDP data.\n\nIn fact, my views haven’t changed since my last formal speech shortly before Christmas, which coincidentally, was to a group of Rotarians in Longview. So I’ll quote from that speech to summarize how I feel about the economy today: “My guess is that we are most likely going to finish the year at a pace that exceeds the gloomy forecasts making all the headlines lately.” I suggested to the Longview club that “if you net the downdrafts from the housing and auto sectors against the tailwinds from other countries growing faster than the United States, then adjust for the updrafts of a dynamic service sector and thank your lucky stars for a warm start to winter and burgeoning oil and gas inventories that have softened energy prices, I wouldn’t be surprised if the economy proves to have grown at better than 2 percent, net of inflation, in the second half of this year, then picks up pace in 2007.”\n\nWell, the initial release of fourth quarter GDP proved to be a gee-whiz number of 3.5 percent, which pulled up the economy from its tepid 2 percent growth rate in the third quarter. In coming months, the fourth quarter number will be revised to account for more fulsome data on inventories, construction activity and other inputs, and it could well be revised downward. My sense is that in the end, fourth quarter growth was still in the range of 3 percent.\n\nAt this early juncture in 2007, I think it entirely reasonable to expect the economy to maintain an average pace of 3 percent growth for the year. And, if we at the Fed do our job well, we should be able to accommodate that growth rate while bringing inflation down below 2 percent.\n\nIf you’ll permit me to again use a meteorological metaphor: We have some disinflationary tailwinds assisting us. There was a series of monetary policy tightenings by the FOMC that preceded the latest series of pauses that began last August. Also, moderation in energy prices proved beneficial, while continued productivity gains, although less than we had expected, should keep labor costs in check. And spillovers from the unwinding of excessive housing market speculation, including softening in the price of lumber and such commodities as zinc and copper, have all added force to the tailwinds we’ve been seeing. I find it instructive that, other than from corn farmers, I no longer hear business leaders muttering about “pricing power,” which not too long ago was an ever-present part of inflation discussions.\n\nYet, we do have some inflationary headwinds to overcome. For example, economists use a theoretical metric that attempts to measure the costs of housing—something they refer to as “owner’s equivalent rent,” or OER. OER makes up the largest individual component of the core price index for consumer expenditures, with a 14 percent weight in the index. The way the math works, when the price of the nation’s housing stock declines, this rent equivalent increases. At year end, it was rising at a rate of 4.3 percent, adding to inflationary pressures. Also, the substantial demand for skilled and some semiskilled labor is driving up wages in those important labor pools. And rapid growth in foreign economies—from China and India to our southern neighbors and our friends across the Atlantic—increases global resource utilization, tightening the availability and prices of inputs and labor that American businesses use to control their cost-of-goods-sold and enhance their productivity.\n\nWe will monitor the net effect of these headwinds and tailwinds.\n\nI wouldn’t rule out further increases in the federal funds rate if inflationary winds gain the upper hand. Indeed, if increases are needed, I would aggressively advocate for them. But for now, I am as comfortable with the inflationary outlook as a prudent central banker can be. No central banker can ever be smug about containing the risk of inflation, but I am pleased with the current direction of inflationary impulses. To quote from the FOMC statement released after our meeting last week: “Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months, and inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time.” That said, I will rest a heck of a lot easier when we get the core rate down well below 2 percent and keep it there.\n\nMind you, this is what we are paid to do. But there are other ways to deal with inflationary pressures. Only this week, we saw one alternative approach being taken by the government of Zimbabwe, which, according to Wednesday’s New York Times, declared inflation “illegal,” promising to arrest and punish anyone who raises prices or wages. And the Financial Times reports that in Argentina, the government, apparently dissatisfied with the index used to measure inflation, sought to remedy the situation by replacing the economist who compiles it. Fortunately, we don’t have those options. Instead, we continue to monitor price developments and discharge our duty the old-fashioned way, as always, seeking to promote sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth.\n\nSubstantial dividends accrue from a disciplined Federal Reserve. Let me cite just one example that may not readily come to mind. It wasn’t too long ago that the markets were fretting about underfunded liabilities of pension plans. Recent equity market rallies around the world have mitigated that risk. Pension fund managers now have ample opportunities to secure some of their long-term funding needs in the higher quality tranches of the bond market. The 30-year Treasury bond yields 4.84 percent. If my math is right, this means someone can buy so-called stripped bonds that mature in 2037 at $100 for 25 cents on the dollar, thus matching every dollar of their long-term liabilities for a quarter. Of course, prudent fund managers would only do that if they were confident that the Fed would continue to protect the purchasing power of those strips. If we continue to contain inflation, they will—strengthening the financial security of American workers.\n\nEnough said about the economy. The Federal Reserve System does more than just conduct monetary policy, and I want you to know a little bit more about the Dallas Fed and the role it plays in this city and in the economy.\n\nLet’s start with a little history. President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. The act contemplated 12 regional banks across the country, and George Dealey at the Dallas Morning News immediately went to work to get one of them for Dallas. On April 3, 1914, Dealey succeeded—the same day, for those of you who are history buffs, that Pancho Villa’s forces captured the town of Torreon. Other notable events in 1914 included the completion of the Panama Canal, the start of World War I and the invention of the air conditioner. I will leave it up to you to decide which of those events has had the most significant impact on our city!\n\nFew Dallas institutions have survived as long as the Dallas Fed. We have been part of the downtown community since we opened, moving from temporary quarters into a stately building on Akard Street in 1921, and then to our current building on Pearl Street, just opposite the Arts District, in 1992. We have the third longest continuous business presence in downtown Dallas and are proud of it. Of the remaining downtown institutions, only the Morning News and Neiman Marcus predate our arrival.\n\nThe Dallas Fed has been at its best in hard times. During the Great Depression, our employees voluntarily took 5 percent pay cuts so the Bank could share the work and hire unemployed Dallasites. In an earlier recession, panicked customers stampeded a Dallas bank, demanding to withdraw their money. It was the kind of run that could ruin a bank. The head of the Dallas Fed, a man named W. F. Ramsey, showed up in an armored car with guards. They hauled a quarter million dollars into the lobby—where everyone could see it. In a scene right out of It’s a Wonderful Life, Ramsey jumped on a desk and shouted across the crowded lobby that he had $30 million more sitting in the Fed’s vault down the street. Just like that, the bank run ended.\n\nThe Fed has come a long way from its early years. Today, we have $39 billion in assets on our balance sheet. Last year we generated enough income to send $1 billion back to the U.S. Treasury after paying out an annual dividend to our member banks throughout our district. We employ a thousand hard-working people in Dallas and several hundred more in our branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso. Each year, the Dallas Fed processes 1 billion paper checks worth about $900 billion, plus somewhere between 240 million and 300 million electronic checks. We handle 5.4 billion circulating banknotes each year worth nearly $92 billion. We continue to supply the liquidity our banking customers need in times of potential and real crises, such as Y2K, the aftermath of 9/11 and the devastating hurricanes in 2005. Our Dallas operation requires an underground vault the size of a five-story building—quite something, when you realize our vault was little more than an office safe in 1914. If you ever need to do your laundry or park at a meter, call me. Our vaults contain more than 150 million quarters.\n\nOur other responsibilities include supervising the banking industry within the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and stability. We have public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community and host many public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy. And we maintain a first-rate research department that provides me with the authoritative economic analysis I need for my role on the FOMC.\n\nI mean it when I say first-rate. Some of you may not know that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team for the past 14 years, won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2004. He teams up with a formidable research staff headed by Harvey Rosenblum, another Fed stalwart who, 46 years ago, also received a scholarship from a Rotary Club that made a huge difference in his education.\n\nIn short, I think you can be proud of the Dallas Fed. Like Paul Harris, George Dealey had a vision. That vision has been more than realized.\n\nI think I’ll stop right there. I would be happy to take any questions you might have and, in the best tradition of Federal Reserve officials, do my utmost to avoid answering them.",
