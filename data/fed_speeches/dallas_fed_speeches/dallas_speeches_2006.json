        "content": "December 19, 2006 Longview, Texas\n\nI am delighted to be here today with a fine group of Rotarians. Before I went up to Washington to serve as the deputy U.S. trade representative, I was a member of the Downtown Dallas Rotary. I enjoyed the camaraderie and sense of purpose that the Dallas Rotary shares with Rotarians here in Longview and everywhere. The vision Paul Harris had in 1905 is one of lasting influence, and I can’t think of a nicer group of solid, patriotic citizens to have lunch with on the Tuesday before Christmas.\n\nAs I left the house this morning, my wife, Nancy, said: “Now don’t you go spoil those nice people from Longview’s holiday by talking economics. You know, Richard, it is not for nothing that they call it ‘the dismal science,’ and no one wants to hear dismal stuff at this happy time of year.”\n\nWell, this bothered me driving all the way here. Then I remembered a tale one of the wittiest of the Federal Reserve’s economists, David Stockton, told last week. It seems a bachelor who thought himself in tip-top physical form was called in by his doctor. “My friend,” the doctor said, “I have just read your lab tests from your physical, and I have very bad news. You have a horrible disease for which there is no known medical cure. I suggest that you marry an economist and move to Arkansas.”\n\n“Geez, that’s awful,” the man said. “Are you telling me that settling down with an economist in Arkansas will help me live longer?”\n\n“No,” the doctor said, “but it will seem longer.”\n\nSo as to not dispense too much dismal science today, I thought I would limit myself to a brief brief on the economy to leave plenty of time to answer questions.\n\nAs usual, I will speak today only for myself and the Dallas Federal Reserve, not for any other members of the Federal Open Market Committee or for the rest of the System. So what you are going to get today is just one man’s opinion.\n\nHere is the bottom line. The economy is sending mixed signals. The bad news is that the housing industry is undergoing a sharp correction that may not have run its full course and auto production is more anemic than desirable. The not-so-good news is that expansion of manufacturing activity and things made in factories has shown signs of slowing, but—and this is important—from high levels of activity. As one of my friends in manufacturing and industrial production likes to put it, \"We are not stepping on the brakes, just lightening our foot from the accelerator.\"\n\nThe good news is that the dampening effect of the housing and auto sectors and the slowdown in manufacturing activity have been offset by continued growth in the service sector.\n\nNow I am going to lay a little dismal science on you.\n\nAmerica has about 144 million workers, producing over $13 trillion in output. Our workers produce more output than the combined total of the next four largest economies, which are Japan, Germany, China and the United Kingdom. When you sit down with your family over the holidays, you can feel good about what American brawn and brains produce.\n\nAnd you can be proud of being Texans. Our state alone produces more than Korea or Brazil or Mexico. Here is a fact that will startle you: We Texans produce 25 percent more output, measured in dollar terms, than all of India. That’s just the production of 10 million workers in one state alone. We are blessed to live in a mighty big country with a whopping big, growing economy.\n\nHow do we do it? What are the dynamics of that mighty economic machine we know as America? How do we keep growing when we hear about the downturn in housing and the woes of our auto industry, or when the papers tell you that China and others are taking away our manufacturing business?\n\nWell, first you have to understand that the United States is no longer just a manufacturing economy. In fact, it hasn’t been a manufacturing economy for quite some time, just as we have not been an agricultural economy for an even longer period of time. This is not to say that the United States is not an agricultural or a manufacturing powerhouse. We very much are. But these sectors have less and less impact on our well-being as we continue our inexorable climb up the value-added ladder.\n\nAgriculture employs only 1 percent of our workers and accounts for only 1 percent of our gross domestic product. Manufacturing employs 10 percent of our workers and contributes 12 percent of our output. If you add those numbers to the contribution of utilities, mining, and oil and gas and construction activity, you will account for 25 million workers and $2.7 trillion in output. In other words, the goods-producing sectors of our economy employ a sixth of our workers and produce a little less than one quarter of our output.\n\nKeep this in mind as you read in the press or hear on the radio and television that the markets went into spasms after this or that index of manufacturing activity—the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index or the Empire State Index or the Dallas Fed’s newer manufacturing index—was released, or when dour economists report on declining auto production. Certainly these indicators matter and are taken seriously, particularly by the families whose incomes depend on work in those sectors of the economy.\n\nBut in trying to divine the course of the whole U.S. economy, remember that, for example, about 1.1 million people work in motor vehicle manufacturing in this country, producing eight-tenths of one percent of our GDP. The legal services industry, in contrast, employs 1.2 million people who collectively contribute 1.5 percent of our GDP. I am tempted to make a lawyer joke here—God knows there are plenty of them (both lawyers and jokes)—but it is not a laughing matter to economists. The legal services industry provides as many jobs as the auto manufacturing industry and contributes almost twice as much to our economic output.\n\nIn contemplating the course of the economy, we need to look beyond manufacturing and consider where the other five-sixths of our workers work. Where do we produce over three quarters of our $13 trillion in output?\n\nThe answer is in the service sector. We have almost 120 million people producing over $10 trillion in output working in law firms and hospitals and restaurants and offices and classrooms and laboratories and sales rooms. From the medical complexes in Houston and Dallas to the biotech labs of Boston, from the trading floors of Wall Street to the government offices in Washington, from the retail stores in Miami to the entertainment emporiums of Las Vegas, from the universities in California to the software salons of Seattle. As our society has progressed, we have moved up the value-added ladder toward what Winston Churchill once called the “superfine processes” where the greatest profit is reaped and the quality of life is best; where we work more with our brains than with our backs.\n\nEconomists will point out that this is where America enjoys its comparative advantage. We have created a system that harnesses the greatest brain power in the world and the most nimble and flexible business culture on the planet. Our comparative advantage is at the nano and bio and techno and financial end of the economic spectrum, not at the part of the spectrum where we till fields or bend metal. As we have moved up to these higher rungs on the value-added ladder and positioned ourselves to master the “superfine processes,” others have taken our old place on the lower rungs of the ladder.\n\nFor example, Vietnam produces the second-largest robusta coffee crop in the world. They have a comparative advantage in that aspect of agriculture that we don’t have. China churns out all kinds of manufactured goods that they can produce more cheaply than we can. We employ over 100 million people to take these foreign inputs, as well as what we make here in the good ol' U.S.A., refine them, transport them, package them and sell what we make from them in order to grow our economy. This is the service sector, and it is the service sector that drives our economy.\n\nTo be honest, one of our problems is that we do not have very good data on the service sector. We have tons of data that tell us every squiggle and wiggle of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, but we do not have sufficient equivalent data on services. The dearth of data makes it hard to do what economists love to do: build models that accurately forecast economic growth. We still have a lot of useful indicators for identifying changes in the business cycle from back when manufacturing ruled the day, but we have yet to identify counterparts for an economy that is service-sector driven.\n\nThis is all just a long-winded way of saying that it is difficult to say with true precision just how the economy will close out this year in terms of growth and pace. My guess is that we are most likely going to finish the year at a pace that exceeds the gloomy forecasts making all the headlines lately. If you net the downdrafts from the housing and auto sectors against the tailwinds from other countries that are growing faster than the United States, then adjust for the updrafts of a dynamic service sector and thank your lucky stars for a warm start to winter and burgeoning oil and gas inventories that have softened energy prices, I wouldn’t be surprised if the economy proves to have grown at better than two percent, net of inflation, in the second half of this year, then picks up pace in 2007. This is not a forecast, mind you. There are risks out there that, should they come to pass, would result in slower growth. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, however, I think this is a reasonable expectation. At least, that’s how I see it from my perch at the Dallas Fed.\n\nOn the inflation front, the good news is inflationary pressures appear to have reached a stasis, despite the labor shortages in certain sectors—particularly in chemicals and petroleum industries and in functions requiring skilled and semiskilled workers. The bad news is that the stasis is at too high a level for party poopers like me who will have no choice but to advocate tightening monetary policy further if inflation does not ratchet downward.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we prefer to look at inflation through a prism called the Trimmed Mean PCE. I won’t bore you with the details of how it works, but I’ll tell you this: We had some encouraging news in September when the Trimmed Mean showed inflation had dropped down to 1.6 percent. Unfortunately, it rose back to 2.6 percent in October, close to where it had been nestling before the September drop. This uptick was partially caused by costs in that pesky service sector: medical services.\n\nWhen we analyzed all the items in the personal consumption expenditure basket from medical costs to the costs of restaurant meals, we noticed that the median inflation rate was running at 4 percent and that over 30 percent of the items in the basket had prices that were increasing at a rate of over 5 percent. Now, this was for October. The November numbers come out on Friday, so we will have to wait until then to see the latest movements. While we at the Dallas Fed are hopeful that the measures taken to raise the federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent will quell inflation and, very important, expectations about future inflation, we cannot yet say with conviction that we have turned the corner and have this problem fully contained.\n\nGiven all of this, I would have to say that the risk of unacceptably high inflation still outweighs the risk of substandard economic growth.\n\nNonetheless, I think we are ending the year in pretty good shape. I do not agree with pundits who argue about whether we can engineer a “soft landing.” “Landing” implies stopping. I prefer to say that the Fed’s job is to provide the monetary conditions necessary to pilot our economy at a comfortable cruising altitude and speed while preventing the engine from overheating with inflation. As we look to 2007, I consider this objective to be within reach. And that, good Rotarians, would be far from a dismal outcome. You needn’t marry an economist and move to Arkansas. You can stay right here in Longview and thrive."

        "content": "November 20, 2006 Berlin, Germany\n\nI have known and admired Norbert Walter for a very long time. And I have known and admired Germany even longer. I have come to Germany countless times over the past 30 years, but what Norbert forgot to say in his overly kind introduction is that this is the first journey I have made here as a central banker.\n\nBeing a central banker makes it especially difficult for me to provide what has been requested of me by the American Academy: an updated examination of Germany’s economic health—its physiology and some of its pathologies. To speak as a central banker in any German forum is daunting. No representative of the Federal Reserve can claim anything but admiration for the way the FRG’s Bundesbank managed its affairs in the pre-euro days of the Deutsche mark. The pernicious effect of inflation was well understood by the Bundesbank when it dominated the European economic landscape.\n\nFrom its creation on June 21, 1948, until its retirement on December 31, 1998, the DM retained its value better than any other major currency. Over the 50-year lifespan of the DM, consumer prices in Germany increased about fourfold. Over the same period in the United States, consumer prices increased about sevenfold, in significant part due to the laxity of the 1970s, before a grandson of German immigrants, Paul Volcker, restored discipline over monetary policy. The Bundesbank’s legacy has been solidly imbued in the European Central Bank. Any central banker anywhere in the world is grateful for Germany as the exemplar of monetary probity. I certainly am.\n\nBut I do not appear here before the American Academy in my capacity as CEO of the Federal Reserve’s Eleventh District. I am here solely as a friend of Germany, having been asked to revisit a speech I gave before the Atlantik-Brücke’s annual meeting in June of 2004, well before I joined the Federal Reserve. The title of that speech was “Can Germany Hold Its Own in the New World of a Reconfigured Europe, An Ascendant China, and 21st Century America?”\n\nThe answer I gave to that question almost two and a half years ago, when I was a private citizen, was an unqualified “no.” Not at the time I delivered that speech. The question today is: has anything changed?\n\nFirst, I want to firmly state that I am not in any way, shape or form speaking today as a representative of the Federal Reserve. It is standard practice for all Federal Reserve officials, save the Chairman on only two annual occasions, to state that when we speak in public, we speak only for ourselves, offering only our own personal views. I often imagine a collective “amen” follows this prudent disclaimer, especially in my case on those many occasions when I have spoken about monetary policy and the course of the U.S. economy! I want to especially underscore that disclaimer today. This is very much a personal speech.\n\nI did not assume my post at the Fed until April of 2005. I was first introduced to Germany in the spring of 1976. My introduction to Germany came from Jack McCloy via my mentor, Robert Roosa. McCloy taught me that “Germany is the heart of Europe. It is the backbone of the European economy. No country is more important than Germany to the United States.” And he went on to say that “Our alliance with Germany needs close attention, nurturing and vigilance…because its strength embodies profound advantages, while its weakness could involve far-reaching dangers and risks.”\n\nI took that advice to heart and have pursued an affectionate interest in Germany ever since meeting that truly great man. Jack McCloy’s words ring as true today as they did then.\n\nMcCloy and Roosa and another mentor, Michael Blumenthal, set in motion a series of opportunities that have allowed me to meet and follow, up close, the work of Helmut Schmidt and Helmut Kohl, seminal ministers like Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Otto Graf Lambsdorff, iconic Bundesbankers such as Otmar Emminger and Carl Otto Pöhl, and presidents von Weizsäcker and Carstens and Köhler. Over the years, many patient friends and German public servants, ranging from Walther Kiep to Matthias Wissmann to Wolfgang Ischinger, and too many business and academic and civic leaders to enumerate, all have spent countless hours trying to teach me Germany. As has my daughter Texana, a German studies concentrator at Harvard. I reviewed my long history with Germany in 2004 at the Atlantik-Brücke. I recount it now in summary form not to boast of my good fortune or to drop vintage German names, but to make clear that for almost 30 years I have done my level best to study and understand this country. My interest in Germany’s destiny could not be more sincere.\n\nI delivered that speech when I was vice chair of Kissinger McLarty, well before I joined the Fed. In it, I made some pretty undiplomatic but heartfelt statements about Germany. Specifically, I argued that Germany, in 2004, was “so weakened economically and so riddled with outdated operating methods that it threatens the prosperity of Europe, the Euro-Atlantic alliance and the global balance of economic power.”\n\nThat was pretty stern stuff.\n\nHere are some of the more pungent points I made in that speech two years ago, which drew upon the work of Professor Stephen Silva at the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, an institute I had the pleasure of helping launch:\n\nTo wrap up that rather mild list of concerns, I cited the then bestseller entitled Das Methusalem-Komplott to suggest that Germany might well replace Florida as “God’s antechamber,” so worrisome are your demographics.\n\nAnd then I concluded with evangelical fervor a quotation from the Book of Peter in the Bible: “Come, be serious and discipline yourselves.”\n\nAs my daughter Texana would put it: “Mein Gott Papa, kannst du bitte mehr direkt sein?—couldn’t you be just a little more blunt?” But I am pleased to report that the members of the Atlantik-Brücke and their tolerant guests at dinner that night cordially refrained from pelting me with their bread rolls. Their lack of outrage, more than anything else, convinced me that my words had struck a nerve. I had spoken frankly as a friend and admirer of Germany, and I believe now, as I did then, that I was spot on.\n\nThat was then. This is now. Upon rereading that speech to prepare for tonight, I was reminded of Berndt von Staden, the first German ambassador to Washington I had the pleasure to meet. He would later describe how Jimmy Carter dispatched his vice president and another aide to Bonn to convince Helmut Schmidt “to do his part to revive the…sagging world economy…” With wry criticism, von Staden later wrote: “I watched as the two gifted, youthful-looking gentlemen gave economic and fiscal advice to the very chancellor who had led his country through the energy and currency crises like no other had.”\n\nI am not gifted. And I am certainly not youthful looking. I am tremendously sympathetic to the task that lies before the chancellor as she seeks to lead Germany through a historic crisis of another sort. And, having not been dispatched by anybody in Washington or by the Federal Reserve, I do not think it is my place to give advice to the German chancellor or any other German leader, for that matter.\n\nI can, however, offer a cataloging of the prevailing criticisms I have read and heard about in tracking Germany’s efforts to overcome the problems I enumerated in 2004. The chancellor (and, to be fair, her predecessor, although perhaps too late in his tenure) has sought to initiate change, but still there has been no shortage of critiques in the public domain, even though most would agree that the German economy has recently undergone a fundamental improvement.\n\nCritics argue, for example, that in reality, the economy is only reflecting the benefits of a cyclical global upswing. These critics also argue that German industry’s role as Exportweltmeister, even with the headwind of a strong euro, masks deep-seated problems. Some say that Germany’s increased export performance stems largely from restrained wage growth relative to its European competitors rather than from improved productivity. This leads one to wonder how much more successful Germany would be in export markets if significant supply-side reforms were implemented.\n\nThe critics argue that recent corporate tax proposals will only modestly reduce Germany’s tax disadvantage relative to its competitors. They point out that, on the whole, your private sector is undercapitalized and overtaxed.\n\nThe skeptics maintain that too many product markets remain too highly regulated and that regulation and high barriers to entry continue to suffocate growth;\n\nThat the service sector remains underdeveloped.\n\nAnd, they argue that Germany has yet to find a way to harness the virtues of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction,” a process vital to moving any economy up the value-added ladder toward greater prosperity.\n\nThey warn that Germany’s social welfare system rewards leisure, complacency and underinvestment, not productivity and risk taking.\n\nThey say that recent incremental changes in labor laws are far from sufficient.\n\nThey argue that flotation of the Landesbanken HSH Nordbank and the forced sale of Berliner Sparkasse, while encouraging, do not provide reassurance that—other than at the behest of Brussels—Germany’s political leaders understand that state-owned banks are a hindrance to economic progress.\n\nThey maintain that the scrapping of the 50-year-old Ladenschlussgesetz in Berlin does not guarantee that the 16 Länder will take adequate advantage of the June reforms to your country’s federal system—especially Bavaria!\n\nCritics say the new healthcare proposals fail to sever the link between healthcare costs and wages, barely increase competition among healthcare suppliers and indeed risk making matters worse because, these critics argue, they expand the power of the state when precisely the opposite is needed.\n\nOthers worry about the challenges facing education and argue that charging tuition and board and making admissions procedures more selective are necessary but insufficient beginnings to educational reform. The recent initiatives taken to grant autonomy on courses and professorships in North Rhine-Westphalia and the gifts by Klaus Jacobs and Otto Beisheim, exemplary as they are, are, according to critics, not enough to overcome poor teaching quality and low rankings among global universities.\n\nThey argue that the bureaucratization of elementary and secondary schools does far more damage to German children than the relentless television barrage of SpongeBob Schwammkopf in undermining the German education system, once the standard for the world.\n\nTo illustrate the consequences of failing to advance education, detractors note your continued slippage in rankings put out by the World Intellectual Property Organization. They note that you currently rank sixth in WIPO’s rankings and have been surpassed by China in patent applications. And that, according to the Financial Times of October 30, 2006, “Germany is the worst performer among the larger European countries with a [bare] 2% R&D increase last year.”\n\nCritics point to recent studies by the International Institute for Management Development on labor market rigidity and disincentives to work to illustrate their concerns about Germany’s labor market. They note that Germany ranked dead last among 60 nations in the IIMD’s combined score, below France, Sweden, Brazil and Argentina.\n\nOther critics open up the recent issue of Foreign Policy magazine and note that Germany ranks 18th out of 20 countries in the globalization index compiled by A.T. Kearney and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That puts Germany behind Norway, Israel, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, and only slightly ahead of Malaysia and Hungary. These researchers cite Germany’s low marks in economic integration, a paucity of foreign direct investment and middling internet connectivity as factors in the country’s low ranking.\n\nAgainst this background of concerns, there is, of course, constant comment about the capability of German government officials to lead. I need not review those arguments for you. For here in Germany, just as in the United States, questioning leadership has become a blood sport.\n\nAs a central banker, I prefer to steer clear of raw political sparring. Even so, the harsh tenor of criticisms tossed about by your elected leaders—between parties and even within parties—is strikingly shrill and worrisome.\n\nIn the end, just as there are doubts about America, there are significant uncertainties about Germany’s ability to adjust to the newly reconfigured world.\n\nSo, has anything changed since that 2004 speech? I would say that much progress has been made since my comments to the Atlantik-Brücke and that, despite the criticisms enumerated above, I am encouraged.\n\nWere I asked what needs to be done next, my reply would echo any concerned friend of Germany: that everyone in this country, from the Facharbeiter to the Kundenberater to the Vorstandsmitglied, must seize the opportunities presented by recent reforms and by the improving business cycle to help Germany prosper anew.\n\nThere is no denying significant efforts have been undertaken to overcome the inertia of the German economy I described so graphically in 2004. But the work of adapting to a changing world is never done. Globalization is an inexorable force. Nicholas Sarkosy of France said it best just two weeks ago. “It would be as pointless to deny [globalization] or oppose it as to challenge the law of gravity or to stop the movement of the clouds.”\n\nGermany has embarked upon what is certain to be a long and difficult journey to secure its future in a tough, competitive, globalized world. Success will require the kind of determination that was the hallmark of the Bundesbank during the postwar period. And just as the Bundesbank charted the best course to navigate a treacherous world, the German private and public sectors must again become exemplars of how to successfully navigate a globalized one.\n\nTo wrap up, I am going to do something that I believe no other American speaker would dare do. I am going to quote Calvin Coolidge! Those who know American history know that President Coolidge didn’t say much, but when he did speak, he said a great deal. “Nothing in this world,” Coolidge said, “can take the place of persistence…Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan ‘press on’ has solved, and always will solve, the problems of the human race.”\n\nPersistence in pursuing economic reform will solve the problems that threaten Germany’s future. Germany must “press on” with needed reforms to its laws and to its attitudes toward competition and the pursuit of excellence.\n\nAnd so I conclude with a modified exhortation from my evangelical 2004 speech: Come, be serious and discipline yourselves. For the sake of Europe, the Atlantic Alliance and the world. For your sake. And ours. Press on. There is still much to do.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "November 17, 2006 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\n\nThank you, Herr Muller. I am grateful to be here. I am especially grateful to see Graf Lambsdorf sitting up there in the balcony. I have known and admired Graf Lambsdorf since 1978. He is an icon in postwar German economic history. Otto, with you looking now over my right shoulder, I will have to be especially measured in what I say. And, before I begin, let me point out that I am not speaking on behalf of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee. Today, as always, I speak only for myself.\n\nThe question posed by Herr Muller was: “Traditionally the U.S. dollar has been the major reserve currency and the first choice when it comes to issue bonds. Is this strong position of the dollar at risk due to the euro?”\n\nThe U.S. dollar has long played the role of the world’s premier international currency. It replaced the British pound in this role and has enjoyed a near monopoly for several decades. The creation of the euro fundamentally changed things. The question is: will the euro eventually match or surpass the dollar as an international currency?\n\nTo start answering that question we need to consider the factors that determine whether a currency is used extensively beyond the borders of the country—or, in the case of the euro, the group of countries that issue it.\n\nProbably the single most important factor determining whether a currency will play an important international role is the extent to which private agents perceive the currency as being a stable abode of purchasing power. That is, are investors and other market participants confident that the currency will retain its value over time so that it can serve as a store of value?\n\nThe ultimate determinant of the long-run value of a currency is the monetary policy pursued by the central bank that issues it—the Federal Reserve System in the case of the dollar and the European Central Bank in the case of the euro. In the postwar period, the Fed has done a good job as guardian of the value of the dollar, though perhaps we could have done a better job during the 1970s.\n\nThe dollar is viewed as a “hard currency,” as was the Deutsche mark during its lifetime, due to the policies of the Bundesbank. From its creation on June 21, 1948, until its retirement on December 31, 1998, the DM retained its value better than any other major currency.\n\nOver the lifetime of the DM, consumer prices in Germany increased fourfold. Over the same period, U.S. consumer prices increased about sevenfold! Most of the difference stems from the different performance of the Fed and the Bundesbank during the Great Inflation of the1970s. Yet both currencies are viewed as strong currencies because the performance of other central banks was so much worse.\n\nWriting more than two and a half centuries ago, one of our nation’s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin, noted, “He that kills a breeding sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown”—a dollar—“destroys all that it might have produced.” The pernicious effect of inflation on economic activity was well understood by the Bundesbank when it dominated the European monetary landscape, and it is well understood by the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) today. Indeed, the experience of the 1970s has taught many central banks the importance of remaining focused on long-term price stability.\n\nThe extent to which a country is actively engaged in international trade and finance is of comparable importance in determining whether the country’s currency is used internationally. Specifically, open, deep, broad and dynamic financial markets are key to ensuring that the currency can be used to engage in financial transactions at low cost. Open financial markets usually go hand in hand with active involvement in world trade. Students of history know that both the Dutch guilder and the British pound have played an important role as international currencies at times in the past when these countries were major trading nations with global reach comparable to that of the United States today.\n\nAnd finally, the economic size of a country will also be important. A country that is economically large will have a large natural constituency for its currency and will find it easier to shift currency risk to its trading partners by requiring that trade be denominated in its own currency. It is not just the current economic size of a country that matters—the country’s long-term growth prospects will also play an important role in determining the international use of its currency.\n\nGermany possessed many of the characteristics needed to make the DM an international currency, and the DM was second only to the dollar in international importance before being replaced by the euro in 1999. We have already noted the remarkable job the Bundesbank did at preserving the purchasing power of the DM during its lifetime. By the 1960s, Germany was the third largest economy in the world and, for much of the postwar period, one of the most dynamic. German capital markets were relatively open and liquid, and Germany’s exporters had a global presence.\n\nBut the DM was never likely to displace the dollar in international transactions. Germany was never more than one quarter the economic size of the U.S., measured in terms of GDP in constant purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars, even after reunification. And this factor was probably key to limiting the role of the DM in international transactions. The DM was widely used within Europe and in neighboring countries and played a pivotal role in anchoring the monetary policies of other central banks prior to economic and monetary union (EMU). A significant proportion of the stock of DM banknotes circulated outside of Germany, by some estimates as much as 30 to 40 percent. But this was limited to countries adjacent to the DM area. Despite the global reach of German exporters, the DM never attained the same standing as an international currency as the dollar.\n\nThe creation of EMU in 1999 and the launch of the euro fundamentally changed things.\n\nIn economic size, the euro area and the U.S. are quite similar. In terms of population, the euro area is larger than the U.S., which just recently passed the 300 million mark. The U.S. accounts for about 20 percent of global output, while the euro area accounts for about 15 percent. The euro area is more engaged in world trade than the U.S., according to conventional measures, exporting about twice as much as a share of GDP as does the U.S., while the U.S. is a bigger recipient of international flows of labor and capital.\n\nThe guardian of the euro’s value, the ECB, has been given a strong mandate to pursue price stability. The ECB has defined price stability in the euro area as an annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) “below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term.” And in the short history of the euro, it has done a good job controlling inflation.\n\nSince the launch of the euro in January 1999, the average annual rate of inflation in the euro area has been just a bit above the 2 percent limit—2.1 percent, to be precise. Measured on a comparable basis, i.e., using the experimental HICP published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), inflation in the U.S. over the same period has been somewhat higher, at 2.6 percent.\n\nOf course, the FOMC tends to focus on a different price index in its deliberations, namely the so-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy but includes the cost of owner-occupied housing, an item that is conspicuously absent from the HICP. Measured on this basis, our performance looks a lot more like that of the ECB.\n\nBut rather than dwell on the arcana of price indices, let me just note that by any standard, the ECB has done a good job at safeguarding the value of the currency in its care, and in this sense has made the euro an attractive international currency. During its short life, the euro has retained its value just as well as the DM did over the half century of its existence.\n\nWhile the ECB has delivered a currency that retains its purchasing power at least as well as the dollar, there are at least three reasons why the euro is unlikely to displace the dollar as the dominant international currency in the near term.\n\nFirst, the growth prospects of the euro area.\n\nSecond, the uniqueness of EMU.\n\nThird, the benefits of incumbency.\n\nLet’s consider each of these in turn.\n\nGrowth Prospects\n\n\n\nBoth the U.S. and the euro area have experienced the same 1.2 percent average annual growth in employment since 1999, but real GDP has grown more rapidly in the U.S., due in part to more rapid productivity growth. Over the past decade, a significant productivity growth gap has emerged between the U.S. and the euro area. The gap has proved remarkably persistent and has led to calls for more deregulation of labor and product markets within the euro area. Hardly a month goes by without the ECB calling for structural reforms to raise the euro area’s structural growth rate. In 2000, the leaders of the European Union (EU) embraced the Lisbon Agenda with the objective of making the EU “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010.” I think it is fair to say that progress to date has been disappointing, and there continues to be remarkably little appetite for tackling the obvious problems, despite increased pressures from globalization.\n\nRecently, Consensus Economics polled private forecasters for their long-term projections of GDP growth and inflation over the next decade. The forecast was that U.S. real GDP would increase at an average annual rate of about 3.0 percent between now and 2016. The forecast for the euro area was about a percentage point less, reflecting both slower population growth and slower productivity growth. The projected decline in the working-age population of the euro area, and the repercussions this will have for the sustainability of public finances in many member countries, must surely be a source of concern.\n\nUniqueness of EMU\n\nThe second factor that may limit the speed of the euro’s adoption as an international currency has to do with the uniqueness of the monetary union. EMU is without doubt a truly unique undertaking. It is unprecedented for a group of nation states of such size to agree to share monetary sovereignty. There is no historical playbook that can be referred to when problems arise.\n\nThe institutional framework of monetary union—the European System of Central Banks—is modeled after the Bundesbank, which was, in turn, modeled after the Federal Reserve System, so in a sense the ESCB is a grandchild of the Fed! As I mentioned earlier, the Bundesbank did a remarkable job of preserving the purchasing power of the DM, and the structure of the ESCB along with its mandate for price stability and independence will help ensure that the euro is a strong currency.\n\nI have already noted that during its short life to date the euro has retained its purchasing power about as well as the DM did during its existence. Looking forward, the same forecasters who are so pessimistic about the euro area’s growth prospects over the next decade are relatively optimistic about its inflation prospects. They think that inflation in the U.S. will average 2.3 percent or so over the next decade, but only 1.9 percent in the euro area. Of course, some—or perhaps all—of this may simply reflect differences in the way we measure prices. The relevant point is that the forecasting community seems to believe the ECB’s commitment to price stability, and other measures of inflation expectations seem to bear this out.\n\nMany economists who have followed the process of European monetary integration have expressed concern that the euro is “a currency without a government,” and that there is no precedent for a monetary union that was not based on a political union. At one level, the less government involvement in money, the better. History has shown that countries with central banks that are independent of politics tend to deliver lower inflation with little or no cost in terms of output growth.\n\nOf course, this is not the sense in which some worry about the euro. While it is now generally accepted that central bank independence is the surest path to long-run price stability, this independence must be accompanied by central bank accountability. In the United States, the Federal Reserve enjoys considerable operational independence but is held accountable to the democratically elected representatives of the American people through regular reports to Congress. The ECB is likewise accountable to the European Parliament, but the perceived “democratic deficit” in European Union institutions raises questions in the minds of some whether this is enough. The European Parliament is viewed as subordinate to national parliaments. Not even a Texan would argue that U.S. state legislative bodies are superior to the U.S. Congress or the president!\n\nThe recent rejection of the constitutional treaty leaves one wondering what sort of political relationship will exist between the countries of the EU and the euro area in the future. Can a monetary union succeed and prosper without a full blown political union, or will the EU create a new model that will serve as a template for the 21st century, just as Europe gave the world the idea of the nation state with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648?\n\nBenefits of Incumbency\n\nEven if the euro area was as politically integrated as the United States, and was not confronted with the prospects of low productivity growth and an increased dependency ratio, the euro might still take some time to match or displace the dollar as the world’s primary international currency. The reason has to do with the benefits of incumbency in currency use.\n\nIn a world of fiat currencies, my willingness to accept a currency depends on my belief that others will accept it in turn. The dollar is widely used as an international medium of exchange because people know that if they accept dollars in exchange for goods or services, they will find it relatively easy to spend these dollars on other goods or services or invest them in dollar-denominated assets. A currency that is widely used will be more liquid than one that is not, and this liquidity will serve to enhance the attractiveness of the currency.\n\nDislodging an international currency from its preeminent role is difficult, but it has happened. The dollar displaced sterling as the world’s leading international currency during the interwar period. But economic theory and historical experience suggest that large shocks are required for such transitions to occur. In the case of the dollar and sterling, the large shocks were the two world wars and the Great Depression, along with the shift in the relative size of the economies of the U.S. and the UK.\n\nThe dollar is widely used as a transactions medium, as an invoicing currency and as a currency of issuance for international bonds. The euro has made some inroads in all of these areas—not least as a transactions medium, where the existence of €500 notes has enhanced the currency’s attractiveness relative to the dollar in the cash economy—but at nowhere near the pace that some analysts had predicted prior to the currency’s launch. I would expect the euro to continue to grow in importance as an international currency in coming years.\n\nThe benefits of incumbency in currency use are much like those in language use. English has now become the lingua franca of international business. English is widely used in European institutions, including the ECB, despite the fact that native English speakers are a small share of Europe’s population. It has become the second language of choice for non-native speakers and will likely remain so for some time to come.\n\nOne final observation on incumbency. Offsetting to some extent the benefits that come with incumbency is the desire for portfolio diversification. As the euro becomes established as a credible store of value, it will become increasingly attractive for international investors who want to diversify their portfolios and limit their exposure to dollars. Such diversification seems likely to occur gradually, and the option to diversify is surely a benefit to the world as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, when commenting on the likely fates of two faith-based, or fiat, currencies, it seems appropriate to quote from the Bible:\n\n“What has been is what will be,\nand what has been done is what will be done;\nthere is nothing new under the sun.”\n—Ecclesiastes 1:9\n\nWell, it turns out that there is something new under the sun: the euro.\n\nMany decades ago, a prominent international economist noted that the ability to create its own domestic money is the key financial distinction of a sovereign state. Some authors have termed this the “One Nation/One Money” myth. The creation of the euro and its spread beyond the borders of the euro area is but the most dramatic example of the so-called deterritorialization of money; the currency counterpart of the ongoing process of globalization that is fundamentally changing the economic landscape.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Financial Times, one of the pivotal figures in the early years of EMU, Otmar Issing, noted that the creation of the euro was “an extremely good thing” but that the new currency is “not yet on absolutely safe foundations.” There is no doubt that the creation of the euro has helped strengthen the single market within the EU, increasing price transparency and boosting trade. Many of the participating countries enjoy a degree of monetary stability that previously eluded them.\n\nBut challenges remain. The euro area countries are still separate political entities. Never before have several sovereign nations of such economic size surrendered their monetary independence to a supra-national institution and agreed to share sovereignty in such an important area. The euro is sailing into the future through uncharted waters, without the usual rudder of political unity.\n\nIn addition, the euro area faces significant structural and demographic impediments to long-term growth. While there is widespread recognition in policymaking circles that there are major problems, there has been remarkably little enthusiasm for fundamental reforms.\n\nAn eclipse of the dollar is very unlikely in the near term. Even so, the Fed must be ever vigilant in preserving the value of the dollar. As Keynes noted, building on Lenin’s famous remark about how best to destroy capitalism: “There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and it does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.”\n\nThe members of the FOMC understand this and are committed to price stability. Our counterparts at the ECB are equally committed to price stability. Two strong currencies with global reach are an unambiguous good for the world and make us all better off in the long run.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "November 2, 2006 New York\n\nI am grateful for your invitation to speak before the NYABE today. My dear friend of decades and director of research at the Dallas Fed, Harvey Rosenblum, was once the president of NABE and spoke to this fine assemblage of minds back in 2002. That speaks volumes about the quality and importance of this forum. It is an honor to appear before you.\n\nIn keeping with today's popular obsession with disclosing any and all personal faults to as large a public as possible, I have a confession to make: I am data dependent. I have developed a strong and growing addiction to ever more refined and pure economic data. Alas, the stuff I need to feed my habit is not available on the street. So I am here today to suggest to you that there might be a profitable market for clever economists to exploit.\n\nBefore I get into that, please allow me to issue two disclosures. First, the thoughts I am about to share with you are my own and not those of any other Federal Reserve official or of the Federal Open Market Committee. Second, I am not a trained economist and make no pretense whatsoever of being a formal practitioner of the dismal science. To me, \"dismal\" is a misnomer; economics is a vibrant and exciting field of study, especially in a capitalist society where it best applies itself to the conundrums of capital markets and the intricacies of monetary policy.\n\nI came to economics and the markets late in life. I started out as a midshipman at the Naval Academy, then migrated from learning to navigate the seas to navigating through the undergraduate basics of economics at Harvard. After a brief detour to Oxford—principally to find my wife and perfect my taste for good beer—it was onward to Stanford Business School, where I discovered what has become a lifelong passion, with its own branch of economics: decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty.\n\nFor over a decade before I took up public service in 1997, I was able to profit from that passion as a hedge fund manager. Back in those days, the investors in funds actually made more than the managers of those funds—imagine that! Now I have the responsibility to apply what I have learned over the years in a different context—the making of monetary policy.\n\nSuccessful hedge fund managers and effective central bankers share at least one trait: They abide by what I refer to as \"the Gretzky principle.\" Hockey's Great One, Wayne Gretzky, once proclaimed, \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.\" It seems to me that success, whether for central bankers, hedge fund managers or business economists, comes with anticipating what comes next and acting decisively to be positioned for where the economic \"puck\" is likely to go.\n\nTo apply the Gretzky principle, good judgment, not a small amount of good luck and good data are needed.\n\nGood judgment certainly characterizes the men and women I have the honor of serving beside on the FOMC. For today's purposes, I want to duly note their good judgment, politely brush aside luck—we will always take as much as the monetary gods are willing to grant us—and focus on an essential element in the art of making fruitful decisions in an uncertain world: good data.\n\nI hardly need to explain the importance of good data to any of you. We all know the consequences of data being wrong or arriving too late. Our reputations rest on the data we use. The better the data, the less our uncertainty. And the less our uncertainty, the better our ability to make sound decisions.\n\nWithout a doubt, both the quantity and quality of the data I review now as a Fed bank president and FOMC participant are far beyond what I had access to in the past. The Fed's data resources are unmatched, as is the interpretation of that data offered by the exceptional minds of its regional and Washington research staffs. Yet one can never be satisfied. As good as the data are, they are never good enough. We have a great deal of accounting and analytical work left to do as we seek to refine our ability to make monetary policy in an increasingly complex world.\n\nLet me give you some examples of data inadequacy.\n\nTo begin with, most economic data are inherently backward looking, often to a disconcerting degree. Obviously, there is no way around this. Obtaining completely accurate forward-looking data would require extensive investment and research into that other dismal science, science fiction. Yet time-travel aside, we must strive to develop reliable real-time data collection technologies and ever more practicable models based on the limited framework of historical observations. That process is ongoing. To paraphrase singer–songwriter Robert Earl Keen, the road goes on forever and the analytical party never ends.\n\nThis is not to suggest that simply developing more enhanced models using available data is all that is needed for us to do our job better. In a rapidly changing world where microeconomic operators, enabled by expanding economic geography and technological innovation, are constantly pushing the envelope of production and profits, one can never be confident in the insights provided by even the most sophisticated econometric models.\n\nEach month, as I prepare for an FOMC meeting, I spend a great deal of time talking with CEOs and CFOs of companies to gather their impressions of the current state of the economy. To prepare for this last FOMC meeting, for example, I spoke to the leaders of companies whose annual revenues aggregated to a little over $1 trillion and whose operating income easily exceeded $110 billion last year. In these monthly interviews, I ask about activity and trends in their businesses and what they see happening with their production lines, customer bases and competitors in hopes of gaining insight into current growth and inflation dynamics in the economy. Recognizing the limits and risks of anecdotal evidence, even coming from the most disciplined and experienced corporate operators, I personally find this an effective way to bridge the gap between what our economic models tell us—based as they are upon historical data and various theoretical assumptions about the future—and what is happening in the real economy.\n\nDuring these conversations, I usually hear a keyboard clicking away in the background as these CEOs and CFOs punch in a few commands in response to my inquiries. And presto, accurate data emerge from their desktops about new orders, inventory levels, capacity utilization, input prices and a slew of other indicators that are minutes—not months—old.\n\nTo be sure, the ubiquitous nature of the data available to today's business operators raises the risk of drowning in information as they search for knowledge. Nevertheless, a significant disconnect persists between the instant and accurate data available to the hands-on operators in the economy and the inadequate and delayed data our macroeconomists are given to contemplate.\n\nI do not envy the statisticians charged with tracking the U.S. economy. We are a behemoth—$13 trillion in GDP, 300 million mouths to feed, 140 million workers, billions of transactions on any given day. But working with incomplete and belated information limits our ability to \"skate ahead of the puck.\" For example, the service sector now represents 70 percent of the U.S. economy, yet we remain incapable of forecasting with service-sector data because such data do not exist. When I was a deputy U.S. trade representative, I could access reliable and nearly immediate data on trade in goods, while the latest services trade data would be up to a year old. Unfortunately, the services trade data represent only a smidgeon of the total impact services have on our economy.\n\nA good central banker knows how costly imperfect data can be for the economy. This is especially true of inflation data. In late 2002 and early 2003, for example, core PCE measurements were indicating inflation rates that were crossing below the 1 percent \"lower boundary.\" At the time, the economy was expanding in fits and starts. Given the incidence of negative shocks during the prior two years, the Fed was worried about the economy's ability to withstand another one. Determined to get growth going in this potentially deflationary environment, the FOMC adopted an easy policy and promised to keep rates low. A couple of years later, however, after the inflation numbers had undergone a few revisions, we learned that inflation had actually been a half point higher than first thought.\n\nIn retrospect, the real fed funds rate turned out to be lower than what was deemed appropriate at the time and was held lower longer that it should have been. In this case, poor data led to a policy action that amplified speculative activity in the housing and other markets. Today, as anybody not from the former planet of Pluto knows, the housing market is undergoing a substantial correction and inflicting real costs to millions of homeowners across the country. It is complicating the task of achieving our monetary objective of creating the conditions for sustainable non-inflationary growth.\n\nWhen we consider the potential consequences of poor or incomplete data leading to suboptimal policy, central bankers must be, by necessity, knights errant of sorts, searching for the Holy Grail of economic data that is both timely and accurate.\n\nIn this regard, I want to brag on my team at the Dallas Fed for a minute. The Dallas Fed has had some success at making our region's data more timely and accurate, a significant feat when you consider that Texas is the second most populous state, has the fastest growing manufacturing base in the country, grew its real output at a 9 percent rate in the first quarter, leads the nation in exports and boasts an economic machine larger than Korea or Brazil or Mexico and 25 percent larger than India in dollar terms.\n\nOne area of our staff's success is with employment data. In March of each year, job growth estimates through the preceding September are revised using unemployment insurance records. But these records are released quarterly, not just annually, so we take advantage of this fact to revise our estimates of Texas jobs on an accelerated schedule. In March 2005, for example, the initial release put job gains for the month at 10,600. When official revisions were released a year later, the public found out that many new jobs had not been counted and that the initially reported figure was less than half the 21,700 jobs that had actually been created. But this was something we at the Dallas Fed already knew. Five months earlier, in August 2005, our analysts had estimated that 17,000 jobs had been added in March. In other words, we anticipated much of the official revision well before it was released seven months later. Moreover, our analysts devised a two-step procedure for seasonally adjusting official Texas employment data that was later adopted by the BLS. These procedures for refining existing data help explain why the Dallas Fed's jobs-growth forecasts consistently outperform those of other analysts for timeliness and accuracy.\n\nWe also have developed a measure of inflation that is, I believe, a better predictive tool for future price movements. The Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate that we calculate in Dallas looks at monthly price movements and sets aside those price categories that rose and fell most sharply, so that extreme swings in the prices of individual components do not distort our sense of the underlying trend. It does not automatically exclude food, energy or any particular set of items. For September, the most recent month available, our Trimmed Mean showed inflation running at an annualized rate of 1.7 percent, below the 2.1 percent annualized rate registered by the ex food and energy measure of core PCE inflation. For the past year—September 2005 to September 2006—the Trimmed Mean showed inflation running at 2.6 percent, slightly ahead of the ex food and energy measure of 2.4 percent.\n\nFrom my perspective, the Dallas Fed's Trimmed Mean measure is especially helpful because it is designed to forecast the underlying trend in overall consumer price inflation six months to a year ahead. From the numbers I just mentioned, I draw two conclusions. First the good news: It is possible that the trend in overall consumer inflation has peaked and is finally heading lower. Next, the not-so-good news: The overall inflation trend remains at a level above my comfort zone. I am encouraged by the change in direction of trend inflation, and I hope that in the future my CEO and CFO contacts will be telling me that the competitive forces of globalization have kept their pricing power limited or nonexistent.\n\nSo the good economists at the Dallas Fed are making progress.\n\nBut these are relatively simple accomplishments when we consider what is needed to maximize our analytical efficiency in a globalized, cyber-enhanced world. Even before we start to develop better measurement techniques to capture the influences of new economic entrants and technologies that continue accelerating at the pace of Moore's Law, we first need to ask some basic questions.\n\nBear with me as I present an analogy that might strike you as a bit over the top but will, I hope, ease us into a discussion of contemplating the vital data we may need to inform Federal Reserve policymaking in a dramatically changed world.\n\nSuppose I were to create from thin air an imaginary new currency to replace the U.S. dollar in my home state of Texas. Since the Canadians already have the loonie—I know how you New Yorkers look at Texans—let's just call this new Texas money the \"burrito.\"\n\nNow imagine Texas changed its relationship to the U.S. in no other way but for the creation of the new burrito and the establishment of an independent central bank with responsibility solely for Texas. The burrito would be backed by the full faith and credit of the government in Austin, and the Central Bank of Texas would have exactly the same mandate as the Federal Reserve, but only for the Texas economy.\n\nIn every other way, business would proceed as usual. No laws would change. We would stay connected as we are now to the world around us. We would have the same flows of goods, people, ideas and capital that we do today as part of the United States.\n\nHow would the Central Bank of Texas accomplish its mission? What economic indicators would we find useful in seeking to formulate a monetary policy designed to preserve the value of the burrito and the sustainability of Texas' economic growth? Would we look only within Texas' borders? Would our inflation rate policies differ significantly from those of the United States sans Texas? Would real Texas interest rates be fully independent of or highly influenced—or perhaps even determined—by U.S. rates? Would we need to take into account the monetary policy of the rest of the U.S. to determine our own proper monetary stimulus or restraint?\n\nOf course, we know that, as with any central bank, the hypothetical Central Bank of Texas would have the power to debase the burrito by printing too much of it or by maladministering the central bank's franchise. But, could we affect our employment and output, given our real and virtual connections to the U.S. and the world around us? If not, should we then just rewrite our central banking mandate to focus solely on prices? And even if we did, would we be able to make the variability in Texas' inflation, and the corresponding inflation risk premium, less than that of the United States? Or would the inflationary impulses of the U.S. condition the dynamics of Texas' inflation?\n\nNow, let's come back to the real world. Is it really possible to assume that like the fictional, independent Central Bank of Texas, the Federal Reserve can make monetary policy without taking into account capacity constraints, levels of resource utilization, global liquidity and other factors impacting price developments in the rest of the world? How do we know what our true potential growth is without properly accounting for the world's resource potential? How can we calculate our NAIRU without an accurate sense of workforce dynamics and price movements outside our geographic boundaries?\n\nYour gut-level answers to these questions may be similar to mine. I would venture that the Open Market Committee of a Texas central bank would pay quite a bit of attention to economic trends in the U.S. and the rest of the world. Reliance on Texas data and econometric models alone would be insufficient, perhaps even foolhardy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has an impressive assortment of highly sophisticated, regularly measured and accurate data to put into its existing domestic models. But I would argue that we need to supplement them with data that incorporate global trends. We cannot dismiss the worldwide resources that can be brought to bear to increase production and the aggregate supply of goods and services. These inputs dictate the level of competition in the marketplace. In the real world, developments in faraway places like China impact the ability here at home to grow employment and profits and to raise or lower prices. Just look at Ford Motor Co.'s recently announced plans to cut production costs by doubling its purchases of Chinese-made parts. Searching the globe for better, cheaper and faster inputs is a basic instinct of the millions of middle managers who run supply chains for countless U.S. businesses, large and small.\n\nSo what specific things might we want to look at? Luckily, we do not have to look very hard to find clues about the best answer to this question. Looking beyond borders, as you all know, is standard operating procedure for central banks all over the world, including our neighbors to the north.\n\nYou know the old saw about Canada being the vichyssoise of nations: cold, half-French and difficult to stir. Well, the Canadians are hardly stereotypical when it comes to making monetary policy. In addition to looking at essential domestic and international indicators—inflation, output gaps, GDP growth, terms of trade, commodity prices, exchange rates, international interest rates and so on—they begin their analysis and estimates of the future with an outlook for global GDP growth and global growth projections.\n\nCanada resembles the U.S. in openness to the world economy. But its economy is much smaller. Indeed, Canada's output in real dollars is only a little bit greater than Texas'. Economic theory supports the idea that small open economies like Canada's or Texas' have to look beyond their borders to understand inflationary pressures because they lack the heft to influence world prices and the capacity to be largely self-reliant. Small economies, so the theory goes, are price takers.\n\nBig economies like the U.S. are price makers, and in theory, international price developments follow our lead, thus relegating external developments to a lesser status. Yet the euro zone nations constitute an equally large economy. At the European Central Bank, the very first item reviewed in its regular Monthly Bulletin is \"The External Environment of the Euro Area.\" This consists of a review of real economic developments in the U.S., Japan and the non-euro-area OECD, as well as the U.K., other European countries, Latin America and Asia. Next, the ECB reviews developments in commodity markets and discusses the outlook for the external environment. Only after looking beyond their borders do they go into a very standard review of monetary and financial developments in the euro area and exchange rate and balance of payments indicators.\n\nHere we have a big economy and an influential central bank demonstrating the importance of monitoring external developments along with their domestic analysis. Maybe we can learn something from the ECB when it comes to working global economic developments into our deliberations.\n\nThis is not to say that the Federal Reserve doesn't do its level best to look beyond domestic economic indicators. We certainly do. Nor am I suggesting that the Federal Reserve does not ultimately have the power to control inflation in the United States. We have it well within our grasp to debase or enhance the value of our currency. But I would argue that international data deserve closer examination in order to understand the influences an integrated global economy has on our economy and our currency and the implications of that integration for our monetary policymaking. Last week, my counterpart at the New York Fed, Tim Geithner, put it this way: \"Integration does not, and should not, limit our ability to achieve our objectives. Rather, it forces us to think harder about how our economies are evolving and how developments in the rest of the world affect our markets.\" If this is so, we have to focus on how best to improve our collection and analysis of global data.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is undertaking a significant research effort to examine the issues I've addressed today and to answer many other questions globalization poses for the economy and for monetary policy. To guide our research on this front, we have put together an advisory board consisting of Martin Feldstein, John Taylor, Ken Rogoff, Glenn Hubbard and Nobel laureate Finn Kydland.\n\nI will tell you one thing we have already learned from our nascent work in Dallas and that is that we know less about the rest of the world than we think we do. To illustrate my point, consider that there is no reliable measurement of the capital stock of China. This handicaps any calculation of China's resource utilization and invalidates any measurement of China's \"output gap.\" In reality, we've no idea how much capacity exists should a gaggle of Fords seek to cut production costs by turning to Chinese parts suppliers.\n\nGlobalizing econometric models, though, could help us fly a little less blindly. To extend that metaphor, let's go back to my home base of Texas. When I get on an airplane to fly to speak to you here in New York, I put myself in the hands of that plane's pilots. To carry me to LaGuardia, they determine the best course to fly by accounting for headwinds, tailwinds, updrafts and downdrafts in order to aeronautically skate ahead of the puck and get us there on time and in one piece.\n\nGlobalization brings new influences into the Fed's navigation calculations to determine the best flight path for the U.S. economy. To determine that course—and to most efficiently and safely reach our mandated destination of sustained non-inflationary growth—we must develop a better understanding of the new forces exerting themselves on the aircraft we have been charged with flying. That aircraft no longer flies solely in domestic space, affected solely by domestic factors. Rather, it flies all over the world, requiring more sophisticated navigation instruments to monitor changing global and domestic economic conditions, enabling us to pilot the craft safely and efficiently.\n\nHerein lies the opportunity for enterprising economists, such as yourselves, to rise to the challenge I've presented here today and to profit from the development of that new, sophisticated navigation equipment. I hope you do.\n\nI realize many of you would prefer to discuss the more immediate outlook for the economy and for monetary policy. So I will stop here and do my best to not answer your questions.\n\nThank you."

Thank you, everybody. And thank you, especially, to the American Assembly. I am tremendously honored to receive the Service to Democracy Award and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Medal for public service.\n\nI particularly like the rosette, David. I’ll wear it with pride. It reminds me of those days when bankers used to wear their logos on their suit lapels, much as politicians wear American flag pins today. It was just part of the bankers’ uniform. Walter Wriston, a former recipient of this award for his service to the private sector and a man known to get his way, no questions asked, used to insist that every banker at Citicorp wear their logo pins on their lapels all day, every day, 24/7.\n\nThe story goes that one day, Wriston called his top team together for a meeting. He noticed John Reed wasn’t wearing his logo pin. Wriston said, “Where the (beep) is your pin?” There is a reason Reed succeeded Wriston. Without skipping a beat, John slapped his forehead and said, “Walt, I’m sorry. I forgot to take it off of my pajamas when I got up this morning.”\n\nIf I ever get to an age where I wear pajamas, David, I’ll be sure to wear this little guy [rosette] on them, too.\n\nBefore I say a few quick words, I want to add to Jim Hackett’s thanks to Gloria Brown—and the good folks here at the Collins Center and SMU—by thanking the two remarkable people who made that film. One is Kristen Jackson. Stand up, Kristen. Kristen is a bright, shining star on our Fed staff. She is incredibly dedicated to her work and is a perfectionist. I was told earlier that she spent countless hours of her own time making that film. Thank you, Kristen.\n\nI also want to thank James Hoard for helping her with the film. James, stand up. When we are out in public, James is constantly by my side. He always has a wide smile on his face and a great country boy’s sense of humor.\n\nThe other day, we stopped for a Dip Cone at a Dairy Queen in the little town of Bowie on our way to Wichita Falls, where I was giving a speech. We walked into a room full of farmers and ranchers in their bib overalls, iced tea glasses in hand, discussing hay prices and cows. Needless to say, all conversation at the DQ stopped as men wearing lace-up shoes, white shirts and neckties strode into their midst. The Federal Reserve or anything federal is hardly popular in the hardscrabble reaches of that part of Texas. I was just about to turn on my heels and head back to the car when James leaned over to me and whispered, “Don’t worry, Richard. Dressed as we are, they just think we’re Baptist preachers passing through town.”\n\nSeeing that picture in the South African veld of my mother as a little girl, taken shortly after her father died in the flu epidemic of 1918, really puts this evening into perspective—that image, and the fact that there are no pictures of my father before he was 20 or so because he had no family to take one (and the foster parents that occasionally took him in off the streets in Australia couldn’t have afforded a camera). Juxtapose that against those beautiful pictures with Nancy, of Anders with the first fish he caught, Alison’s sweet laughter, James in his Y-football uniform and Texana in my arms the night I got the good news/bad news that I had been nominated to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nIf you hold on to those images, then all the other events the film documents—all the meetings with presidents and heads of state and government; the trade negotiations with China and Vietnam and all the rest; the tête-à-têtes with Nelson Mandela and Alan Greenspan and even Dolly Parton (that photo is my favorite: It reminds me of Groucho Marx’s line in the movie At the Circus: “She had a smile men adore so, and a torso even more so”); sitting at the table of the Federal Open Market Committee—all those events, as wonderful as they were and are, pale in significance.\n\nWhatever it is that you think I have done right, whatever it is that the trustees of the American Assembly feel qualifies me for this honor, whatever it is that would lead good people like Ruth Altshuler and Jim Hackett and Steve Stamas and Dick Lugar to allege what they have alleged, would never have occurred if my parents hadn’t had the gumption to lift themselves up from nowhere and come to this promised land we call America so that I could eventually meet Nancy and be given the gift of four beautiful children. My family is the wellspring of my good fortune. They are my inspiration to “pay it back.”\n\nNot that I did not enjoy those hyperbolic words of praise from Ruth and Jim and Steve and the good senator. I am grateful for them. But I do think it is important to put them in context, especially in front of two truly praiseworthy Nobel laureates like Michael Brown and Joe Goldstein; a selfless patriot like Ross Perot; some of the most talented business leaders in the nation, like Ray Hunt (the magnificent chairman of our board at the Dallas Fed) and John Menzer and Jim Hackett and Mike Ullman and Mike Jordan; or truly gifted public servants like Senator Dick Lugar and Admiral Bob Inman; yet alone in front of my wife of 33 years and my children and my brother Mike and my mother-in-law, who know me so well, foibles and all.\n\nThis past Sunday, David Brooks of the New York Times provided his readers a sweet tribute to Adam Smith’s treatise on moral sentiments. Brooks paraphrased a couple of sentences Smith wrote 250 years ago that summarize how I feel about this moment: “We not only want to feel praise, we want to feel praiseworthy. We want to act in ways that deserve praise, if a wise, impartial spectator happened to be watching us. In our best moments, we want to live up to the ideals our society has gradually engraved upon us.” I pray that in my best moments I prove worthy of the ideals you have engraved upon me and upon this beautiful certificate.\n\nA Harvard classmate of mine wrote a poem titled “Guest of Honor” for our 35th reunion last summer. It includes the following lines:\n\nAfter President Turner concludes this ceremony and we head into the banquet room, I know what I will remember and cherish most about this wonderful evening: being in the company of friends and family and having them to sit next to. That fills me with a deep sense of gratitude. That alone encourages me and the good people I have worked with—and for—in government and at the Federal Reserve. To simply know that you and the American Assembly feel that I and my colleagues in public service have lived a life worth living and are doing good things worth continuing to do is the truest honor of all.\n\nThank you so much."

        "content": "October 10, 2006 London\n\nMy much-admired but spelling-impaired namesake, Stanley Fischer of the Bank of Israel, likes to remind audiences that there are three kinds of economists: those who can count and those who can’t. I am an M.B.A. and a former hedge fund manager, not a professionally trained economist. I rather like to count, particularly when the math is denominated in pounds or dollars, euros or yen, or even Mexican pesos or Canadian loonies. And yet, surrounded as I am today by an audience of the kind of hardball counters and financiers I used to be, I am going to speak about something less tangible, less measurable and of considerably less immediate profit potential. I want to talk about how globalization impacts the economy and particularly the framing of monetary policy in the United States.\n\nGlobalization has become one of today’s hot-button words. We’ve all developed a feel for what it is. Critics, particularly on the other side of the Channel, decry it for sullying national cultures and thwarting the independence of nations. Economists and thoughtful popular writers like Thomas Friedman use it to describe more felicitous aspects of the integration of the world economy. Businesswomen and men know it simply as an opportunity to enhance their resource base, lower the cost of goods sold, drive productivity and achieve new levels of efficiency in their endless pursuit of profit. And financiers consider it a vehicle for expanding opportunities to both mitigate risk and enhance returns.\n\nIn the broadest sense, globalization is like an economic ecosystem in which political and geographic boundaries no longer confine potential. Globalization promotes the movement of goods, services, workers, tasks, ideas and capital to wherever they are most highly valued and can work together most efficiently, flexibly and securely.\n\nWe tend to take globalization for granted at the operating level of the economic ecosystem. However, globalization poses many puzzles for macroeconomic theorists to solve, particularly as it impacts the making of monetary policy.\n\nA year ago this November 3, I had the honor of delivering the Manshel Lecture in American Foreign Policy at Harvard University. I preached about our need to update both the theory and practice of incorporating the inputs of an economically integrated, cyber-enhanced world into the analytical and judgmental tool kit used by the Fed’s monetary policy practitioners. Initially, my message was somewhat offensive to economic traditionalists. It rudely challenged the doxology that traces all econometric blessings to Phillips curves and domestic output gaps, and it questioned the liturgy of NAIRU and other tenets long considered gospel in the temples of American monetary policy. I posited that the standard GDP calculation—C + I + G + Net Exports—fails to fully capture the gearing of the U.S. economy in a globalized world. And I suggested that simply relying on exchange rates to mitigate the de- or dis- or inflationary impulses that result from globalization provides false comfort about a central bank’s independence from foreign influences.\n\nAt first, that sermon failed to move the congregation. But one brave soul was listening, and that was Janet Henry. Janet and her colleagues at HSBC read that lecture, thought about it and wrote a fine piece called “Gap-ology and Globalisation: Measuring the Global Output Gap.” Agnostically but respectfully, it raised some penetrating questions about the new gospel. Janet, you will be happy to know that your thoughtful essay led others to the chapel, if only to peek inside. You may remember that at Harvard, I mentioned that anybody who googled the pairing “globalization and monetary policy” would have gotten only 39 hits. If you did so this morning, you would have gotten 8,850. So we are gathering momentum, however slowly.\n\nToday, I plan to use your questions as a point of departure to ask still more questions. In doing so, I hope to illustrate how far we central bankers have yet to travel to become more effective monetary policymakers in today’s world. Before I get started, however, I must issue my usual disclaimer that I speak only for the view from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for the Federal Open Market Committee or for any of the other Bank presidents and governors on the committee. My words are my own.\n\nI expressed little original thinking on that pleasant evening at Harvard last fall. At the suggestion of my respected colleague at the Dallas Fed, the brilliant economist Michael Cox, I simply took my cue from one of the great minds of modern times, Joseph Schumpeter. The work of Schumpeter, a Harvard economics professor in the 1930s and 1940s, provided the essential framework for my initial efforts to understand the impact of globalization on the U.S. economy and its policy implications. In Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter outlined the idea of creative destruction: In a free enterprise system, our economic structures are constantly revolutionizing themselves from within, as new technologies, processes, ideas and markets rise and destroy the old.\n\nTo illustrate his point, Schumpeter used the example of the railroads in his seminal work, Business Cycles. Basically, his point was that as railroads reached new regions, they upset all the economic dynamics of physical location, costs and production functions that had existed in the area before, and he concluded that, as a result, “hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which [had] been optimal before remain so afterward.” That bears repeating: Hardly any of the dynamics of location, cost and production functions that had been optimal before remained so afterward. You know this viscerally here in England: Your forebears launched the Industrial Revolution and invented the locomotive, one of the most creatively destructive forces—short of Margaret Thatcher—that the world has ever known. You have lived with capitalism’s constant change longer than any other people. Creative destruction is part of your national DNA, just as it is part of ours in the United States.\n\nWe struggle to understand how globalization's structural changes alter the rules of thumb we look to as central bankers. China and India and the Internet and all the manifestations of globalization are collectively a Shumpeterian locomotive writ large. As instruments of creative destruction, globalization and the “net” influence business decisions, expand our productive capacities, increase competition, reconfigure the assignment of tasks and their execution, and influence the prices of labor, goods, services and capital. All of these forces, of course, ripple through the economy and change the economic landscape, so they should be of keen interest to central bankers. It is one thing, however, to theorize that globalization has significant consequences for the conduct of monetary policy—that is the easy part. It is quite another to know what the consequences are, how they work and how to measure them.\n\nIn U.S. monetary policymaking circles, we work with cost calculations, assumptions about production functions and formulae for policy optimization that were developed before the world economic map was redrawn by the entry of new players and new technologies that changed our “ways of doing things.” Consequently, the majority of the economic indicators we use to develop monetary policy today only look within our own borders. We measure domestic wages and incomes, domestic capacity utilization, domestic prices and domestic industrial activity. Where we do look beyond our border, we focus narrowly on foreign activity’s impact on our economy through trade and current account balances and relative currency values.\n\nWhat about global wages, global capacity utilization and global industrial activity? What about the reconfiguration of assignments and tasks within businesses that take place in cyberspace, enabled by the Internet and intranet? I submit that these nondomestic activities and trends are growing more important to our economic welfare and that they condition how we develop and frame monetary policy. Here is where Stanley Fischer’s three economists enter the picture: Fed economists can certainly count; in my view, better than anybody. But are they counting the right things?\n\nTo illustrate the point, let me briefly transport you to a hypothetical world where a nation that produces 25 percent more than India suddenly materializes within the borders of the United States. From 1836 to 1845, that nation had an embassy at 3 St. James’s Street; the oenophiles in the audience will know that address today as the site of Berry Bros. & Rudd. That nation was the Republic of Texas, which joined the United States in 1845 and, but for a brief digression into the Confederacy, kept its shoulder firmly to the wheel. By 2005, the state had grown to produce nearly $1 trillion in output, exceeding the production of Brazil or India or South Korea or Mexico.\n\nTexas is now the largest exporting source in the United States. The state is currently growing its employment at twice the U.S. rate. It produces $110 billion in manufactured goods and a healthy chunk of the nation’s agricultural output, but, like all advanced economies, it is driven predominately by services, which account for 60 percent of the Texas economy. So it is hardly ridiculous to think of Texas as one thinks of the so-called BRIC countries—except it is larger than all of them except China—for the purpose of an intellectual exercise. (One could, I suppose, replace the C in BRIC with a T and please our hosts by referring to the “BRIT” economies.)\n\nIndulge me for a moment here. Let’s suppose that this substantial economic machine we know as Texas changed its relationship to the U.S. in one and only one way: by establishing its own free-floating currency and independent central bank with the same mission as the Fed—except just for Texas. I know what some of you are thinking: The loonie is already spoken for, so let’s call our imaginary Texas currency the “burrito” and back it with the full faith and credit of the government in Austin, a government, incidentally, that is currently running a budget surplus.\n\nThe Central Bank of Texas would have exactly the same mandate as the Federal Reserve, to wit: “to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.” But only in Texas.\n\nIn every other way, business would proceed as usual, and nothing else would change. We would stay connected as we are now to the world around us. We would have the same flows of goods, people, ideas and investment capital that we do today as part of the United States. We would have the same interstate banking structure—that is, the big national and global banks and financial institutions that currently dominate our banking industry in Texas would continue to operate in the same way. We would have the same corporate headquarters—from Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to American Airlines, Dell, AT&T and Frito-Lay. Our housing market would retain the same access it has today to mortgage market lenders. We would have the same laws as before. We would communicate through the same mobile and fixed-line systems and maintain all our interconnections with the rest of the world. Only the currency and central bank would change.\n\nNow, ask yourself how the Central Bank of Texas would accomplish its mission. What economic indicators would we find useful in seeking to formulate our monetary policy? Would we look only within Texas? Would we target a specific inflation rate? Which inflation gauge would we use? Would our inflation rate policies differ significantly from those of the United States sans Texas? Would real Texas interest rates be fully independent of or highly influenced, or perhaps determined, by U.S. rates? Would we need to take into account the monetary policy of the rest of the United States to determine our own proper monetary stimulus or restraint? Would our operating procedures via Texas’ overnight bank lending market have to change in order for us to achieve the desired policy results?\n\nWe know that, as with any central bank, the hypothetical Central Bank of Texas would have the power to debase the burrito by printing too much of it or by maladministering our franchise. But could we really, independently, determine the course of our own economy—the Texas economy? Could we affect our employment and output, given our real and virtual connections to the U.S. and the world around us? If not, should we then just rewrite our central banking mandate to focus solely on prices? And if we focused only on that important task, in seeking to restrain or otherwise impact prices, would we be able to make the variability in Texas’ inflation, and the corresponding inflation risk premium, less than that of the United States? Or would the inflationary impulses of the U.S. condition the dynamics of Texas’ inflation? And how about the lags in time between when our Texas Open Market Committee effects a change in policy and the corresponding impact on Texas prices? How would those lags be affected by activity in the rest of the United States?\n\nNow come back to the real world and transfer all those questions I just asked to the U.S. Federal Reserve operating in a hyper-interconnected world. To be sure, the weight of the United States in the global economic ecosystem is greater than the weight of Texas within the U.S. economy. But I wonder if that changes anything from the standpoint of this intellectual exercise.\n\nIs it really possible to assume that like the fictional, independent Central Bank of Texas, the Federal Reserve can make monetary policy without taking into account capacity constraints, levels of resource utilization, global liquidity and other factors impacting price developments in the rest of the world? How do we know what our true potential growth is without properly accounting for the world’s resource potential? How can we calculate our NAIRU—our non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment—without an accurate sense of workforce dynamics and price movements outside our geographic boundaries? Can we assume that the Taylor rule, our most trusted compass, is sufficient as is? Or does it require adjustment before it can point us to true north? Do the old paradigms that guided us in determining lags in monetary policy still hold?\n\nThanks to Janet Henry and others who have picked up the baton, I am happy to see some of our finest economic minds now devoting more attention to these important questions. This past summer, globalization was the front and center theme of the annual central bankers retreat at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed. In presentation after presentation, the world’s leading monetary policy scholars and practitioners—people like John Taylor, Ken Rogoff and the Bank of England’s Charlie Bean—talked about the implications of the global economy and the importance of looking beyond our national borders when setting policy.\n\nNow, let me return to Stan Fischer’s three economists. To be able to count, they need the right data to count with. Our reliance on domestic mathematics alone may be insufficient, but at least the Federal Reserve has access to a plethora of highly sophisticated, regularly measured and accurate data to put into its existing models. But as Janet knows, measuring the things we need in order to understand what is happening with the rest of the world can get rather dicey.\n\nWhat’s the first thing we might want to count? At a minimum, we would like to know how big, in economic terms, the rest of the world is. All countries produce estimates of aggregate activity, some in a more timely and user-friendly fashion than others. The standard national accounts give us a sense of how quickly economies grow, but they are less helpful in comparing the relative size of economies due to differences in national currencies, which are our measuring rods. To get around this, economists often look to estimates of purchasing power to figure out how big China is, for example, relative to the U.S. While this may be the correct way to make such comparison in theory, it is not clear that current practice lives up to this ideal.\n\nOne of my pet peeves is the confidence that analysts and journalists alike place in purchasing power parity (PPP) data to adjust real output to account for the presumed pecking order of national economies, based on their size and power. Recently, for example, China has been declared the world’s second-largest economy based upon PPP-adjusted output. And yet China’s output in 2005, when measured in unadjusted dollars, was $360 billion smaller than the production of the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, which covers California and eight other states. My colleague Bill Poole at the St. Louis Fed reminded us last summer that China’s real GDP per capita today is roughly the same as what the U.S. achieved in 1886. So arguing that China’s economy will surpass ours in size in the foreseeable future, as PPP aficionados like to argue, strikes me as a dodgy proposition. Yet, that said, there are compelling theoretical arguments for measuring economies in PPP terms, and doing so can give us added insights into relative developments among economies. But, again, we go back to Stan Fischer’s economists: You can’t add what doesn’t add up.\n\nThe raw material for PPP calculations is gathered under the guidance of the International Comparison Program, or ICP, which is coordinated by the World Bank and the OECD. Upon close examination, the ICP’s price comparisons appear to be fraught with errors. The problems seem to stem from the minuscule amount of resources devoted to gathering raw data. The rich countries of the EU, for example, devote something like one staff member per annum to gathering data for the ICP, a grossly deficient manpower commitment when you consider how many staff years go into the construction of national consumer price indexes and other metrics. One can only imagine how shoddy the situation is in less developed countries. Until statistical agencies like the ICP develop accurate measurements of purchasing-power-adjusted output, this oft-quoted measurement device will be of limited utility for policymakers and might even lead to false conclusions.\n\nMeasuring the size of the global labor pool might appear to be less tricky, but don’t be fooled by raw population numbers alone. Let’s go back to China. China has a population of about 1.3 billion and advertises a labor force of just under 800 million. However, many of these workers are employed in the traditional subsistence sector. How many of them can realistically transition from this sector to the modern sectors of the global economy, and how quickly could it happen? How interchangeable can we expect these workers to be with labor in the developed world? Will the availability of large stocks of underemployed rural labor keep wage pressures contained in developing nations like China, or will their limited ability to contribute to the modern economy cause bottlenecks along their road to economic development and integration? We already hear of growing labor shortages along China’s bustling coastal belt, raising questions about how easily underemployed rural workers can meet the needs of the New China that is feeding the global trading system.\n\nCan we make sense of the idea of a global output gap? It is standard practice in the central banking community to frame policy decisions in terms of price pressures stemming from resource utilization. As I have already argued, I believe it is insufficient to think in terms of domestic resource utilization alone in our globalized world: We need to be looking at capacity and slack at the global level. But how do we measure these things? We already have estimates of output gaps in the countries that belong to the OECD, but these countries account for a declining share of global output, and the estimates are subject to large revisions. The data needed to measure output gaps for emerging economies and developing countries in many, if not all, cases simply don’t exist. For example, despite the boom in fixed-asset investment under way in China, there are no official estimates of its capital stock, which is a basic component in measuring an output gap. Data that might serve as a substitute, such as capacity utilization or unemployment figures, are spotty at best, released erratically and difficult to interpret.\n\nAnd what about trade, my old stomping ground as deputy U.S. trade representative? I wonder whether our traditional measures of trade and current account balances adequately capture the full extent of our interaction with the rest of the world or the impact the rest of the world has on U.S. economic activity and inflation.\n\nFor example, economists tend to draw a distinction between traded and nontraded goods. By tradition, economists have assumed all commodities and physical goods can be shipped abroad, while services cannot. While the distinction between the two types of goods remains important, classifying services as inherently nontradable no longer makes complete sense. The technological revolution that has done so much to facilitate globalization has also opened the gates to a wider range of services to be traded internationally.\n\nThe essence of what it means to be tradable needs to be rethought with respect to services. The key distinction is between services that must be delivered face to face and those that can be delivered remotely. The actual skills required to perform a task are increasingly irrelevant in determining whether a service can be traded.\n\nTrade in goods and services is certainly an important dimension of openness, but it is not the only one. What about the labor market and worker mobility? The U.S is a nation of immigrants. The foreign-born make up about an eighth of our population. Like the U.K., our ability to attract the best and brightest and hardest working from around the globe is testimony to the strength and vitality of our economy. The skills and talents immigrants bring with them continually add to our stock of human capital, replenishing our workforce and reinvigorating our demographics.\n\nAs with labor, the U.S. continues to be a magnet for capital from abroad, a testimony to the strength of our economy, institutions and—if my friends in Brussels and the former occupant of the Palais de l’Elysée will forgive me—unique constitutional unity. As you know, looking only at net capital inflows ignores the true extent of our involvement in international capital markets; we need to look at the more substantial gross flows. Beyond the numbers, however, foreign direct investments knit our economies together. Direct investment by U.S. companies abroad and by foreign companies in the U.S. is probably one of the most important channels for the transmission of technical and managerial know-how across borders.\n\nI think I’ve posed enough examples and questions today, showing the deep void we need to fill. The bottom line is that we have a great deal of accounting and analytical work left to do as we seek to refine our ability to make monetary policy in a globalized world. Monetary policymaking at the Fed—as at the Bank of England or any other central bank—is an evolving craft, half art and half science, requiring as much prudent judgment as skilled analysis. The 18 men and women I have the honor of sitting with around the FOMC table are remarkably thoughtful and wise in their knowledge of the real world. My point is simply that the committee’s wisdom would be enhanced, and the economy would benefit, from having analytical tools to help us build more practicable models than what we currently have to guide our thinking as we make monetary policy in a complicated, reconfigured, globalized world. Today I appeal to you and your firms to help us develop these analytical tools either directly or by demanding them in the marketplace, where you wield considerable influence.\n\nSo much for the formal part of my presentation. Let me close there. But before doing so, I want the conveners of this conference to know that I did note the article in last Thursday’s Wall Street Journal. Stuart [Gulliver], it brought to mind the only quote my late Norwegian mother would dare utter from a Swedish king. Oscar II, who ruled until 1907, said something we always considered admirable in my family: “I would rather have people laugh at my economies than weep for my extravagance.”\n\nNow, I would be happy to avoid answering your questions about the U.S. economy and interest rates. And then I must beetle off to the Garrick Club for dinner.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "September 25, 2006 Monterrey, N.L., México\n\nI am with you today in Monterrey as the first part of a two-way exchange. Tomorrow, I will have the privilege of hosting my friend Guillermo Ortiz, the governor of the Banco de México, in Dallas. Today, he and Deputy Governor Elizondo have kindly arranged for me to be here. These two events, occurring together, are perhaps symbolic of the widespread ties that make Mexico and Texas inseparable and—I suppose for those who do not understand the profound nature of our bond—occasionally insufferable. We share a common history and a deep ongoing relationship that is unique among the United States.\n\nThe bond is personal for me. I grew up in Mexico—in the Distrito Federal. I spent my childhood there, and I recall it fondly. The first movie I can remember seeing was Marcelino Pan y Vino. (After seeing that magnificent film, I was never again afraid of the scorpions that inhabited our house in Mexico City.) I played Little League baseball for the Aztecas, playing second fiddle to my brother, whose team took on Monterrey for the right to represent Mexico in the Little League World Series. Angel Macias and his great Monterrey team, the appropriately named Industrials, won that game and went on to win the Series that year.\n\nWhen we were not on the playing field, we were under the stern professorial eyes of the Sierra Madre School, where I learned Mexican history before I learned U.S. history. My mother used to say that until I was 18, I knew more about Hidalgo and Benito Juárez than I did about Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMy sense of humor—which my children will tell you is rather slapstick—was shaped by Mario Moreno Reyes, better known as Cantinflas. Of course, that is the sense of humor I had before becoming a stoic and deadpan central banker.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that I have a profound respect and affection for Mexico and her people. Soy parte mexicano y con orgullo. It is an honor to be here to speak to you today.\n\nThis morning, I plan to talk about the economies of the United States, Mexico and Texas. Before I do, however, I need to remind you that I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Open Market Committee, nor for any of the other committee members. So the thoughts I express this morning are purely my own.\n\nJust last week, we had another FOMC meeting and collectively decided the best course of action was to leave the federal funds rate unchanged.\n\nAfter participating in those discussions, it is always instructive to sit back and read the various interpretations that pour forth from well-meaning analysts about what action the committee took or did not take and what was said or left unsaid in the press release that follows the meeting. I liken this process to the ancient ritual of divining the future by slicing open animals to study their entrails. The analytical community dissects our statements and presumed intentions with the greatest of care. It is definitely less gory than the rituals of ancient civilizations. But it is only slightly more accurate as a predictor of the future.\n\nIf it would be helpful as you “study the entrails” of the FOMC, let me give you a quick précis of how I see the U.S. economy and its impact on the deliberations over monetary policy.\n\nIn roughly six weeks, the U.S. economy will celebrate the fifth anniversary of its current economic expansion. Where do we stand on the eve of this milestone? We have a serious correction taking place in the housing sector. Sales, starts and permits are all down, in a range of 10 to 25 percent over the past year. In a few local housing markets—especially in the coastal areas—home prices have peaked and are beginning to decline. This may well be the most over-anticipated and over-analyzed downturn in history. One prominent CEO recently told me that “the only situation that has received more intense analysis than the housing market was the birth of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s baby.” But it is a serious matter nonetheless, with not insignificant consequences for the economy.\n\nHome prices in many markets ran ahead of themselves, outstripping rents, incomes and demographic trends. Cheap financing combined with mortgage finance “innovations”—another name for speculative leverage facilitated by excess liquidity—added to the fervor. Indeed, one can make a cogent argument that the housing market excesses were due as much to financial construction as to good old-fashioned physical construction, and that the spigot of liquidity that bloated the stock and prices of housing was open longer than it should have been in a world of less ingenious financial engineering. Regardless, the market for residential real estate had to adjust, and it is now doing so.\n\nJoseph is patron saint for home buying and selling. If you were to have read yesterday’s Orlando Sentinel newspaper, you would have discovered that there has been a run on statues of St. Joseph in various states as fear of the downturn in housing markets has spread. Sellers of homes are burying his statue in their yards in hopes of luring a willing buyer! Apparently, the practice of asking intercession from the saints is alive and well in the United States.\n\nWhat is happening in the U.S. housing market is hardly unique. It is the nature of almost all markets to overshoot and then be subject to correction. It can be a painful correction for those who lose track of the difference between price and value and underlying fundamentals. As long as that correction is orderly and does not threaten the economy’s financial stability, we are best advised to let it run its course, monitoring it carefully to ensure that it does not infect the rest of the economy.\n\nWe are fortunate that the rest of the economy is healthy and robust. The banking system is in good shape. There is still plenty of liquidity in the financial sector. Corporate balance sheets are strong. Investment in plant and equipment is proceeding apace. Production is being reinforced by the settling down of commodity price pressures. Consumers are getting a shot in the arm from lower gasoline and natural gas prices. And, very important, the rest of the world is growing faster than the United States, further mitigating the downside risks of a slowing U.S. economy.\n\nBefore each FOMC meeting, I talk to 30 or so CEOs and CFOs at major companies in all sectors of the U.S. economy. The perspectives of these business operators often balance the good work of our economics staff. Mind you, each of these business leaders is fully aware of the risks posed by the housing market correction. They have discounted the most likely, as well as the most grim, of housing scenarios into their planning horizons. They have adjusted their plans as GDP growth slowed from almost 6 percent in the first quarter to just under 3 percent in the second quarter and to a level probably a touch below that for the quarter that ends this coming Saturday. These business leaders are wary but nonetheless upbeat. They are confident U.S. growth will continue at a healthy pace through the fourth quarter and beyond. One of the most experienced CEOs I regularly visit summarizes it this way: “We were all expecting things to be worse, but they haven’t gotten worse. We were all expecting things to get tougher, but they haven’t gotten tougher.”\n\nExcept in one area: procurement of labor. I am hearing more and more reports about the difficulty of finding labor to work our oil fields or run our chemical plants. Bankers complain of a paucity of bank clerks and tellers. Truckers are experiencing a shortage of drivers. In Houston, we are hearing complaints about the difficulty of finding cashiers for retail establishments. A major hotelier told me last week that there is a shortage of housekeeping staff. And for those who source abroad, finding ever cheaper inputs has become noticeably more difficult as growth in sourcing countries eats up available capacity. Having achieved a considerable amount of operating leverage from outsourcing and aggressively pushing the envelope of cyberspace, companies are now voicing the kinds of complaints about labor shortages most often heard in a full employment economy.\n\nSeveral surveys of business executives have been released in the past week, all of which underscore the slower growth beginning to prevail. This includes recent surveys of the manufacturing sectors of the megastate of Texas by the Dallas Fed; the survey of the smaller but nonetheless meaningful production of eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware by the Philadelphia Fed; the National Federation of Independent Business; the Business Roundtable; and Duke University’s Global CFO Survey.\n\nLumping it all together, I am reminded of Mark Twain’s oft-quoted quip: “Wagner’s music is better than it sounds.” The outlook for economic growth may well be better than it sounds. At the same time, the inflation dynamic may be worse than it sounds.\n\nAs I sit at the FOMC table, I continue to fret more about inflation than I do about growth. While I am well aware of the risks to economic growth, the history of inverted yield curves, and the ever present possibility of exogenous shocks in a politically hazardous world, the “balance of risk,” in my book, is still tilted to the inflation side of the equation. Let me give you some math to illustrate why.\n\nThe most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) release rounded the core figure—which excludes the often volatile food and energy prices—to 0.2 percent in August, the same as July, indicating to the naked eye that inflation fundamentals were unchanged. But you have to look below the surface. Rounding can hide some underlying dynamics. July’s rate was actually 0.19 percent. August’s was 0.24 percent. To a normal person, this brings to mind the old saw that economists simply put two numbers to the right of a decimal point to show they have a sense of humor. But to a humorless central banker, the magic of compound interest gives meaning to the exercise and presents a different picture, one less benign than back-to-back 0.2 percent readings. On a 12-month basis, the core CPI was 2.4 percent for July. The rate for August was 2.9 percent. August’s core CPI, in other words, was midway between July’s low reading and the more elevated figures of the previous four months.\n\nHold that thought: The latest reading of core consumer inflation was close to 3 percent, not 2 percent, measured at face value.\n\nAs you may know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland does not take the reported CPI at face value. They slice and dice the CPI to get a median measurement that some of us feel provides a more accurate picture of price pressures. The Cleveland Fed’s median figure for the August CPI came in at 3.4 percent annualized. They also have a measure that lops off the most volatile and presumably least sustainable components of the CPI. For August, that number came in at 2.9 percent, which closely tracks the Dallas Fed’s latest trimmed-mean estimate or 3.1 percent for Personal Consumer Expenditures inflation.\n\nTo some, 3.1 percent does not seem all that dreadful. Let me assure you that were that level of inflation sustained, it would seriously debauch the dollar. At that rate of inflation, a dollar quickly gets whittled down to cents. In 10 years, it is whittled down to 73 cents; in 15 years, it falls to 62 cents. I don’t know a soul on the FOMC who would accept that kind of erosion in the purchasing power of our currency.\n\nBut, ah, you ask, didn’t the Producer Price Index (PPI) that came out on Thursday exhibit considerable price restraint? Indeed it did. Excluding food and energy, it actually showed overall price deflation. But we must be careful not to grasp at straws here. The PPI is very “noisy” to economists’ ears. Historically, it has not been very useful in forecasting consumer price inflation. Indeed, when our colleagues at the Cleveland Fed were studying the PPI a few years ago and trying to devise a way to trim out the most volatile of its components so as to get a measurement of what it showed as sustainable trends, they found they would have to trim out 90 percent of the items. It is hard to hang your hat on the PPI as an indicator of underlying inflationary trends.\n\nSo the central banker’s brow, not having access to the intellectual equivalent of Botox, begins to furrow. If you are an inflation fighter, a vague recollection of Shakespeare’s Taming of the Shrew springs to mind in Hortensio’s cry, “There’s small choice in rotten apples.” The most reliable indicators of inflationary pressure are not yet comforting. Inflation remains elevated and leaves us small choice but to remain vigilant.\n\nThe FOMC left its monetary target—the fed funds rate—unchanged last week at 5.25 percent. I accept that decision. While the inflation risk I have just elucidated is very much on my mind, it is my considered judgment that the recent tempering of U.S. economic growth to a more sustainable rate, combined with the lagged effects of our 17 prior quarter-point rate increases, should act to lower the inflation rate over time. However, if this proves not to be the case, appropriate action will have to be taken.\n\nDeputy Governor Elizondo will certainly agree with me that central bankers abhor inflation. It is a destructive force that erodes confidence, gnaws away at the value of money and undermines growth. In Mexico, once-chronic inflation has all but disappeared. Your country now boasts its lowest inflation in 30 years.\n\nNeither the U.S. economy nor the Mexican can prosper unless inflation is kept under wraps. And, neither country can achieve maximum potential economic growth without the aid of the other.\n\nOur two economies are like two ships lashed together as they navigate the turbulent seas of the global economy. As any sailor knows, when two ships are tied together, they move together. Often, it may seem as though Mexico is being towed along by the United States. I disagree. Increasingly, Mexico has become a critical part of our industrial base as a supplier of our inputs. In many ways, we are not just increasingly interdependent, we are also becoming integrated.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Mexico’s exports are destined for the United States. And two-thirds of all foreign direct investment into Mexico comes from U.S. investors. Looked at from my side of the frontera, Mexico is the second largest importer of U.S. goods, well ahead of Germany, Japan and China. Mexican workers provide a significant part of the economic muscle that makes our economy so mighty. And Mexican inputs are a vital part of the supply lines of American businesses.\n\nThe numbers tell the story of our interdependency. Since 1980, the ratio of Mexico’s exports to GDP has tripled, predominately fueled by sales of manufactured products to the U.S. Many of these are intermediate and capital goods, which account for almost three-fourths of Mexico’s exports to the U.S. A red-hot U.S. expansion between 1994 and 2000 enabled Mexico to grow faster than any other Latin American economy. The good times came to an end in the fall of 2000, when U.S. manufacturing slowed and then stalled, hitting no country harder than Mexico. This was reversed as the U.S. economy gained steam in the ensuing recovery.\n\nTrends in 2006 reinforce the importance of U.S. manufacturing to Mexico. Industrial production here is stout. This strength, combined with healthy growth in domestic demand, helps explain the 4.5 percent economic growth private forecasters predict this year for Mexico.\n\nIt is important to recognize that the correlation between our two nations’ economies has not always been the rule. For a quarter century prior to the 1982 crisis, Mexico experienced nothing short of an economic miracle, keeping pace with Taiwan and Korea. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy in the 1970s was suffering through stagflation. You were up, we were down. When we finally emerged from our malaise in the 1980s, Mexico experienced a lost decade of economic stagnation and financial crises. You were down, we were up. The synchronization of our two nations’ business cycles really only began in the 1990s. Before then, the two countries appeared to be on mostly perpendicular paths.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nMost obviously, our trade ties have strengthened. But is this a satisfactory explanation? Economists are debating whether increased trade integration alone leads to more business cycle synchronization. The debate centers on the nature of what is being traded. When trade ties lead nations to specialize in different products, their business cycles may in fact diverge. However, when trade consists predominately of goods and services within the same production stream, as is the case between Mexico and the U.S., business cycles are more likely to line up. It is no coincidence that the Mexican states that trade the most with the U.S. are the most sensitive to U.S. industrial activity.\n\nThe foreign trade and investment explosion Mexico has enjoyed over the past two decades also owes a great deal to the country’s growing commitment to policy discipline.\n\nRecent developments here, with which you are all very familiar, are indeed impressive. A recent report by the World Bank praised Mexico for its recent economic reforms, achieving the top ranking among Latin American economies for having the most improved business climate.\n\nPrices have become more stable than ever. People can invest in Mexico without the considerable worry about inflation. An important ingredient in Mexico’s success on this front was the 1994 constitutional amendment that created a fully independent central bank with price stability as its main goal. With a clearly stated objective and constitutional protection, Banco de México has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting, rightfully earning the respect of the international investment and monetary policy communities.\n\nOther policy changes have strengthened Mexico’s economy and reduced its vulnerability to financial crises. Fiscal responsibility and low budget deficits have brought well-deserved praise. This has enabled Mexico to greatly improve the composition of its debt. The government ran into trouble a decade ago in part because most of its debt was in foreign hands, dollar-denominated and short-term. In 1994, 85 percent of Mexico’s public debt was held outside the country. Today, the ratio is 40 percent. Emblematic of the effort to rely more on domestic sources of finance is the fact that Mexico was able to retire all its Brady debt three years ago, becoming the first country to do so.\n\nAt the same time, Mexico now borrows on better, longer terms than 10 years ago. In 1995, Mexico didn’t even have a yield curve. There was no market for Mexican bonds with more than a year to maturity. Recently, however, Mexico successfully issued 20-year fixed-rate, peso-denominated bonds, and the Ministry of Finance has announced it would start issuing 30-year bonds in the fourth quarter—a truly marvelous accomplishment.\n\nAnother important policy change involves exchange rates. I certainly don’t have to tell anyone in this room about the costs of past attempts to maintain a fixed currency value. A free-floating peso has helped Mexico’s economy adjust gradually to shifts in foreign trade and investment, preventing the buildup of the pressures that eventually show up as a sudden shock.\n\nGiven all this progress, Mexico’s financial markets have proven remarkably resilient during this turbulent election year. Past elections have given investors reason to be wary. The track record hadn’t been impressive as presidential transitions often sparked financial turmoil in Mexico as the change in power presented opportunities for new leaders to reconsider past commitments. In this election cycle, there have been few signs of investor anxiety, a testament to the new stability of Mexico’s fiscal house.\n\nGone are the days when my predecessors at the Federal Reserve or other analysts would warn of Mexico’s vulnerability to financial shocks. Today, concern focuses on the absence of badly needed structural reforms that would encourage long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\nThe list of needed reforms is well-known, and you hardly need a gringo to elucidate them. You would probably agree with me that Mexico would benefit tremendously from improvements in educational infrastructure and labor reforms. The economy could also use better enforcement of property rights and more effective tax laws. Implementing these reforms is the greatest challenge facing the new presidential administration.\n\nCritics of mine might venture that in my enthusiasm for Mexico I tend to gloss over the problem of corruption, which remains nettlesome for both Mexican citizens and foreign investors. I am well aware of it. Indeed, one of my favorite Cantinflas films was El Señor Fotógrafo. You may not remember it. The plotline concerns government corruption and, of course, with Cantinflas involved, the bad guys were routed in a highly comedic but determined fashion. I have high hopes that the example of a virtuous and independent central bank and other institutional reforms that have been put in place by the past two presidential administrations will continue the determined process of routing out corruption.\n\nIt would be un-Texan of me not to conclude with some words about my state and our unique relationship with the states of Mexico. If the Mexican and U.S. economies are joined at the hip, that would make the Texas economy the hip bone. Few U.S. states benefit more from Mexican purchases than Texas. The United States exported $120 billion in goods to Mexico in 2005, 42 percent of which were exported by Texas. Only 15 percent came from California. Overall, Texas exports grew nearly 4 percent in the second quarter of this year, following 5 percent growth in the first quarter. Texas is now the largest exporting state in the U.S., in no small part thanks to Mexico.\n\nFor most of its history, the Texas economy has grown faster than the United States as a whole and continues to do so today. This is to Mexico’s benefit.\n\nEven as the signs point to a slowing U.S. economy, Texas remains a shining star. In 2005, Texas gross state product increased at a rate of 4.3 percent, compared with 3.2 percent GDP growth for the U.S as a whole. We are adding jobs almost twice as fast as the rest of the country. Texas employment growth has been spread across many sectors, with almost all outperforming their national counterparts.\n\nSignificant to Mexico is the fact that the Texas construction industry is growing strongly. In the first quarter of 2005, our construction employment grew at an astounding 11.5 percent pace, followed by a 3.4 percent pace in the second quarter. Our latest reading from July and August suggests a 9.4 percent annual rate. Compare these growth rates to 4.3 percent for the construction industry across the rest of the U.S. in the first quarter and essentially no growth since then.\n\nAs real estate markets undergo a price correction across the country, our markets have not slowed nearly as much. On the whole, home sales have yet to turn downward in Texas. We are aware of the rising delinquency rates Texans are accruing on their mortgages. Only some of this is due to an oversubscription to those creative financing products I discussed a few minutes ago; mostly it is a result of high leverage coupled with slower appreciation. We do have an increasing inventory of new homes for sale, but the existing home market remains healthy, with increasing sales and some modest price gains.\n\nAs a whole, U.S. industrial production posted a 4.6 percent annual growth rate at last count. As you will see when we release the Dallas Fed’s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey shortly after I conclude this speech, Texas manufacturing activity remains strong, with general business conditions and planned capital spending continuing to improve. Many factories are reporting increased production and healthy capacity utilization and volumes, although slightly less than what we were seeing a month ago. This should encourage you, particularly, for it implies continued prosperity for Mexico’s maquiladora sector. Employment in the maquiladoras all along your side of the border grew at an annualized pace of 9.4 percent last June, adding 37,800 jobs over the prior year, with an even more impressive pace among the towns closest to the Texas border.\n\nEstimados Amigos, me da mucho gusto estar aquí en Monterrey acompañado de Ustedes. Gracias por la oportunidad de hablarles sobre el tema de la economía de nuestros países. Como ya saben, México tiene un lugar muy especial en mi corazón. Y yo estoy seguro que, apoyándonos uno al otro, juntos podemos lograr un gran futuro. Como miembro del Comité Federal de Operaciones de Mercado Abierto de los Estados Unidos, espero poder trabajar con el Banco de México y con todos Ustedes, para asegurar un mejor futuro para nuestros hijos, tanto Mexicanos como Tejanos y Americanos. Gracias por su paciencia."

        "content": "August 30, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nReal estate runs on borrowed money—so I suspect most of you keep a sharp eye on Federal Reserve policymaking and its effect on interest rates. At times, I am sure, we have made your business more difficult for you, but I urge you to keep in mind the Fed’s raison d’être. We are charged with maintaining the monetary conditions for sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. Will Rogers once quipped that “the three greatest inventions of man were fire, the wheel and central banking.” Given the times, shortly after the failure of the Bank of the United States and the onset of the Great Depression, he just may have been striking a sarcastic note! Even so, the idea of an independent central bank like the Federal Reserve is, I think, an ingenious one.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. One of the more successful and brilliant aspects of this legislation was the creation of 12 regional banks that would influence monetary policymaking. Having representatives from all parts of the country brings a deeper, more diverse perspective to the policy debate, giving a clearer view of what is really happening in the U.S. economy.\n\nTexas lobbied Washington heavily to host one of the 12 regional banks. Dallas won out over Fort Worth and Houston, largely because of the efforts of Dallas Morning News publisher George B. Dealey. He rallied support for Dallas by recruiting influential Texans in Washington to back the city’s cause. Dealey’s emissaries succeeded by pleading their case before the Treasury secretary and President Wilson himself.\n\nDallas won its bid to become a Reserve Bank city on April 3, 1914, the same day, incidentally, that Pancho Villa’s forces captured the Mexican town of Torreón. Other notable events that year included the completion of the Panama Canal, the start of World War I and the invention of the air conditioner. I will leave it to you to decide whether that last one tops the Dallas Fed in importance to this great city’s development.\n\nFew Dallas institutions have survived as long as the Dallas Fed. We have been part of the downtown community since we opened, moving from temporary quarters to that stately building on Akard Street in 1921 and then to our current building on Pearl Street, just opposite the Arts District, in 1992. We have the third longest continuous business presence in downtown Dallas and are proud of it. Of the remaining downtown institutions, only the Morning News and Neiman Marcus predate our arrival in Dallas.\n\nThe Dallas Fed has been at its best in hard times. During the Great Depression, our employees voluntarily took 5 percent pay cuts so the Bank could share the work and hire unemployed Dallasites. In an earlier recession, panicked customers stampeded a Dallas bank, demanding to withdraw their money. It was the kind of run that could ruin a bank. The head of the Dallas Fed, a man named W. F. Ramsey, showed up in an armored car with guards. They hauled a quarter million dollars into the lobby—where everyone could see it. In a scene right out of It’s a Wonderful Life, Ramsey jumped on a desk and shouted across the crowded lobby that he had $30 million more sitting in the Fed’s vault down the street. Just like that, the bank run ended.\n\nThe Fed has come a long way from its early years. Today, we employ more than 1,300 people in Texas, almost a thousand of them in Dallas. Each year, the Dallas Fed processes 1 billion paper checks worth about $900 billion and between 240 million and 300 million electronic checks and handles 5.4 billion in circulating banknotes worth nearly $92 billion. We continue to supply the liquidity banking customers need in times of potential and real crises, such as Y2K, the aftermath of 9/11 and last year’s devastating hurricanes. Our operations require an underground vault the size of a five-story building—quite something, when you realize our vault was little more than an office safe in 1914.\n\nOur other responsibilities include supervising the banking industry within the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and stability. We have public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community and host many public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy. We maintain a first-rate research department that provides me with the authoritative economic analysis I need for my role on the Federal Open Market Committee—the FOMC—as well as speeches like this one.\n\nI mean it when I say first-rate. Some of you may not know that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team for the past 13 years, won the Nobel Prize for economics in 2004. Finn is with me this morning. Now, he is a Norwegian and is therefore genetically incapable of promoting or drawing attention to himself. Nevertheless, I am going to embarrass Finn and ask him to stand up and take a bow.\n\nOur current analysis points to an economy at a crossroads. High energy prices, rising interest rates and the slowdown in a red-hot housing market have taken some of the steam out of what had been a fairly robust expansion. At the same time, our current inflation indicators are not presently as well behaved as I would like them to be. Central bankers are always concerned when inflation starts to rear its ugly head. We know from experience that once inflation gains momentum, it becomes harder and harder to stop.\n\nAs you know from reading this morning’s papers, at our last meeting of the FOMC, we collectively decided to pause in raising the fed funds rate after 17 consecutive rounds of quarter-point tightenings. It was the collective judgment of the committee that we were at a juncture where it made sense to evaluate the lagged effect of these tightenings, especially on the inflationary impetus of the economy.\n\nHow do we define inflation, and how do we measure it? This is a question I want to discuss in depth with you today. Before I do, however, let me issue the usual disclaimer that today, as always, I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Open Market Committee, nor for any of the other committee members.\n\nInflation is an increase in the general price level. If prices for all goods and services went up in the same proportion, over some period of time—if all prices increased by, say, 2 percent over the past 12 months—there would be no difficulty in identifying the rate of inflation: It would be 2 percent a year. In reality, over any stretch of time, some prices will rise faster than others and some may actually decline. When we speak of inflation as a sustained increase in the “general level of prices,” we have in mind an increase in an average of all prices.\n\nThis average is more sophisticated than a simple arithmetic mean. We don’t want to treat a 10 percent increase in the price of pepper, for example, as having the same importance as a 10 percent increase in the price of shelter, clothing or transportation. So the formulas we use weight items by how important they are in people’s budgets.\n\nDifferences in weighting, and the scope of goods and services included, give rise to the various inflation measures we hear reported on radio and television broadcasts or read about in the papers. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) focuses on the prices of the goods and services consumed by a typical urban household. The price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) looks more broadly at all goods and services purchased for final consumption and, additionally, uses a more sophisticated weighting scheme than the CPI. Most broadly, the price index for gross domestic product, also known as the GDP deflator, looks at the prices of all goods and services produced in the economy; thus, it includes not just consumer goods, but also capital goods and government-provided services.\n\nNow, bear with me here.\n\nEach of these measures comes in two flavors: “headline” and “core.” The latter—the “core”—excludes prices for food and energy. The man on the street—someone known to occasionally purchase food and gas and air-condition or heat his home—often puzzles at policymakers’ focus on core inflation. To add to that man’s confusion, it is not uncommon for the press to report the same inflation numbers in different ways. When July’s CPI numbers were reported earlier this month, a Washington Post article stated, “The Labor Department reported yesterday that inflation rose last month, eating into people’s paychecks and savings at a quickening clip.” The same day, New York Times readers learned that “the government’s latest report on consumer prices, issued yesterday, suggests that inflation is slowing.” Both were right. The Post had focused on the headline rate, which had picked up relative to the month before, while the Times focused on the core rate, which had fallen a bit from prior months.\n\nPolicymakers and economists tend to focus on the core measures because they strip out volatile items and show more stability than headline inflation. The core measures give a better indication of the underlying inflationary trends that matter most in formulating policy.\n\nI have been using the word “core” as shorthand for “excluding food and energy,” and that is the common connotation. To be precise, however, “ex food and energy” measures are but one form of the core rate, and—according to research at the Dallas Fed, the Cleveland Fed and elsewhere—not even necessarily the best. The Dallas Fed has created a measure of core inflation called the Trimmed-Mean PCE inflation rate. It is calculated by stripping out the most volatile price movements each month, regardless of whether the items in question are food, energy or something else, in order to not be distracted by temporary price rises or declines and to enable us to focus instead on the underlying trend of inflation.\n\nThe Trimmed-Mean PCE in one month this past spring, for example, excluded guns, which were set aside because of a big price decline, and funeral expenses, deleted because of a big price increase. I won’t speculate on whether these price movements were related.\n\nCentral bankers abhor inflation and deflation. Our mantra is “price stability.” Taken literally, this means zero inflation. But our inflation measures are imperfect and likely biased upward, so many central bankers see price stability as a very low, though positive, rate of measured inflation. The point is to have an inflation rate that is, in its economic effects, essentially zero. Stated differently, we seek to create the monetary conditions for an economy where inflation is not distorting anyone’s decisions.\n\nWhy do we value price stability? Somewhere in France, there is—or at least there used to be—a rod that precisely defines a meter. It is quite useful to know that the length of that rod is constant from one month to the next, one year to the next. This is the only way to ensure that those 10-meter doohickeys that are on order, when they arrive, will fit with the 10-meter doodads you already have on hand. The best situation is a rod that doesn’t change—“meter stability,” if you will. Next best would be a rod that changed in predictable ways—say, a rod known to grow by 2 percent a year. Setting aside the question of where—after many years—one would keep such a rod, people could at least confidently plan for the future. The worst case, of course, would be a rod that changed unpredictably—some months growing by “X” percent, some months actually shrinking. Manufacturers and others, like the people who organize marathons, would expend resources attempting to predict changes in the rod’s length—resources that could have been put to more productive use. And still, at the end of the day, some of their plans would come to naught because of unforeseen variations. You couldn’t build a new house under those circumstances, or a factory, or a school, or practically anything else.\n\nInflation is a bit like having a measuring stick that grows or shrinks from one month to the next; the “doohickeys” and “doodads” that need to fit together, in this case, are prices for money or goods today and in the future. You get the picture. The consequences of a randomly varying dollar value would be severe. It doesn’t take a Finn Kydland to conclude that low and predictable inflation is preferable to high and variable inflation and that low and predictable inflation should be the goal of your central bank.\n\nThe evidence suggests central bankers have had some success in that pursuit. In the U.S. and elsewhere, inflation has been brought down to near-negligible levels and has become more predictable in the past 20 years.\n\nIn 1993, a great economist named John Taylor proposed a simple rule for conducting monetary policy. He recommended setting interest rates based on two inputs: first, the deviation of actual inflation from the central bank’s desired rate and, second, a measure of the economy’s excess capacity, usually called the “output gap.” The Taylor rule recommends raising nominal interest rates—that is, tightening monetary policy—whenever inflation is above its target or output is temporarily above its long-term potential.\n\nThe Taylor rule begat the Taylor principle, which recommends how much to tighten in response to a given deviation of inflation from its target. It suggests that increases in nominal interest rates need to be greater than the rise in inflation. In response to a 1 percentage point increase in inflation, for example, the principle might prescribe a 1.5 percentage point increase in nominal interest rates. If you do the math, you will see that a rise in inflation has been met with an increase in the real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate. Higher real interest rates act as a tap on the economy’s brakes, slowing the pace of real activity and reducing upward pressure on prices.\n\nJohn Taylor originally formulated his rule as a prescription for policymakers. But it turns out that, at least since the mid-1980s, the Taylor rule is a good description of how the Fed has conducted monetary policy. While the Fed has never bound itself to any explicit policy rule, its de facto adherence to the Taylor principle since the mid-1980s has paid off handsomely in terms of achieving price stability. Inflation measured by the PCE price index averaged about 7 percent in the 1970s, 4.5 percent in the 1980s and 2.2 percent in the 1990s and through the first half of this decade.\n\nIn the simplest version of the Taylor rule, current inflation is the primary determinant of a central bank’s policy actions. In the real world, policymakers look at many other indicators to gauge inflationary pressures before they show up in actual inflation rates. This makes sense, given the lags between policy actions and their ultimate effects on the economy—lags that economist Milton Friedman famously described as “long and variable.”\n\nAmong the additional variables we look at are measures of capacity utilization of business operators and tightness in the labor market—for example, the unemployment rate. Strong job growth will lead to demands for higher pay. Many of you might wonder why that could ever be bad. Well, when it comes to workers’ pay and benefits, it is not the increases themselves that cause concern. Problems occur when labor costs rise faster than gains in labor productivity. When that happens, firms often see shrinking profit margins, which add to pressure to raise product prices. What policymakers look at is unit labor costs, a measure of workers’ pay adjusted for productivity.\n\nEven if we cull out the misleading signals, the traditional data set may no longer be sufficient. At the Dallas Fed, we are exploring the notion that capacity measures must be extended beyond the domestic market. Today, we live in a world where goods, services, money, and the ideas and tasks performed by American businesses cross international borders with great ease. It stands to reason, then, that inflationary trends in any economy cannot be properly assessed without knowing how readily resources, inputs, finished products and capital from outside the country can be brought to bear. The Dallas Fed’s globalization initiative is aimed at developing measures of these broader output gaps, which we hope will let us determine how the dramatic rise of China and India, for example, or the processing of tasks in cyberspace will impact inflation in the U.S.\n\nMonetary policy does not give central banks a lever to control inflation directly. In focusing on interest rates, the FOMC influences demand for credit, which in turn affects growth and inflation. At any given time, of course, all sectors of the economy may not be in sync, adding great complexity to the art of central banking. In the early part of this decade, the Fed was concerned about the deflationary impact of the high-tech investment bust, and it responded by lowering interest rates on overnight, short-term borrowing by member banks. In the past three years, we reversed much of that stimulus, at first because investment began recovering and more recently because inflation was at risk of becoming uncomfortably high.\n\nWhich brings us to the subject dear to your hearts—real estate. On the national level, recent data indicate that housing markets weakened further in mid-summer. The holy trinity of housing reports—starts, existing-home sales and new-home sales—all came in much weaker in July than expected by mainstream economists, with inventories of unsold homes continuing to rise. Stepping back to include weakness shown before last month, permits and new-home sales are down about 20 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe declines are moving housing markets from very high and unsustainable levels toward more normal levels, unwinding some speculative activity. We are monitoring the effect this will have on the economy with due respect for its gravity. But it is not a one-sided deal; not all the consequences of the unwinding of a bull market in housing are bad. For example, a beneficial side effect of slower demand is that upward pressures on housing prices are abating. The pace of home-price appreciation has slowed dramatically—from double-digit year-over-year rates last fall to low single digits in recent readings. As prices cool off, we may finally begin the long process of allowing income to catch up with housing costs, helping make homes more affordable in the long run.\n\nLet me give you an example of what I am referring to. In 1999, 43 percent of the residents of Los Angeles could afford a median-priced home. By the end of last year, only 2 percent could. For New York, the comparable figures were 55 percent that could afford a median-priced home in 1999 and 6 percent in 2006. The figures for Dallas, incidentally, were unchanged over the period. At the end of last year, 62 percent of Dallasites could afford a median-priced home, which explains why our local housing market is holding up better than the markets on the West and East coasts.\n\nWith home-price appreciation no longer running rampant, we are likely to see fewer homeowners tapping into their home equity, which had been fueling a consumption boom and diverting savings from investment. From a broader perspective, the slowing of housing and consumption frees up resources for investment and a more balanced economy. Some good news can be found by looking carefully at durable goods orders, which foreshadow private investment. Their recent rise suggests that businesses are starting to increase their capacity following the investment bust a few years back. Spending on plant and equipment is crucial to supporting productivity growth, the source of long-term gains in living standards.\n\nThe stirring of business investment has helped spark a revival in commercial real estate construction to accommodate the many firms aiming to expand their workspaces. Indeed, we may be seeing the start of a great rotation away from household spending to investment and to more healthy and balanced growth. In setting monetary policy, we assess inflationary pressures and gauge aggregate demand by adding up some sectors that are weakening, like housing, along with sectors that are expanding, like commercial construction and investment.\n\nI will wrap up by bringing things closer to home—the Texas and Dallas real estate markets, which diverge from national trends, particularly on the housing side. The housing markets all across Texas are healthy compared with the rest of the U.S. While we have seen some signs of cooling, traffic and sales are still strong. We are hearing more reports of cancellations, mostly attributed to relocation buyers not being able to sell their West Coast homes. This is not “Texas brag.” If you listen to business leaders in El Paso, for example, you will hear them say that West Texas is being invaded by two forces: the U.S. Army and Californians. The consolidation of military bases in the El Paso area, combined with relocators from Southern California, is changing the character of once-sleepy El Paso.\n\nThroughout the state, housing starts outpaced sales in the second quarter, despite record-setting sales figures. And our apartment markets have improved along with the economy. So far this year, apartment demand is keeping up with supply, helping vacancy rates stay around 10 percent in most Texas markets. We are hearing reports of strong office-leasing activity from both local and relocating firms, as well as increasing requests for large blocks of office space. Office, industrial and warehouse rents are picking up, along with construction activity in several areas in Texas, especially in Dallas. We are also hearing numerous reports of the difficulty developers are having finding construction workers as well as rising pressure on wages.\n\nIn the Metroplex, the housing market has been quite strong for over five years. Dallas–Fort Worth has ranked in the top four among U.S. metropolitan areas in single-family permits since 2000. New-home sales set records in the first and second quarters of 2006, while existing-home sales cooled a bit. Year-to-date existing-home sales are flat compared with last year, and July sales were down 10 percent. The median price of homes in the area, however, is still rising modestly. Apartment markets are relatively healthy, with occupancies above 90 percent and three consecutive quarters of modest rent hikes.\n\nDallas’ office market has made a comeback in the past few years, but that really does not show up in vacancy rates, presently ranked second highest in the U.S. Interestingly, Dallas’ commercial vacancy rate is about 23 percent, while Fort Worth’s is 6 percent. Despite the ranking, demand for space is increasing, and large blocks are diminishing in certain submarkets. Construction has increased dramatically, especially in downtown Dallas, Uptown and Far North Dallas. Our contacts are convinced that occupancy, demand and rents in these areas justify the pace of construction. The industrial market continues to improve, with most of the gains coming from the warehouse side. The retail market has benefited from the strong housing market over the past several years, but demand appears to have ebbed recently, giving cause for caution. However, retail vacancies remain relatively low, at about 10 percent, and construction activity is up strongly.\n\nA word of caution is in order, however, because national trends do have an impact on the local market. Nationally, there is a lot of cash in capital markets looking for sustainable projects to be invested in. The result is that capitalization rates have been pushed down, raising concern among some industry analysts, especially in a condominium market that seems to reflect an excess of supply relative to demand at the margin. We have seen the effect of this here in Dallas with the cancellation of some high-profile building or conversion plans, and I expect there will be more.\n\nI hope my comments have been a good start on today’s proceedings. Subsequent speakers will, I am sure, provide more detailed information on Metroplex real estate trends. Before leaving, though, I want to remind you that North Texas owes its prosperity to the legions of vital and entrepreneurial businesswomen and men who grew up here or came here. People like you. You dare to dream. You are not afraid to take risks. You are a large part of what makes Dallas what it is.\n\nLet me put this in perspective. We read a lot these days about India and its barnstorming economy. India has an extraordinary cadre of brilliant and hardworking people. India’s economic prowess grabs a lot of headlines. And yet consider this: The 24 million people of Texas produce 20 percent more output than the 1.1 billion people of India. The Texas economy is a fifth larger than India’s. That’s because of hardworking risk takers like you. The Federal Reserve does its level best to maintain monetary conditions necessary for sustainable non-inflationary growth. But you, and the businessmen and women of America, are the ones that make that growth happen and secure our prosperity. God bless you."

        "content": "August 29, 2006 San Antonio, Texas\n\nMy name is Richard Fisher, and as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I want to thank you for joining me and my colleagues today for this informal community luncheon.\n\nI spent a great deal of time here in 1994 during what I have come to call my midlife crisis, when I lost control of my better judgment and ran for the U.S. Senate. Two positive things came out of my unsuccessful efforts on the campaign trail: First, Texans elected themselves a talented senator in Kay Bailey Hutchison; and second, well, about all I accomplished was the unique distinction of being the only person to eat at every Dairy Queen in the great state of Texas, including at the 21 DQs right here in Bexar County. I like to say that I labored in the vineyards of politics but all it yielded for me was prune juice. The truth is it yielded a lot of Blizzards, Dilly Bars and Dip Cones, and about 10 extra pounds.\n\nI am especially delighted to see Tom Frost in the audience today. Of course, you all know the special relationship Frost Bank has with San Antonio. Tom also has a very special relationship with the Dallas Fed and our branch office here in San Antonio. In keeping with his family tradition of being a friend to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Tom has been a trusted advisor to our bank since 1967, having served a total of 12 years on the boards of directors of our Dallas and San Antonio offices and another three and a half years on our Federal Advisory Council. And thanks to Tom, Dick Evans—the talented CEO of Cullen Frost—serves on our board today, always providing a keen and insightful view from San Antonio.\n\nSo rich is the Frost family’s involvement with the Dallas Fed that earlier generations served on our original organizing committee in 1914, after the Federal Reserve Act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913. Twelve Reserve Districts were to be set up around the country, with the Eleventh District to be headquartered in Dallas. When the San Antonio Branch opened in 1927, it was housed in leased office space in the Frost National Bank Building. The local newspaper thought that was pretty good stuff and wrote that having a Fed outpost here “had changed San Antonio from a financial water-hole to a financial roundup.”\n\nTom, thank you for being here today, and thank you for all you and your family have done to help the Federal Reserve, the Eleventh District, this city, our great state and our country.\n\nBefore lunch, I had the pleasure of meeting with the presidents of many of the banks located in the San Antonio and Austin metropolitan areas. They were kind enough to share their observations, impressions and concerns about what is happening in the local economy. I learned a great deal from their thoughtful comments. Both cities play important roles in promoting Texas’ economic health, and I have gained a better understanding of why they continue to grow faster than other parts of the state.\n\nThe local banking sector is doing very well. A total of 180 financial institutions operate in the greater Austin and San Antonio areas, with more than 850 branches holding $58 billon in assets. Just as important, 95 percent of these banks were profitable during the first half of this year. These banks report strong growth in loans for commercial real estate and construction and land development over the past four years.\n\nLet me say a word about Austin, as it appears to me that over time, from a commercial standpoint, the capital and San Antonio are increasingly blending together and playing off one another in just the right way. Austin is the state’s high-tech capital and a world leader in innovation. Austin’s second-quarter venture capital investment was more than double what it was a year ago, and the city ranks third in the country behind Silicon Valley and the Boston area in this vital measure of technological prowess. In a typical year, Austin residents and companies top all other tech centers except Silicon Valley in patents granted. Firms from around the country and around the world are relocating to Austin, attracted by the city’s well-educated and highly skilled workforce, advanced technological infrastructure and cost advantages. A recent survey by Expansion magazine ranked Austin as the most attractive city in the country for future business relocations.\n\nSan Antonio is booming. Amen. Employment has been growing at a healthy pace—at 4 percent last year—because of expansion in health care, financial services and manufacturing. When Toyota opens its new plant this fall, factory jobs will get another shot in the arm. The leisure and hospitality sector continues to provide a stable base for the local economy, and San Antonio is on track for one of its best convention years since 2001. Military spending has long been an important driver for San Antonio, and the National Security Agency’s new facility will have significant spillovers. Besides the obvious benefits to housing and retail, it will also boost education programs at the area’s universities.\n\nBut maybe we shouldn’t talk too much about the NSA. They might be listening.\n\nI don’t know whether the NSA is listening, but as you can see, the press is here, so you can bet that some one is listening. When I give a speech, I am aware that many come to extract clues about which way interest rates are going to move. I don’t expect today will be any different, so let me issue the usual disclaimer that I speak only for myself, not for the Federal Open Market Committee, nor for any of the other committee members. And let me assure you that I will consider this a successful speech if I manage to convey no clues whatsoever on the interest rate front.\n\nA couple of days ago, I told another audience that our economy is at a crossroads, an opinion that has not changed. Using the word “crossroads” brought to mind a story about William McChesney Martin, who served as Federal Reserve Board chairman longer than anyone, even Alan Greenspan. The Alfalfa Club is one of the great institutions in Washington, D.C. Once a year, it holds a dinner devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group is “Veni, Vidi, Defici,” a phrase loosely taken from the Latin for “I came, I saw, I lost.”\n\nBill Martin was nominated to run on the Alfalfa Party ticket in 1966, while serving as Fed chairman under his fourth president. In his acceptance speech, he announced in jest that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he was taking his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Martin continued, he would adopt a platform proclaiming that as a president he planned to “make life endurable again, by stamping out prosperity.”\n\n“I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel.” Martin told his audience that “America is at the crossroads. And I shall do everything I can do to keep it there.”\n\nMartin gave his Alfalfa Club speech 52 years after Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act and President Woodrow Wilson signed it into law so as to encourage, not stamp out, economic prosperity. One of the more successful and brilliant aspects of this legislation was the creation of the 12 regional banks. The Fed could have been set up solely in Washington, like so many other institutions of the central government. Having representatives from all parts of the country, however, brings a deeper, more diverse perspective (and occasional “conflicting counsel”!) to the policy debate at the meetings of the Open Market Committee when we collectively determine monetary policy, giving a clearer view of what is really happening in the U.S. economy. The regional banks maintain branch offices in cities within their district to stay in touch with local economic conditions and business leaders. Indeed, our view of things from Dallas is greatly enhanced by the efforts of our distinguished branch directors and outstanding staff in San Antonio, who keep a watchful eye on economic trends in the city, Austin and South Texas.\n\nOf course, the sexy bits of the Federal Reserve—or at least the stuff that the press and the markets seem to find seductive and just can’t seem to get enough of—deal with monetary policy. But to really understand us, you need to know a little about the businesses we operate as a part of the central bank of the United States. Let me tell you about the business of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, all derived from our charter to maintain and protect the monetary system our citizens rely on.\n\nI have the privilege of representing the more than 1,300 people who work at the Dallas Fed and our branches in San Antonio, Houston and El Paso. One of our duties is to process checks. We process 1 billion paper checks a year, worth about $900 billion. Every day, we handle 4.3 million paper checks. Processing these checks requires us to sort them into 1,748 different stacks, each belonging to a different bank in our district or other districts. Due to advances in technology, many banks now send us checks electronically in a digital format. We receive and process between 800,000 and 1.1 million electronic images each day. Not all banks have converted to electronic processing, so we have to re-create physical checks from the electronic images. On average, we print out 506,000 electronic checks each day and add them to our bank stacks.\n\nIn addition to processing checks, we provide the blood supply—the currency—that flows through the veins and capillaries of a sprawling district that, if it were a country, would be the 12th largest economy in the world, producing some 20 percent more output than India. We supply the liquidity banking customers need in good times and bad, and we work double time—overtime in times of trauma, such as Y2K, September 11, 2001, and last year’s devastating hurricanes—to keep the heart of the Texas economy pumping.\n\nEven in these days of credit and debit cards and electronic payments, you can’t overstate the importance of cash. When I was a student at Oxford, the great insurance magnate, Clement Stone, came to speak at the Oxford Union. A student asked him to kindly share with those of us in the audience what he considered the key to success. He looked out at the audience, curled up his Ronald Coleman mustache and said: “In one word: cash.” Well, the Dallas Fed stores and circulates a lot of it. Our main vault in Dallas is the size of a five-story building.\n\nIf you ever need to do your laundry or park at a meter, call me. Our vaults contain more than 150 million quarters.\n\nAnd lots of dollar bills. We distribute and receive 5.4 billion circulating banknotes each year, worth nearly $92 billion. That’s almost $400 million in cash passing through our offices every day. This is a thing of beauty to watch. The mammoth machines scan the cash at a rate of 90,000 bills per hour. They cull out about 825 counterfeit bills each month. They pluck out almost 40 million worn bills each month—valued at $517 million—and send them off to Money Heaven. The life span of a typical $1 bill, incidentally, is just 18 months. A $20 bill lasts four years, and a $100 bill lasts nine.\n\nAmong the regional banks’ other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our respective districts. We conduct on-site audits of our member banks and monitor bank performance and stability measures using electronic surveillance technologies. We have also launched public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community, and we host public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy.\n\nAnd we do serious economic research, designed to provide the intellectual heft for informed monetary policymaking. Our Research Department employs two dozen crack economists who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an associate of our research team in Dallas for the past 13 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\n\nWe have spread our research function to our branches. In addition to tracking trends across Texas, our economists here in San Antonio and in Houston and El Paso maintain a keen interest in Mexico and the many ways its economy commingles with ours. The reason is simple: Understanding Texas’ economy requires an appreciation of Mexico’s. The two are joined at the hip.\n\nI am encouraged by much of what I see on the economic front in Mexico. Its economy has been growing strongly for three years now. Preliminary estimates show that Mexico’s real GDP grew at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, and it would have been higher if so many Mexicans had not been on vacation for the Holy Week holidays. A total of 833,000 jobs were added to the formal sector in the first half of 2006, the fastest employment growth rate in nine years.\n\nThere are other positives. Inflation has been tamed. Mexico’s headline consumer price index has declined to about 3 percent, its lowest level in 30 years and below the rates recently reported in the U.S. The banking sector is thriving. Low interest rates, pent-up demand for consumer credit and mortgages and financial institutions’ greater willingness to lend has fueled a borrowing boom. Mexico’s banks expect loan growth of 25 percent in 2006. The peso is steady. More than a decade ago, Mexico quit the fool’s errand of trying to fix the value of its currency, and a free-floating peso has been a source of stability, not only in Mexico but in South Texas as well.\n\nWhat is most impressive to me, however, is how the international financial community has not retreated from Mexico, despite the turmoil and uncertainty surrounding the recent presidential election. Mexico’s risk premium seems to have settled to around 120 basis points over similar U.S. Treasury bonds. Foreign investors feel, as I do, that Mexico has come to understand the value of pursuing sound macroeconomic policies, cemented by the constitutional reforms that secured the independence of Banco de México in 1994. Indeed, at the retreat we just had in Jackson Hole last weekend with our colleagues from all over the world, the governor of the central bank, Guillermo Ortiz, noted their research has concluded that had Mexico had in place the mechanisms needed to avoid the policy mistakes they experienced in the 1970s through the mid-1990s, per capita income in Mexico would be some two-thirds larger than it is today. This kind of frank acknowledgment and determination to not go back to the bad old days shows a level of sophistication that undergirds market confidence.\n\nThis is not to say there is no room for improvements in Mexico. Without serious reforms to Mexico’s inadequate education system, rigid labor laws and poorly enforced contracts and property rights, the country will not live up to its full economic potential. But I believe that with each step Mexico takes toward these needed reforms, the benefits will become obvious on both sides of the border.\n\nAnother area where the researchers at the Dallas Fed are on the cutting edge involves the ongoing effort to better understand the phenomenon of inflation. To this end, we have developed a new way of measuring changes in prices that can assist monetary policymakers in assessing the direction and speed of approaching inflationary winds.\n\nI’m going to talk at length about inflation tomorrow in a speech in Dallas, but let me give you a quick brief on the subject.\n\nCentral bankers abhor inflation. We do so viscerally; it is part of our DNA. We know, just as all of you know, that inflation will eat away at an economy’s foundation by sapping the purchasing power of money and making less valuable those 5.4 billion bank notes that pass through our vaults. Once inflation gets a head of steam, it becomes difficult to bring back under control without a dose of harsh monetary medicine. Our job at the Fed is to make sure that does not happen, so the economy stands a better chance of achieving sustainable, long-term, non-inflationary growth.\n\nEvery business school grad knows you cannot control what you cannot measure. This applies to inflation as well as to the operations of any factory or office. You are all no doubt familiar with the Consumer Price Index, the CPI, which receives widespread coverage as it comes out each month. It measures the price changes for a basket of goods consumed by the typical urban American household over time.\n\nMany economists have lost confidence in the CPI as an inflation gauge. Objections have arisen about the goods included in the basket and the statistical weights assigned to each of them. In its place, many economists and monetary policymakers look at the personal consumption expenditure deflator, or PCE. The PCE doesn’t study a hypothetical basket of goods, but measures what we actually spend our money on.\n\nStandard PCE formulas come in two varieties. The first formula gives us the “headline” inflation number, which counts all the goods and services we buy. Weather and other temporary or seasonal conditions, however, often cause significant volatility in the prices of food and energy products, which clouds the picture when you are trying to judge longer term sustainable trends. Including these skittish items can produce a distorted picture, where real inflationary signals cannot be discerned because of statistical noise that might lead policymakers to faulty conclusions. To guard against this, analysts look at a PCE formula that excludes food and energy products, leaving what is called core inflation.\n\nThere are critics of reliance on this measure for the purposes of developing monetary policy. Many of you may have read in yesterday’s Financial Times or heard on National Public Radio that at Jackson Hole an official of the Bank of England had some pungent comments about the wisdom of removing energy from the PCE in an era of sustained upward movement in oil prices driven by new demand and the tectonic shifts that have taken place since China, India and others got on the stick. And other central banks take a very different approach.\n\nIn preparing for our deliberations at the FOMC, I have come to rely upon what is called the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator. This was developed by our own economics team under the leadership of a clever fellow named Jim Dolmas.\n\nInstead of routinely excluding food and energy, the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator recognizes that people have to eat, drive and air-condition their homes. Dramatic movements in food and energy prices may be a noisy distortion for econometricians, but these movements have a real impact on people’s consumption decisions. To be sure, a temporary blip in the prices of any of these essential goods should not be treated as permanent and might well distort one’s reading of underlying inflationary impulses. Indeed, in making policy, it strikes me as wise to be wary of any and all temporary distortions and to concentrate instead on underlying trends that condition expectations for future inflation. Thus, the Trimmed-Mean PCE sets aside whichever goods display the sharpest price movements up or down so that extreme—but temporary—price fluctuations do not obscure our vision.\n\nThe latest trimmed-mean readings are for June and suggest a base inflation rate of 2.7 percent for the previous 12 months.\n\nThe business of getting it right on inflation is not an easy task. I keep a close eye on all of the inflation measures—especially now, when high energy prices and utility bills are putting pressure on many businesses to raise prices. But I put extra weight on the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator because I believe it provides a more realistic picture of the price pressures in the economy and more accurately measures what conditions the operations of our economy.\n\nI would like for you to be aware of one other item on our research agenda. I came to the Dallas Fed with a belief that we cannot truly understand price pressures in the U.S. without taking into account developments outside the country. Just as Mexico is joined at the hip with Texas and Texas is part of the United States, the U.S. economy is inextricably linked with the rest of the world. I know this viscerally as a former trade negotiator. But our linkage with the rest of the world goes beyond just the import of goods and services and the standard textbook formula for adding net exports to the calculation of our gross domestic product. U.S. businesses source product and processes and tasks to wherever they can be secured at the lowest cost and with the greatest efficacy, whether it is in San Antonio or Shanghai. And the capital markets that businesses and governments depend upon to finance their operations are truly globalized, operating 24/7. This all affects the gearing of our businesses and the overall gearing of the U.S. economy. We can see this with the naked eye.\n\nHowever, we do not really know just how this heightened interlinkage with the rest of the world should affect the making of monetary policy at the Federal Reserve. And so the Dallas Fed has taken upon itself the job of contemplating how globalization impacts us. We have only just started our work on this front, but we have begun to observe some aspects of globalization that impact economic activity and price movements on our front porch.\n\nFor example, we know that capacity utilization abroad is rising, a trend that may well have implications for our inflation rate here at home. The U.S. economy, of course, remains a Goliath, producing roughly a quarter of the world’s output. So when our economy slows, it takes some steam out of the global engine. Other economies, however, have retooled and restructured to rid themselves of impediments that had been retarding growth for the past decade or more—in the case of China, since Mao took power in the 1940s, or in India, since the days of the Raj.\n\nThe changes have started to pay big dividends. The European Union economies are growing at rates not seen in some six years. For the first time in a decade, industry surveys in Japan, the world’s second-largest economy, are finding capacity constraints. China’s second-quarter growth came in at 11.3 percent, the fastest yet in an already remarkable decade and another indication that this emerging giant may be straining at its capacity. And India has been clocking growth rates over 8 percent.\n\nA global boom has been under way for four years now, ignited in no small degree by the easy monetary policy that began in 2001. There was a bit of a lag before it kicked in, but when it did, it kicked in big-time all over the world. Global GDP has been growing at roughly a 5 percent annual rate, eclipsing the U.S. average of 4 percent. Excess global capacity has been increasingly absorbed, even as capitalists rush to retool and expand that capacity.\n\nTaken together, these developments suggest the relationship between supply and demand for inputs of all sorts is becoming tighter, a fact of life our businesswomen and men are encountering on a daily basis as they search the globe for the inputs they need to keep production up and costs down.\n\nWe all know about the boom in commodity prices. Let me give you another example of how global growth is affecting resource utilization. According to a shipping industry leader, some of the world’s fleet of large, ocean-going ships are being pulled into duty moving bulk cargo from one Chinese port to another. It may be that only 1 or 2 percent of the fleet has been reassigned to China, but daily shipping rates have been rising at a time of the year when they’re usually softening. They are roughly two times what they were a year ago. It now costs more for importers to ship goods to the U.S., an illustration of how global growth can impact prices here at home.\n\nWe are going to see more of this, not less, as the rest of the world continues to adapt.\n\nOf course, economic theories and models dealing with global influences have been around for hundreds of years. We have David Ricardo, Francis Edgeworth, Paul Samuelson and many others to thank for setting the economics profession on an ever-improving path for better understanding the global aspects of economics. I would posit, immodestly, that the models and analytical tools used by the Federal Reserve are some of the most sophisticated and practicable ever developed. The problem is that our tool kit needs to continue expanding to deal with today’s rapidly changing manifestation of globalization. Tremendous complexity is required to capture the sophisticated working and resulting impacts of the changes we are experiencing, and we need to continue to push the envelope in order to fully understand how to make monetary policy in the world that is and will be rather than the world that was."

        "content": "August 16, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nI was really enjoying that introduction until you had to be thorough and remind this great group of folks of my midlife crisis: my run for the United States Senate in 1994. All is well that ends well. We have a great senator in Kay Bailey Hutchison, and I am much happier at the Federal Reserve, which, thankfully, is a million miles from the world of partisan politics. Amen.\n\nBy raising politics, though, you’ve reminded me of the Alfalfa Club and given me a bridge to what I want to talk about today.\n\nThe Alfalfa Club is one of the great Washington institutions. It holds a dinner every year that is devoted solely to poking fun at the political pretensions of the day. Tongue firmly in cheek, the club nominates a candidate to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. Of course, none of them ever win. Nominees are thenceforth known for evermore as members of the Stassen Society, named for Harold Stassen, who ran for president nine times and lost every time, then ran a tenth time on the Alfalfa ticket and lost again. The motto of the group, which I adopted after only one outing to describe my own misplaced run for the Senate, is “Veni, Vidi, Defici,” which is loosely taken from the Latin for “I came, I saw, I lost.”\n\nSeveral of our fellow Texans have had the dubious honor of receiving the Alfalfa nomination, among them John Connally, Bob Strauss and Lloyd Bentsen, and also, well before they were elected president in the real deal, both “Bush 41” and our current president.\n\nAmong the alumni of the Stassen Society dearest to my heart is William McChesney Martin. Bill Martin holds the record for serving the longest as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board—even longer than Alan Greenspan. In 1966, while serving as Fed chairman under his fourth president, Martin was nominated to run for the presidency on the Alfalfa Party ticket. In his acceptance speech, he announced in jest that, given his proclivities as a central banker, he was taking his cues from the German philosopher Goethe, “who said that people could endure anything except continual prosperity.” Therefore, Bill Martin announced, if he were to adopt a political platform as a presidential candidate, he planned to “make life endurable again, by stamping out prosperity.” “I shall conduct the administration of the country,” he said, “exactly as I have so successfully conducted the affairs of the Federal Reserve. To that end, I shall assemble the best brains that can be found…ask their advice on all matters…and completely confound them by following all their conflicting counsel…. I say to you that America is at the crossroads. And I shall do everything I can do to keep it there.” [1]\n\nPundits and commentators have been bombarding you with interpretations of the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), where committee members collectively decided to not raise the federal funds rate after having done so 17 consecutive times in quarter-point increments. These same commentators are also spending a great deal of time and space divining the intentions of our committee under the new chairmanship of Ben Bernanke. With all that analysis floating around, I thought I would share with you today my own views on the present predicament of the economy and monetary policy, as one of the 18 individuals who sit at that table offering “conflicting counsel” to the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn suffering through all this, please remember that I speak only for myself as one participant on the FOMC. I speak only for the view from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, not for the committee or for any of the other Bank presidents and governors on the committee. Each of us always speaks as an individual, and I adhere to that convention today.\n\nLet us start with the real estate markets, the subject nearest and dearest to your hearts.\n\nCommercial real estate markets have generally returned to more normal conditions since the boom-bust at the start of this century. After falling in the early 2000s, for example, apartment rents have risen moderately, first in high-home-price coastal areas of the country and later in inland areas such as Dallas. Retail rents have more than recovered from the declines of the early part of the decade, particularly on the East and West coasts. By the end of 2005 they were rising at a 5 to 6 percent pace in cities like Dallas and Houston. And national office rents have been rising moderately in nominal terms, as office vacancy rates have been absorbed by an expanding economy. All told, commercial market rents have recently been rising in an expanding national economy and have shifted from a disinflationary to a slightly re-inflationary factor affecting the U.S. economy.\n\nAlthough rents have risen, prices for commercial properties have risen by more, perhaps reflecting the ample amount of liquidity in the capital markets looking for a place to be invested. In plain English, a lot of moola is out there chasing a limited number of sustainable projects. The result is that capitalization rates have been pushed down, raising concern among some industry analysts, especially in a condominium market that seems to reflect a disconnect between demand and supply at the margin. We have seen the effect locally with the cancellation of some high-profile building or conversion plans, and I expect there will be more.\n\nThe key area of concern in the real estate markets is the housing market. You know the facts here, so I’ll make this brief by repeating what a friend who has been a major homebuilder since 1973 recently told me: “This is the roughest, most sudden correction we have ever seen in the housing market.”\n\nIt may comfort you to know that of all the markets in America, Texas’ is among the most resilient. In fact, so far this year, single-family permits are up 11 percent from their year-ago pace—the third fastest growth rate among the 50 states and a sharp contrast to the 7 percent year-to-date decline for the U.S. as a whole. Much of our state’s strength reflects the pro-growth climate and low land prices that Texas has to offer.\n\nBut in making monetary policy for the nation, this provides scant comfort for the Federal Reserve. Nationwide, single-family permits are down 26 percent from the peak last September. We are well aware that consumption drives 70 percent of the nation’s economic growth and that a significant slug of the purchasing power of consumers has in the last few years been greatly enhanced by refinancing their mortgages in a rising-price market. During an expansion homebuilders propel the economy forward by creating jobs and buying lumber and other inputs. So we are watching the effect of the inventory correction in housing with due regard for its gravity. Builders are responding as one would expect: They are cutting staff, renegotiating prices and getting concessions from subcontractors, and either walking away from or renegotiating planned land purchases and other contracts. This is disinflationary activity that impacts economic growth.\n\nThere is one factor that distinguishes this housing market correction from previous ones, in addition to its suddenness and depth. The industry has consolidated since the last great correction in 1991. Fewer big builders now account for more of the market. Compared with smaller builders, they have larger and more diverse customer bases, stronger balance sheets and better inventory controls. As a consequence, they build fewer spec homes, they are quicker to adjust the pace of new construction, and they have enough financial strength to cut prices in reaction to inventory upswings. As a result, the inventory cycle may not be as severe as it was in the 1970s and early 1980s. The big builders also have strong balance sheets and ready accessibility to capital from a sound banking system and frisky private equity groups. As a result, the industry will be better positioned to meet the housing needs of Americans when the homebuying climate eventually improves.\n\nBut it is clear from my perch on the economic tree that the housing downturn and the cumulative effect of energy and electricity price increases and higher interest rates, among other factors, are definitely having an impact on the consumer.\n\nTake restaurants, for example, a sector Dallasites know better than most because we have more restaurants per capita than any other city in America. Nationwide, the industry has seen overall “guest counts” decline and has experienced a downward shift in price points, while the costs of utilities and other inputs have soared. This is noteworthy for an industry that employs some 12.5 million workers and feeds 130 million people nationwide every day, and is illustrative of a shift in the tenor of the economy.\n\nThe net effect of the correction in housing and the rise in the costs of transportation and of heating and air-conditioning our homes has been a slowdown in the U.S. economy. After all, it grew at 5.8 percent in the first quarter of this year, a remarkable growth rate for an economy our size. Let me give you some math here. Last year, the gross domestic product of the U.S. economy was about $13 trillion. Had we continued to grow at that annualized rate for the second quarter, we would have produced an additional $377 billion of goods and services in just six months, so large and so strong and so dynamic is the U.S. economy.\n\nFor the past few years, I have referred to the U.S. as a supercharged monster roadster that has trouble keeping its speed of growth within the limits posted by economic doctrine. Recently, the economy has downshifted, and the speedometer on our dashboard has shown a deceleration as it turned the corner from the first quarter to the second. I expect second-quarter GDP growth to be revised upward to closer to 3 percent. And my best guess one month and two weeks into the third quarter is that the speed at which we are now proceeding is roughly of that magnitude. From my vantage point, despite what you hear from some of the Eeyores in the analytical community, a recession is not visible on the horizon.\n\nLet’s not forget, the last economic expansion lasted 10 years. The expansion before that lasted nearly as long. Recessions are becoming less frequent and less severe—in no small part owing to increased global interconnectedness.\n\nWhile the speedometer indicates that the economy is growing—albeit at a slower, more sustainable pace—the problem is that the inflation pressure gauge needle is moving the other way. There is a definite increase in inflationary momentum, though like many in this room, I was delighted to see in this morning’s release a reversal of the recent surge in apparel prices as reported in the headline CPI for July.\n\nAll of the relevant measurements of inflation have shown a pickup in inflation over the first half of the year. This pickup shows up in the measure of price movements in consumer expenditures excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE. Inflation is also seen in the median CPI calculated by the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. And we see it in the Trimmed-Mean PCE calculated by our team at the Dallas Fed.\n\nThe differences in these key inflation measures may seem obscure to you, so let me slice this pie another way: When you dissect the components of the PCE, whether trimmed or fully garbed, you find prices increasing in 82 percent of the components measured in June, up from 73 percent in April. That means that at the end of the second quarter, only 18 percent of prices were steady or falling, as opposed to 27 percent two months earlier.\n\nWe also know that economic developments occurring outside the United States are not as readily offsetting domestic price pressures here as they were before. The Dallas Fed has taken it upon itself to better understand how globalization impacts the conduct of U.S. monetary policy. We have only just begun our work on this front, but this much we know: Capacity utilization abroad is rising. This is true in all the member states of the European Union, which are growing their economies at rates not seen in some six years. Recent revisions in the U.K.’s national accounts indicate the Brits are operating closer to capacity. For the first time in over a decade, industry surveys in Japan, the world’s second-largest economy, are reporting capacity constraints.[2] And we all know that China reported second-quarter growth of 11.3 percent, the fastest yet in an already remarkable decade, continuing to press the envelope of what they can produce without bumping into constraints.\n\nAll of which means that as our businesswomen and men search the globe for inputs into the products they produce, the relationship between supply and demand for those inputs is becoming tighter.\n\nYou see a lot of discussion in news columns about the boom in commodity prices. Let me give you another example of how global economic growth is affecting resource utilization. According to one shipping industry leader, a portion of the international fleet of large ships that carries bulk goods across the major oceans—the so-called Panamax-size ships—is being absorbed to service coastal intra-Chinese trade. It may be that only 1 or 2 percent of this fleet has been so reassigned, but it is noteworthy that at a time of year when the daily rates on these ships usually soften, rates have actually risen over the past month and are now roughly two times what they were a year ago. As a result, it costs more for importers to ship goods to the United States for consumption here. This illustrates how global economic growth impacts the prices paid here at home.\n\nTo be sure, the U.S. economy is the world’s biggest. We produce roughly a quarter of the world’s output. So when our economy slows, it takes some steam out of the global engine. Yet in recent years, other economies have been retooled and restructured so as to pull themselves out of the slump they had experienced over the past decade or more—in the case of China, since Mao took power in the 1940s. The changes these countries have engineered have started to pay big dividends in terms of growth. As a result, the U.S. economy is an increasingly smaller part of a larger, more intensely interconnected global economy. Increasing connectedness forces changes in the gearing of our economy.\n\nLet me dwell on this for a minute in the context of our recent FOMC meeting. First, let me assure you that there are no hawks and there are no doves on the committee. I see only owls: 19 men and women who are doing their level best to devise a wise and considered policy aimed at fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate of providing the monetary conditions that foster sustainable, non-inflationary growth.\n\nThe committee decided in our last meeting that it was timely to pause, in significant part because of the lags in time it takes for the tightening measures the committee had taken over the previous 17 meetings to affect the economy’s inflationary impulses.\n\nThis matter of lagged effects of previous policy initiatives is complex but crucial to your understanding of what we noodle through. Even if the U.S. were an isolated economy, there would be long lags between the time monetary policy is tightened and the slowing of the economy and inflation. And, mind you, the economy traditionally slows before inflation comes down.\n\nFrom my perspective, the dynamics of this important issue of lags is impacted by globalization. Just a few years ago, the global economy was in a slump and the U.S. economy was growing slowly as it emerged from the dot-com bust. Under those conditions, with an abundance of productive resources throughout the world, output here and elsewhere could expand with little or no inflationary pressure. The easy monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve between January 2001 and June 2004, and by other central banks worldwide, helped get that expansion going.\n\nA global boom has been under way for the past four years, aided in no small degree by the easy monetary policy that began in 2001. There was a lag before it kicked in, but when it did, it kicked in big-time all over the world. Global GDP has been growing at roughly a 5 percent annual rate, above the 4 percent average recent yearly rate in the U.S. This means that the rest of the world has grown faster than the United States. Excess global capacity has been increasingly absorbed, even as capitalists rush to retool and expand capacity. Inflationary pressures have risen, as evidenced by leaps in commodity prices and the example of shipping prices that I gave you a few minutes ago.\n\nOf late, central banks around the world, including the Fed, have been reining in the accommodation they provided as a spur to global growth. With global growth running stronger than U.S. growth, I would submit that more monetary policy tightening than usual was necessary to slow U.S. growth and inflation because we have been dealing with the lagged effects of the easy monetary policy that spurred the current global growth surge. This is why I supported every one of the increases in the fed funds rate that has been voted on since I joined the Fed over a year ago.\n\nI would also suggest that further globalization will alter the dynamics that govern the lags in our policy initiatives, although I am not yet sure just how they will change. They may become longer, increasing the time it takes for the consequences of Fed tightening measures to take hold.\n\nSimultaneously, I am conscious of the fact that there are other ways globalization changes how markets react to and, in turn, impact monetary policy. So as not to try your patience, let me whip quickly through some of these for the sake of giving you some insight into what vexes central bankers.\n\nNormally, short- and long-term interest rates move in the same direction. When short-term rates rise, so do longer-term rates, and vice versa. This is what analysts refer to when they speak of a positively shaped, or upward sloping, yield curve in a healthy economy. They fret when they see a flat or negatively sloped yield curve because they fear this presages an economic slowdown as investors reach out to lock in the yields on longer maturities. However, recently the globalization of capital markets, combined with a glut of savings outside the U.S., has kept U.S. long-term rates low and steady, despite our healthy economic growth. Short-term rates have risen, but long-term rates have not. The low level of long-term rates makes financial conditions easier than what would be inferred from the movement toward higher short-term rates. This in and of itself may well have lengthened the lags of the impact from tightening monetary policy.\n\nThe point is, the changes we have witnessed in the global economy over the past few years and the phenomenon of globalization matter in that they affect several channels through which both the timing and degree of the impact of monetary policy have been altered.\n\nNow, let me bring this closer to home. Price inflation usually does not become entrenched unless accompanied by wage inflation. Until recently, the productivity of U.S. workers was advancing at the same pace as wages and benefits costs. In the last few months, however, the anecdotal evidence picked up through the Fed’s Beige Book—the survey conducted eight times a year by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of businesses in their districts—and the anecdotal evidence the Bank presidents and their staffs glean from their conversations with CEOs and other business operators all indicate an emerging and widening shortage of skilled and semiskilled workers, along with attendant upward wage pressures. This has finally begun to show up in the wage, productivity and unit labor cost statistics.\n\nIn addition to studying the numbers and consulting the remarkably comprehensive econometric models of the Federal Reserve staff and other analysts, each of the participants on the FOMC is in regular contact with the people who are in the field hands-on, operating the nation’s businesses.\n\nFor example, I have a habit of regularly consulting the CEOs of 35 or so major U.S. and global companies. This was something taught to me 30 years ago by my mentor, Robert Roosa. He used to say that no chef achieves success only by following the formulae of recipe books; they also have to use their taste buds. The CEOs and other operators of the real economy that we consult are the taste buds in our effort to assist in serving up the right monetary policy. To be sure, one has to be careful with anecdotal evidence, but one thing is very noticeable of late, at least from my consultations. A year ago, the CEOs’ constant refrain was: Competitive forces will not allow me to raise prices. In the past few months, however, more of them are reporting the ability to raise prices, with decreasing customer resistance.\n\nThis phenomenon of real or perceived growing pricing power introduces yet another set of lags into the monetary policy system. Once the perception of having pricing power becomes entrenched, it is difficult to alter. This is a psychological, as well as an economic phenomenon. Behaviors become habits, and habits are hard to change. This is why it is critical for monetary policy to not encourage these emerging pricing behaviors. Keep in mind, it is not just sellers whose pricing behavior is changing; it is customers’ as well.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that we appear indeed to be at something of a crossroads in the economy and in the conduct of monetary policy. The U.S. economy is slowing from its unsustainable, blistering pace of earlier this year. The rest of the global economy is picking up steam, despite our slowdown. We expect that the lagged effects of our actions and those of other central banks to tighten policy will begin to tamp down the inflationary impulses we have witnessed of late. But, frankly, nobody knows with precision how the dynamics of the global economy affect these lags or the practicability of our policies. At least I don’t.\n\nSo, here is the bottom line: In determining future policy, my colleagues and I will watch and listen and “taste” the indicators carefully as they come in. And, as we said at the conclusion of our last FOMC meeting, we will act accordingly. If anybody tells you with absolute conviction that the Fed is done raising interest rates or with equal conviction that they have only paused and will raise rates more starting in September or October, remind yourself that at best—and I’m being generous here—they are only guessing.\n\nI want to conclude by reminding you that the enemy of sustainable growth, and the enemy of every person in this room, the enemy of all the people—the poor, those who are retired or living on fixed incomes, the savers and the rich investors—is inflation. Inflation is the Lex Luthor of the Superman economy that is the United States. It is a sinister force that has the capacity to charm and romance the heck out of you but in the end wreaks only havoc.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will not tolerate inflation. But that doesn’t mean we need to take a sledgehammer to the economy. Going back to Bill Martin’s spoof speech at the Alfalfa Club, I assure you that we have no desire to take a cue from Goethe and conduct a policy that eliminates prosperity. We endeavor to underwrite economic prosperity. And if we see, after this pause, that inflation is beginning to threaten economic prosperity, we will take deliberate and, hopefully, owlish measures to counter it, so that the U.S. economy will continue to prosper."

        "content": "June 14, 2006 Corpus Christi, Texas\n\nThe Latin root of the word “credit” is credo: I believe. As Jackson Lears wrote in Sunday’s New York Times Magazine: “Faith [is] a necessary component of most transactions in an expanding economy.” I do not know whether faith can move mountains—that is, of course, a matter of faith—but I know well the importance of faith in the great economic machinery that meshes the growing of wheat in West Texas, the making of semiconductors in North Texas, the distilling of petrochemicals on the Gulf Coast and the movement of the ships at sea that call on the nation’s sixth busiest port here in Corpus Christi.\n\nFaith is certainly the basis of your confidence in the Federal Reserve. I have spoken in previous speeches of our “faith-based currency,” a term I use only slightly tongue in cheek. The dollar—like the euro, the yen, the British pound and other currencies—is what economists call a fiat currency. It is backed only by the federal government’s power to raise the revenues needed to meet its obligations and by the rectitude of the U.S. central bank. If the market were to lose faith in either assumption, the dollar would be debased.\n\nIt is not my place to comment on Congress’ business. With the acquiescence of its constituents, including the people in this room, the fiscal authorities have leveraged the U.S. government’s balance sheet by incurring structural liabilities exceeding projected revenues to an unprecedented degree. Economists and public policy analysts have myriad solutions for restoring balance to what they see as a highly leveraged—some would say overleveraged—American ledger. Congress, as keeper of the government’s purse and the sole body with the power to tax and spend the people’s money, has the duty and the means to impose solutions to these imbalances.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has a different duty, performed by different means. We are charged with maintaining the monetary conditions for sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. This task takes on heightened meaning in an era of highly leveraged government finances, for we must work overtime to sustain the faith.\n\nI am hardly an impartial observer, but I would submit that the Fed has done its job reasonably well. The numbers provide proof: Our $13 trillion economy has been barreling along at remarkable rates of growth for a sustained period without giving rise to inflation.\n\nWe must continue to do our job.\n\nWe know how close we came to creating an economic catastrophe when the Fed took its eye off the ball in the 1970s. And we remember the enmity the Federal Open Market Committee incurred when, under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker, it so dramatically took away the punchbowl of grain alcohol that was fueling reckless economic behavior. We never again want to be placed in the position of either promiscuous accomplice to fiscal impropriety or dour party pooper.\n\nToday, we labor under far more favorable conditions. Economic growth has been strong and prolonged. Employment is at an all-time high. And yet we have resisted monetizing Congress’ spendthrift ways. Money supply growth has thus far been tapered down without jeopardizing economic growth and has restrained inflationary impulses.\n\nBut no Fed official can ever afford to become complacent. The surest way to jeopardize the goodwill earned through the Volcker and Greenspan years would be for the FOMC to brook any behavior that might fan the embers of inflation. We can ill afford to somehow encourage expectations that inflation might gain momentum. For in today’s monetary realm, with markets so fluid and swift, expectations can quickly become reality.\n\nIn the marketplace, the working assumption is that the FOMC has a comfort zone for inflation, one that is quantifiable. According to this assumption, it is precisely quantifiable by a metric known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures deflator, stripped of energy and food prices, or the “PCE, ex-energy and food.”\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we rely on a different inflation metric, what we call the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator. Each month, it sets aside the prices that rose sharply and those that fell a lot, so that temporary inflationary and deflationary developments do not distort our sense of underlying trends. The Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator captures mainstream inflationary impulses. It ignores the extremes and recognizes that people have to eat, drive and air-condition their homes.\n\nOf late, the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator has been running at a rate of 2.4 percent, about 30 basis points higher than the PCE ex-energy and food. A compounding of 2.4 percent over a decade cuts the purchasing power of a dollar to 79 cents. Of course, it is reckless to extrapolate historical numbers. But this 2.4 percent rate is disarmingly close to one of the market’s key indicators of inflationary expectations—the spread between rates paid on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, and ordinary Treasury bonds of 10-year maturity. Another indicator of inflationary expectations is a consumer survey conducted by the University of Michigan. In May, those polled said they expected inflation over the next five to 10 years to run at 3.2 percent a year. One always has to question whether a survey of 500 people, no matter how scientific, actually reflects overall inflationary expectations. Yet again, one turns to the math: Over a decade, 3.2 percent yearly would reduce the value of a dollar to 73 cents. To me, this is more than discomforting. It is unacceptable.\n\nTo perform the duty you expect of me, I need to be relentlessly bird-dogging inflation to prevent a debasement of your dollars. I have done this by supporting each increase of the federal funds rate agreed to by the FOMC since I joined the committee over a year ago.\n\nThis business of getting it right on inflation is by no means an easy task. Econometricians do their utmost to provide us with accurate metrics, such as the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator and the PCE ex-energy, ex-food. But we have yet to quantify the unquantifiable: the psychology of the marketplace.\n\nI just attended my 35th college reunion. When I went off to school, my old-fashioned Norwegian mother, worried that Harvard professors in that heyday of radicalism might lead me astray, slipped a quotation into my pocket that read: “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect: it should not be surrendered to the first comer.” That sums up the Norwegian psyche as well as anything (even if it was borrowed from the decidedly un-Norwegian George Santayana!). Despite the fact that my genetic makeup was leavened by my Australian father’s more ebullient and trusting gene pool, I have carried that original clipping with me all these years, and today, 37 years later, it is taped to my desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\n“Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect” may seem a bit quaint in the age of Paris Hilton and Anna Nicole Smith, but I think it is a useful maxim for those assigned the dull and decidedly unsexy task of conducting monetary policy. We must always suspect the precision of numbers, even as we allow ourselves to be guided by them. And we must be ever watchful for influences that might throw off the accuracy of our econometric compasses.\n\nSo, against that background, how do I see the economy through the circumspect eyes of the Dallas Fed?\n\nAs far back as February, I suggested in a speech in London that first-quarter economic growth would exceed the 4 percent consensus guesstimate then circulating among economists. The latest revision of the GDP number came in at 5.3 percent.\n\nSince March, our Dallas team has been reporting a rotation of the impulses for growth, with business investment in plant and equipment accelerating significantly due to the confidence of corporations in their financial wherewithal and the need for capital expansion to meet projected needs, including continual cost efficiencies. Our economists have viewed this as a partial but not insignificant offset to weakness in the housing market. Despite the rising price of gasoline, our business contacts indicate that consumers continue to buy, but at a lesser clip.\n\nThe bottom line on growth is that we see it beginning to slow from its torrid pace of the first quarter. Let me remind you that we grew at a 5.3 percent annualized rate in those first three months of the year. In our $13 trillion economy, a 5.3 percent growth rate, sustained for a year, would mean incremental growth of $690 billion, an amount equal to the entire output of India or the combined output of Indonesia, Ireland and … my ancestral Norway. If the economy achieves the current Wall Street consensus of 3.5 percent growth for 2006, that would mean increasing GDP by $394 billion, a healthy pace for a gargantuan economy in its fifth year of expansion.\n\nThe numbers I cite are adjusted for inflation. That is, they are “real,” in the sense they are uncontaminated by inflation. The surest way to undermine the real growth rate we foresee from our perch in Dallas would be for inflationary expectations to take hold and begin distorting the spending and investment behavior of consumers and businesses.\n\nAgainst the background of sustained high prices for oil and gasoline and the inevitable propensity of sellers of goods and services to try to pass on cost increases, the brow begins to furrow in contemplating the inflation picture. On the one hand, I know that the Trimmed-Mean PCE Deflator is running at a rate that is just too corrosive to be accepted by a virtuous central banker. But I also know, having been party to it, of the incremental tightenings to which we have been subjecting the base interest rate. And I am fully aware that there is a lag between the time we tighten the valve and the time the impact of that tightening is felt.\n\nMind you, I am not sure we can measure this lag effect with great precision. This is partly due to our imperfect understanding of globalization’s effect on the gearing of our economy—an imperfection we at the Dallas Fed have dedicated ourselves to repairing, if not eliminating. It may also have to do with how markets have discounted the kind of titration* that occurs with the removal of previous monetary stimulus through 16 quarter-percentage-point increases in the federal funds rate, as opposed to less frequent or more dramatic moves.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that conducting monetary policy is as much an art as it is a science. We listen and watch and sniff the sounds and sights and smells of the economy as much as we measure with our advanced, constantly improving but nonetheless imperfect, econometric tool kit.\n\nI am but one voice behind the closed doors of the room where the FOMC deliberates. When called upon by the Chairman for my reading of the economy and my recommendations, I am constantly guided by my mother's advice, especially when it comes to contemplating inflation: I believe it safest to err on the side of skepticism. I cannot speak for my 18 brethren in that room, but I have noticed that each of them harbors a tendency towards Norwegian-like angst. And while this tendency of central bankers may at times be nervous-making for some of you, I believe you would lose faith in us if we conducted our business in any other way.\n\n*I have been eager to use this word ever since high school chemistry. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to finally do so."

        "content": "May 22, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nIt is a pleasure to address the Dallas Assembly. I was a member of the Assembly during the 1980s when I was young enough to qualify for it, and I am delighted to see that it is as spry and active as ever.\n\nI am also delighted to see Stuart Bumpas sitting in the audience—one of Dallas’ most distinguished lawyers—less spry but no less wry. Stuart is uniquely wise. When I was licking my wounds from my midlife crisis—running for the U.S. Senate in 1994—he gave me the perfect restorative: a first edition of P. G. Wodehouse’s The Code of the Woosters. It was the Doubleday Doran first printing of 1938, which I added to the 30-odd works of Wodehouse I had been collecting since my undergraduate days.\n\nMany of you may not be familiar with Wodehouse, the creator of Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, among countless comedic figures. He wrote over 70 novels, some 300 short stories, 18 plays, and, with Jerome Kern and other greats of the musical theater, the book for more than 30 musical comedies. Evelyn Waugh, George Orwell, John le Carré and almost every other writer of his day considered Wodehouse the single best writer of the English language.\n\nI am old-fashioned enough that I still read and reread Wodehouse, in order to keep a whimsical balance to an otherwise too-serious life. And being a money man at heart, I display Code of the Woosters, Stuart’s gift, prominently among my Wodehouse collection. It trades at around $800 in rare book circles. Which effectively means I am the first Texan in history to actually take money off a lawyer.\n\nWodehouse once set out to read all of Shakespeare. “But you know how it is,” he wrote. “Just as you have got Hamlet and Macbeth under your belt, and are preparing to read the stuffing out of Henry the Sixth … something of Agatha Christie’s catches your eye and you weaken.”\n\nToday, you are going to get the hard stuff, not the Agatha Christie or a more modern version or anything else that might be remotely titillating or of immediate gratification. Were I trendy, I suppose I could remind you that in the devout culture of central bankers, every numerary wears the cilice of inflation on his or her intellectual thigh as we pursue our avowed goal of providing the monetary conditions for sustainable non-inflationary economic growth. But there is nothing new or mysterious there. That has always gone with the territory and always will.\n\nWhat is new is the way in which globalization is affecting the gearing of our economy and what an increasingly integrated world means for operating the levers and pulleys of monetary policy. I want to share some personal thoughts on this important subject with you today, for it is what the Dallas Fed research team and I spend a great deal of time grappling with.\n\nI know many of you are eager for some clue about the latest direction of interest rates or some tidbit that might be turned to profit. I will do my best to disappoint you on that front. It was not for nothing that New York Times columnist Bill Safire taunted the Fed a few weeks ago for being coy when those who watch us want a full frontal view. He referred to us as “the House of Hints,” which, being old-fashioned, I consider totally complimentary.\n\nShould I impart any hints at all today, please bear in mind that I am speaking strictly in a personal capacity. I speak neither for my Fed colleagues nor for the other participants in the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nA little over a week ago, I beetled off to Argentina. After meetings and a speech at the Argentine central bank, my wife Nancy and I visited what we believe to be the eighth natural wonder of the world. On the speck of the map where Argentina touches Brazil and Paraguay is a little place called Cataratas del Iguazú. Surrounded by hundreds of miles of rain forest and dense jungle, Mother Nature created there the most beautiful waterfalls imaginable. No town is within miles of this place. And no economic activity invades its pristine scenery, except for ecotourism. So I was astonished when my BlackBerry started buzzing. Harvey Rosenblum, the Dallas Fed’s research director, needed an answer to something or other. There I was, in the middle of a South American jungle, thumbing out an e-mail so work could get done thousands of miles away.\n\nPicture that in your mind’s eye—and kindly ignore the image of my Nancy’s annoyance!\n\nBeing able to work almost anytime from almost anyplace is globalization at work. Technology, capital, labor and ideas, now able to move at unprecedented speed across national boundaries, have integrated the world to an unprecedented degree.\n\nImagine if this had been 10 years ago and I had been manager of a manufacturing operation or a retailer or a service provider that was malfunctioning in my absence. Imagine the painful and slow process that would have been required to ask and answer that question. Operations would have had to shut down for hours or even days as the folks here waited for me to return from vacation or at least reach my hotel, where I could receive a phone call or fax and transmit my decision back to Dallas. My company’s profitability would have been hurt, and the nation’s GDP would have taken a slight hit.\n\nWith BlackBerry in hand in today’s wireless, interconnected world, it made scant difference whether I was in the jungles of Iguazú or here in my office.\n\nIn this and countless other ways, globalization is reconfiguring the economic engine of America. Our citizens and companies do not seek to utilize inputs that are shipped over the surface of the sea or through cyberspace from faraway places for the sheer adventure of it or to brag that their BlackBerry works even in Iguazú. They do it because it makes them better off; because it enhances efficiency. This is the natural process of capitalism as it spreads across the world at brushfire speed, blown hither and yon by the incessant desire of businesswomen and men to drive down costs, make greater profits and grow their enterprises, and in doing so, raise the bottom line for the world economy—a higher GWP.\n\nLet me give you a few numbers that illustrate the breadth and depth of the world’s march toward globalization:\n\nFrom these data alone, it is clear that globalization unleashes competition and accelerates the forces of creative destruction, to borrow the term coined by the great economist Joseph Schumpeter.\n\nIn this turbulent sea of change, there are challenges and opportunities. Business leaders, like many of you here, confront them every day. The men and women who manage America’s businesses—the busy fingers of Adam Smith’s fabled invisible hand—work 24/7 to hone their companies’ productivity and competitiveness. They get it. They understand that America’s workers and businesses prosper by tapping into the opportunities inherent in a hyper-interconnected, integrated world.\n\nI am not sure those of us in the policymaking realm “get it”—at least not yet. Just as globalization has created new dashboards for business operators, it has rewired the lights and switches on policymakers’ control panels. My guess is that the relationship between these lights and switches and the real world of production, prices and jobs is not what it was two decades ago—or a decade ago or even two years ago. It is important that policymakers begin to better understand what is actually going on. Traditional theories and economic models that do not adequately incorporate globalization are likely to result in policy responses that might be too strong or too weak, too soon or too late.\n\nIn the world of central banking, as I said earlier, we are keenly interested in how globalization affects our ability to deliver on our mandate for economic growth with stable prices. We know, of course, that more open economies bring added competition—much of it from places like China and India—that can produce in great volume at lower cost. So we see, for example, that the prices of clothing, electronics, white goods, toys and other heavily traded goods have been held in check. That is the obvious part of globalization—the impact on the availability and prices of traded goods. That is a no-brainer.\n\nLess visible, but no less important, is the incentive foreign competition gives U.S. producers to increase efficiency and remain competitive. We at the Fed talk regularly with hundreds of CEOs, COOs and CFOs, from companies big and small, throughout this vast nation. Almost all of them dwell on the growing internationalization of their businesses and the need for driving productivity up and holding costs down. Under relentless pressure from both consumers and shareholders, they profit by finding the most attractive inputs and processes available anyplace on earth and anywhere within cyberspace.\n\nOne obvious assist to business has come from the fact that globalization has enormously increased labor supply. The math here is pretty simple. In the early ’90s, the disintegration of the stranglehold of the Soviet Union released millions of hungry workers into the system, from little Estonia to bigger countries like Poland. China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century, and over 700 million workers came into play. And now India, with its hundreds of millions of working-age people, has joined the game.\n\nThe U.S. economy has benefited from this surge of new workers. While China gains as an important source of the world’s manufacturing output, its gains have come at the expense of former powerhouses like France and Italy and Japan and other more rigid, less competitive countries. We, on the other hand, have been better able to innovate and adapt and compete. Fear-mongering to the contrary, the United States is not losing ground to this growing Asian giant, despite the long-term shrinking of our manufacturing sector relative to our services sector. It may surprise you to know that, despite the fact that the U.S. remains the world’s largest manufacturer, only 10.5 percent of U.S. jobs are in the manufacturing sector (and only 1.5 percent are in agriculture). We have prospered, and we have driven unemployment down to the lowest level in over four years, by moving up the value-added ladder and becoming the world’s dominant power in creating innovative services.\n\nIncreasing competition in the labor market, I should note, does not come just from vast labor pools making goods and equipment in factories located abroad. It also comes from immigrants, who have contributed more than half of U.S. labor force growth in the past decade. The spread of Information Age technology and the removal of the isolationist yoke of communism and statist regimes create opportunities for virtual immigration as well. In a world wired with fiber-optic cables, foreign workers deliver services from far off—a software program written in Estonia, a call-processing center in Bangalore, or back-office work sent to the Caribbean.\n\nIt would thus appear that one clear consequence of the spread of globalization, the global workforce’s increasing integration into the U.S. economy, has dulled wage pressures here, exerting downward pressure on inflation.\n\nWhat about the impact of imported goods? Analysts who focus only on traditional measures of trade deny globalization’s impact on inflation, noting that imported goods make up a mere 10 percent of U.S. consumption. In nations more integrated with the rest of the world, the import share may rise to 20 percent or 25 percent. The tail never wags the dog, so other countries’ impact on our inflation has to be remote—or so the theory goes.\n\nI beg to differ.\n\nTo be sure, anybody who wanders down the aisle of a Wal-Mart or a Costco or Target store knows that whatever the portion of imported tradable goods, prices of clothing and electronics and almost everything else that you can feel, smell, watch or listen to have become more affordable because of globalization. But the impact is more invasive than that. The distinction between tradables and nontradables is not fixed and absolute. Over time, more and more items become tradable as technological barriers fall and transport costs shrink.\n\nAlan Blinder, a thoughtful economist with a much bigger brain than mine, points out that we can no longer follow the traditional dichotomy between tradables as things that can be put in a container and shipped and nontradables as things that cannot be packed up and sent. “In the future, and to a great extent already in the present,” Blinder writes, “the key distinction for international trade will no longer be between things that can be put in a box and things that cannot. It will, instead, be between services that can be delivered electronically over long distances with little or no degradation of quality, and those that cannot.”\n\nProfessor Blinder teaches economics at Princeton, which shows he has a healthy sense of humor. But he is also a former Fed vice chairman, which tells you he is a serious player. He is well aware that the preponderance of our economic activity and household income derives from services.\n\nEven when you think in terms of labor rather than products, you see a blurring of the concept of what is “tradable.” Real estate, the leisure and hospitality industries, and medical services are generally considered purely domestic, immune from the vagaries of global competition. It is not difficult, however, to detect important global influences in all of them. Who does much of the construction work? Who cleans the rooms and cooks the meals at many of our hotels and resorts? How many doctors and nurses have come to this country from overseas?\n\nThe supplies, and therefore the prices, of many so-called nontradable goods and services are clearly impacted by globalization—at least by my notion of globalization, which includes the cross-border movement of labor and capital as well as goods. You don’t have to live on the border with Mexico to grasp that notion. Just go to a construction site in Chicago or Miami or Seattle and watch and listen. As the great economist Yogi Berra once said, “You can observe a lot just by watching.”\n\nWithout added labor from overseas in all of its forms, U.S. wages would be rising faster. Many might welcome that. After all, Americans would be receiving fatter paychecks. But we would also be facing higher inflation, with all its unpleasant consequences. Without the contribution of the global workforce, moreover, the quantity and variety of goods and services available in the United States would diminish.\n\nI have argued, within the temple of the Fed and without, that globalization has in these and many other ways expanded our concept of “capacity constraints” and redefined our sense of “resource utilization.” It has helped tame inflation. That has been the trend of recent years. But it has not exorcised for once and for all time the demon of inflation.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund recently released its World Economic Outlook, which includes a chapter on globalization and inflation. The report issues a warning that I think bears repeating. “Globalization,” the IMF concludes, “has undoubtedly provided some brake on inflation in the industrial economies in recent years and has allowed for a more measured monetary policy [meaning we have been able to keep interest rates low]…. However, globalization cannot be relied upon to keep a lid on inflationary pressures…. Strong global growth and diminishing [global] economic slack have reduced the restraining impact of declining import prices on inflation.”\n\nEven if you argue, as I do, that globalization’s effect is not limited simply to prices of imported goods and services, one can envision a scenario in which increased resource utilization in other countries might add to inflation rather than mitigate it. We might well be seeing evidence of this as growing demand in emerging economies drives up the prices of oil, copper, zinc and other commodities, even after netting out the speculative excess that has been impacting those markets.\n\nMy point is that even though the playing field has been enlarged and reconfigured by globalization, and even though the world is a far more exciting place, moving at the pace and with the suspense of a modern thriller, there still are some time-tested risks that Federal Reserve officials and other central bankers must fear and manage. We are cursed with still having to “read the stuffing out of” the classic texts, even as some of us seek to improve upon them and adapt them to modern society. The advent of China and India, the introduction of the Internet, new frontiers of science like the Human Genome Project and yes, even the BlackBerry and the iPod and other drivers of greater efficiency, productivity, interconnectivity and economic homogenization, do not overturn the basic premise, for example, that too much money chasing too few goods or productive investments leads to inflation—regardless of whether the sources or placement of those monies are in new places and in new technologies.\n\nThat said, globalization is not going to go away, even if politicians given to the expediency of protectionism or building walls or other costly follies draw up laws that attempt to slow it down. Globalization is here to stay.\n\nGlobalization is not a one-off event; its effects are dynamic and profound. An analogy is the deregulation of U.S. banks and airlines in the late 1970s, both supposedly one-off events. Who would argue that these companies aren’t still adjusting to these one-time shocks? When I helped negotiate China into the World Trade Organization, a process that was not completed until the start of the Bush 43 administration, I knew my yet-to-be-born grandchildren would be dealing with the tail end of the changes wrought by China’s entry into the global marketplace.\n\nI think it is pretty clear that with the emergence of China—and, following in its wake, India, Vietnam and practically everyone else—countries will face heightened competition for valuable factors of production, especially for capital to finance them. Many of these nations, including our own, will have to adjust their fiscal, monetary, legal and regulatory policies if they are to attract capital. We discuss this in the Dallas Fed’s 2005 annual report, which, by the way, reads more like Agatha Christie than Shakespeare, despite its being rooted in fact, not fiction. You might want to go to our web site. Our study finds that the most successful countries in a globalized world place the least burden on the free flow of capital, ideas, people, goods and services.\n\nEven politicians, regardless of party or country, who are genetically wired to thrive on spending O.P.M.—other people’s money—are getting the message. The Financial Times recently reported that Peer Steinbrück, Germany’s finance minister, “pledged to fight back against low taxation in competing European countries, promising a tax system that improved German companies’ global competitiveness.” By way of explanation, Steinbrück said, “An effective tax rate of 39 percent is not internationally competitive.” His words contrast sharply with those of his predecessor, who argued that the Poles, Estonians and other new Europeans should raise their taxes if they want to play nice. Taxes impact costs, and costs impact inflation. Who knows what chain of events a reduction or restructuring in German taxes would set off in Europe and around the world?\n\nThis is what keeps the economists at the Fed on their toes. Economists like to model things. They take the real world, distilling it into equations and graphs to measure how this affects that. The models have enhanced our understanding of the choices consumers, workers, companies, investors and governments make every day. Without them, central bankers would be handicapped in making informed decisions.\n\nEconomic models dealing with global influences have been around for hundreds of years. Modeling evolves along with the economy. The problem is that few models deal with today’s rapidly changing manifestation of globalization. Tremendous complexity is required to capture the sophisticated working and resulting impacts of the changes we are experiencing.\n\nSo far, the models I have seen in the academic literature look at globalization the way a mechanic might look at a vintage Mustang and time how long it takes for it to go from zero to 60 both before and after replacing the rear axle. The problem is, our globalizing economy is not a vintage car. It is more like a 2006 BMW Z4 roadster, fully equipped and Bluetooth enabled. It is a very complex, highly integrated, technologically advanced and brilliantly engineered vehicle that just cannot help exceeding the posted speed limit. Models telling us that changes in the classic Mustang’s rear axle will barely impact its performance are of little use to anyone trying to estimate the top speeds at which a new BMW can handle curves safely. We need to continue devising and refining economic models for a new generation, so we can negotiate the curves on the superhighway that is the modern economy. This is what the research team at the Dallas Fed has been called on to do.\n\nMany of the new realities of globalization are obvious. Unless you have been on another planet, you all know the forces of globalization, now unleashed, continue to remake our world. The challenge lies in understanding what’s going on around us and then harnessing that knowledge so that the U.S. can continue to prosper in a rapidly changing, hypercompetitive world economy. As members of the Dallas Assembly, you have to constantly do this in your businesses, in your law firms and in the many ways you serve this great community. At the Federal Reserve, we must do the same. We will keep you posted on what we learn. And we ask you to return the favor.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "May 20, 2006 University of Texas at Austin\n\nI must sound like an odd duck: a midshipman who became an academic who morphed into a hedge fund manager who became an ambassador and trade negotiator who became a central banker. It all sounds a little serendipitous, if not a little nuts. My daughter Alison once summed me up as the career equivalent of Virginia Woolf’s book To the Lighthouse because, as she put it, “Dad, you have no plot and you never end.”\n\nWell, we are here at the end of an important phase of your lives, the granting of your respective degrees in economics. I hope your interest in this field never really ends. And I hope that having come this far, you understand by this time that yes, indeed there is a plot to economics.\n\nWhen you announced your intended major to your parents, I’m betting they breathed a sigh of relief that you were not choosing medieval French poets as your major. There is much to learn from the medieval period—perhaps more than we can learn from France today. And poetry is, indeed, a refined medium, alone or transformed to song. But few would quarrel with the proposition that there are more job opportunities available today for econ majors. Now that’s a good plot line! Your course of study at this great university has tangible value. “Yes!” say Mom and Dad.\n\nThe meaning of the degree you are going to receive today is, however, far greater than what you might receive for your first paycheck as a consultant or analyst or investment banker or teacher or—if you have the same success I had as a newly minted graduate with an economics degree from Harvard—as a bartender.\n\nEconomics has a unique attribute: It is a liberating course of study. It frees you from ignorance. It gives you powerful tools for reasoning. It provides a logical, consistent and faithful framework that you can apply again and again to think rationally about the world. A good economist is to society what Vince Young is to the game of football—you possess the ability to look down the field, read it and bring order to what anybody else might consider chaos and confusion. Properly applied, it allows you—and the people you instruct in a classroom or lead in the workplace—to score victories against mighty opponents.\n\nWe live in a world undergoing dramatic change. Capitalism and the pursuit of profit—once contested by armed and dangerous opponents in the form of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China, rejected by then-mortal enemies in Vietnam and ignored by great, but highly bureaucratized states like India—is now embraced by all but a few rogue Latin American and African states. When I was in college, we sent young men to die in a “hot war” in Indochina to protect Asia from communism. We fought a cold war in which we faced mutually assured nuclear destruction from our competitors. Today, we compete for prosperity through markets.\n\nSo different is your world from that I ventured into with my undergraduate degree in economics that today, the debt of Vietnam trades at a yield premium to that of Ford Motor Co. When I graduated from college in 1971, we were still killing the Vietnamese. Much of the Vietnam War had been led by a Secretary of Defense who was the former CEO of Ford. Today, the proceeds of shorting Ford’s stock are invested in the Vietnamese market. And as to our other former Asian protagonist, there isn’t an American business woman or man alive who doesn’t covet access to the wellspring of China.\n\nTalk about taming the animal spirits!\n\nThere is healing power in the weaponry of economics. This is what we know from studying the seminal works of great economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo and John Maynard Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter and... Langston Hughes and Robert Earl Keen.\n\nAdam Smith, of course, taught us to trust the miracle of the “invisible hand.” If there is one thing we know as Americans, it is that incentivized properly by government and unhindered by the darker impulses of politicians, the men and women who run the private sector—the millions of middle managers and decisionmakers who empower the machine that produces $13 trillion of American output a year and figure out how to grow our economy at rates and for time intervals no one thought possible—act as the nerve endings in the fingers of that invisible hand, reaching into every corner of the globe to extract value, drive productivity and secure our economic future in a globalized world.\n\nDavid Ricardo? Well, he taught us the principle of comparative advantage. We produce most effectively what we produce most competitively. And in doing so, we elevate the standard of living of all our people.\n\nThe legendary British Prime Minister Winston Churchill understood this better than most great leaders. He was a free trader. He spoke of the “superfine processes.” He understood that the cure of protectionism was worse than the disease of competition. Let those who can produce goods cheapest, even with subsidies from their governments, sell those goods unfettered into the British market, he argued. The Brits would take those cheap inputs, add value and turn those inputs into “superfine” products that would command greater prices, generate greater profits and, with those profits, finance greater job creation—just as we do today with imports of goods from China and services from India. We take them in, add to them and move up the value-added ladder to grow our economy by some $410 billion in incremental growth a year—an incremental growth equal to the entire output of Malaysia, Ireland, Chile and Kenya all added together. This is the process that propels California to produce more than China; the process that empowers the 23 million people of Texas to produce 28 percent more output than the 1.1 billion of India; the process that now employs 135 million Americans, having driven the unemployment rate to its lowest level in years.\n\nAnd John Maynard Keynes? Keynes did far more than simply show us what a Republican Congress has learned to practice even better than Democrats: that government spending and deficit accumulation can goose the economy beyond sustainable means. He gave us one of history’s greatest little ditties.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the Bretton Woods conferences were convened to draw up the institutional architecture for rebuilding Europe and making the world safe for capitalism with a World Bank, an International Monetary Fund and a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (which has since evolved into the World Trade Organization). We were the victors in the Second World War, and just as to the victors go the spoils, to the great economists of the United States went control of Bretton Woods. Keynes—who possessed the most fertile mind of the people there assembled but was not an American—complained bitterly to Lord Halifax, the British ambassador at the time, of the Americans’ arrogance, and Halifax sought to comfort him:\n\nWell, it turns out we had both money and brains! For we mastered what Joseph Schumpeter professed from his classrooms at my alma mater after the war: the process of “creative destruction.”\n\nLet me cite three passages from Schumpeter’s great works. Listen carefully, economists.\n\nFirst, he said: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.”\n\nThen: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory…illustrate the same process of industrial mutation…that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is…what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nAnd then, to hammer home his point, Schumpeter wrote: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nString the key operative phrases of those three citations of Schumpeter's together and you get the plot of the story, the plot of the modern, globalized economy we now live in: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic. . . revolutionizes the economic structure, . . . destroying the old one, . . . creating a new one. . . . [It] upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions, . . . and hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nThe master of the creative destruction of syntax, Yogi Berra, put it more eloquently: Once you open new markets, “History just ain’t what it used to be.”\n\nToday, China and India, nanotechnology, the Internet and the human genome project, the BlackBerry and the iPod are the railroads of the 21st century that are changing the landscape of history. They are propelling us forward into a world in which whatever was optimal before is no longer so. From now on, history just isn’t what it used to be.\n\nAnd, with all this change swirling around us, you—you who have grounding in economics—have within your tool kit the means to define the newly optimal path to prosperity, to guide us forward in a hypercompetitive, seemingly discombobulated world.\n\nConsider yourselves the trustees of the potential of America. By mastering, by proselytizing and by improving upon the basic teachings of economics—the principles of competition, profit and utility maximization, comparative advantage, creative destruction, survivor theory, rational expectations, time inconsistency, game theory, Ricardian equivalence, public choice theory, growth theory and monetarism—you have in your hands a compass for navigating the treacherous waters of a tumultuous world. It works for me. Just as I am guided in my work today by the essential economics lesson I learned as an undergraduate economics major that too much money chasing too few goods gives rise to inflation, economic “true north” is now within you—your faithful friend and guide through life.\n\nWhat about Hughes and Keen? Where do they fit in? Both are distinctly not medieval or French, and neither is an economist. Yet Langston Hughes reminds us through his eloquent poetry of what motivates all of mankind—American, Chinese, English, Indian, Christian and Jew and Muslim:\n\nAnd:\n\nThe fundamental desire to have access and to have the opportunity to succeed drives all of non-Gaullist woman- and mankind. You can’t run from it. You can’t hide from it. But you, my learned friends, can channel it. This is what economists do! They provide the theoretical and the practical roadmaps for realizing humankind’s dreams.\n\nThat is what I preach today from this pulpit. The disciplines of economics can set you free! Diploma in hand, you are charged with becoming the evangelists of a powerful gospel learned right here, in the Economics Department of the University of Texas. Go out into the world and transform it.\n\nBut let’s get back to the moment. Today, 245 of you are about to receive your bachelor’s degree in economics, one of you will receive your master’s degree, and eight of you have earned the highest of academic accomplishment, your doctorate of philosophy.\n\nHere is where Robert Earl Keen comes into play.\n\nI know he is an Aggie. But he makes good music and is quintessentially Texan. He was spot on when he sang:\n\nLook around you. Those who love you are beaming. Your moms and your dads and your sisters and brothers and lovers and friends and classmates and your professors are the ones who got you here. They sustained you and stood by you. They paid your tuition. They taught you. They comforted you when you were blue. They drank with you when you were down, and they drank with you when you were up. (En vino, or at least, margaritas, veritas!) They pushed you and cajoled you and motivated you to cross the finish line.\n\nThey deserve a little gratitude.\n\nI want you to stand up, turn around and look at this audience of supporters and say:“Thanks. I love you. You are all that matters in the end.”\n\nAnd I want you to hug ’em. Kiss ’em after you get your diploma.\n\nJust do it.\n\nCongratulations, graduates!\n\nAnd, oh, one last pearl of wisdom: “Hook ’em horns.”"

        "content": "April 19, 2006 Buenos Aires\n\nMany of my fellow Federal Reserve Bank presidents are economists by training and trade. I am not. My academic career culminated in an M.B.A. from Stanford, received after undergraduate studies in economics at Harvard and a “vacation” reading Latin American Studies at Oxford.\n\nFor many years, I made my living as an investor, running a hedge-fund and portfolio-management business that specialized in globally diversified equities and distressed debt. After beating the house for 20 years, I figured I was pressing my luck, and I cashed in, walked away from the game and became a U.S. trade negotiator. As a deputy trade representative, I spent a great deal of time negotiating bilateral issues with Argentina’s government. With substantial input from Martin Redrado, I worked with Argentina on plans for the proposed Área de Libre Comercio de las Américas—the ALCA or, in English, the Free Trade Area of the Americas—an effort that, despite our collective best efforts, never got off the ground.\n\nNow, both Martin and I play different roles—we are central bankers. I am delighted to be with him again. I consider him a friend whose company and intellectual insights I value. I thank you, Martin, for inviting me to speak to this distinguished forum today.\n\nI am told that many of you work in the financial industry, as I did many years ago. I feel comfortable sharing my views with people who are out there in the trenches, experiencing every day globalization’s impact on their business opportunities and the gearing of their economies.\n\nI come by my interest in globalization honestly. My father was Australian, my mother a Norwegian born and raised in South Africa. They met in East London (South Africa) and tried to get into the United States in 1939, only to be denied entry. So they had to settle instead in Tijuana, right across the U.S. border in Mexico, and they lived there until they became U.S. citizens in 1947. Almost immediately, my father took a job with a chemical company, which sent him to Shanghai to close down operations as the communist forces were decimating the Nationalist army. My parents returned to the United States shortly before I was born in Los Angeles. Not long afterward, we moved to Mexico City, where I attended primary school and learned the less-than-perfect Spanish I am taking the liberty of inflicting upon you today.\n\nHere is the point of all that personal history: I was “manufactured” in China of components that came from Australia and Norway via South Africa. I was “assembled” in Mexico, and I realized my “value-added” in the United States.\n\nI am a true son of globalization.\n\nLet me remind you of another son of globalization: Sir Edmund James Palmer Norton. Sir Edmund was born on the frontier between Denmark and Germany to English parents. After earning an engineering degree in the U.K., he landed a job building a railroad across the Andes from Argentina to Chile. In the process, he visited Mendoza, where he realized the region’s potential for wine production. In 1895, he founded a winery in Perdriel, later importing vines from France.\n\nAnd so, Argentina’s wine industry was born. Norton established one of the country’s great legacies. Thanks to that industry, a whole region of the country has prospered, belying the claims of those who say globalization impoverishes people and reduces living standards. The wine industry provides thousands of jobs for workers with all levels of education and skills—from the croppers who pick the grapes by hand, to the agricultural engineers who monitor the soils, to the oenologists who supervise the winemaking process. In addition, there is the indirect economic activity from wine country tourism, as well as business in financing vineyard operations and distributing wine here and overseas.\n\nToday, Argentine wines are highly competitive in the global marketplace. Wine lovers the world over have benefited from the availability of Argentine cabernets and merlots on the shelves beside French, Italian, Chilean and California brands. We U.S. consumers are seeing more and more Argentine wines in our stores, and we do enjoy them. And I should add—in vino veritas!—that I personally enjoy them very much. I will refrain from any meddlesome comments about Argentina’s trade policies as they affect agricultural exports, with one exception: As a connoisseur of wines—please, never ban Malbec exports!\n\nNew Ways of Thinking\nLet me get serious now. What do I mean by globalization? There are many convoluted definitions of the term. Mine is simple: In the world we now live in, economic potential is no longer defined or confined by political or geographic boundaries. A globalized world is one where goods, services, money, workers and ideas migrate to wherever they can work together most efficiently, flexibly, securely and profitably.\n\nBecause of my far-ranging origins, I have been drawn to the idea of globalization as a birthright. My experience at the Fed has, if anything, increased my interest in it. I am convinced that central bankers everywhere need to better understand the forces behind globalization as they pursue monetary policies that lay the foundation for sustainable, non-inflationary growth in employment and output. This afternoon, I want to expand on this. I will do so in my personal capacity and, as always, speak today for neither my colleagues at the Federal Reserve nor the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMost of you probably remember the Tequila Crisis. In early 1995, shock waves from a financial earthquake in another hemisphere traveled silently through the Panama Canal and across the Amazon, then exploded over the Pampas. And it all occurred because of the collapse of the market for short-term Mexican government debt, the infamous tesobonos. A small lapse thousands of miles away was enough to trigger a panic that almost brought to its knees the dollar-standard regime that had put an end to decades of chronic high inflation in Argentina.\n\nGiven this background, as well as other cases of relatively small economies being buffeted by external developments, it is only natural for central bankers here and elsewhere to approach their monetary policy decisions with an eye on developments elsewhere in the world. Domestic monetary policies can sometimes be less important than the effects of the policies adopted by the United States, Europe, Japan and other large economies.\n\nMaybe that is why Latin American central bankers seem in some ways ahead of the rest of the world in realizing globalization’s impact on monetary policy. Most of you already know we can no longer assume economic or financial developments in remote parts of the world—new technologies or suppliers in some cases, financial market disruptions in others—will leave our economies unscathed.\n\nThis is second nature to you. So you may find it surprising that in preparing for my job at the Dallas Fed, I discovered that U.S. central bankers have not always had the same level of awareness about globalization’s importance for monetary policy.\n\nOne of the books I read during my self-imparted training for this job was A Term at the Fed, an excellent, first-hand account by former Fed Governor Larry Meyer. The book gives a good sense of the lexicon of monetary policy deliberations. The language of Fedspeak is full of sacrosanct terms—such as “output gap” and “capacity constraints” and “the natural rate of unemployment,” known by its successor acronym, NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\n\nAll this jargon reflects the fact that central bankers do not wish to strain the economy’s capacity to produce. They want GDP to run at no more than its theoretical speed limit because going too fast for too long might stoke the fires of inflation. One key factor influencing the economy’s capacity, for example, is the size of the labor pool. The shibboleth known as the Phillips curve posits that increasing employment beyond a certain level will ignite demands for greater pay, with eventual inflationary consequences for the entire economy.\n\nThe econometric calculations behind the Phillips curve, capacity constraints and output gaps were based on assumptions of a world that, in my opinion, no longer exists. It is my understanding that conventional economic concepts are also being challenged in these latitudes. Here in Argentina, the jargon is different. It is replete with such terms as “currency substitution,” “fear of floating,” “sudden stops” and “flight to quality.” They conjure up images of a policymaking process conducted amidst the tectonic forces of globalization.\n\nI am almost certain that was the intention of the superb Latin American theorists who pioneered the use of these terms, among them the great Argentine economist Guillermo Calvo. True, I sometimes find references to the Phillips curve in Latin America’s monetary policy discussions, but not with the frequency and emphasis I encounter in the United States.\n\nPerhaps economic adversity explains why Phillips curves, output gaps and other such concepts do not enjoy the same popularity in this region as they do in the U.S. Latin America’s inflation was rampant in the 1980s. During that so-called “lost decade,” many countries experienced chronic but seemingly benign annual inflation rates of 15 percent—if you can call a doubling of the price level in five years benign. Then, almost overnight, inflations turned into hyperinflations. My conjecture is that the dramatic social consequences of those episodes gave policymakers and economists much stronger incentives to understand why their economies did not realize the employment gains the Phillips curve suggests should come with higher inflation.\n\nIn the search for answers, Latin American central bankers may have been persuaded early on by the powerful arguments Robert Lucas offered in a 1972 paper that would earn him the Nobel Prize a little over two decades later. According to Lucas, central bankers could not exploit the Phillips curve’s inflation–output trade-off simply because such a relationship was intrinsically nonexploitable. The negative correlation between the inflation and unemployment rates captured in the Phillips curve is a mirage. It is there, you can see it in the data, but you cannot “touch it,” so to speak. Attempts to “touch it” will result in stinging frustration: A higher inflation will produce just that, a higher inflation, without any effects on economic activity or employment.\n\nPerhaps globalization had a role in pushing Latin American central bankers to accept Lucas’ critique. Every time they had tried to take advantage of the Phillips curve, pushing inflation a little higher to pump up output, the resulting capital outflows sent their economies into recession, reduced tax revenues and forced them to pay the bills by printing money. Making monetary policy decisions with the elusive Phillips curve in mind had led to pushing the wrong buttons. Once Latin America’s central bankers ceased to trust the Phillips curve, inflation rates plummeted. Argentina, for example, could point with pride to one of the world’s lowest inflation rates by the 1990s.\n\nEven in the latter part of the ’90s, the lessons Latin America’s central bankers had learned the hard way had not penetrated the United States. As a result, we almost ended up pushing the wrong buttons. Since this audience may be unfamiliar with U.S. policy debates of the 1990s, let me give you a brief account of what went on.\n\nIn the second half of the decade, U.S. economic growth was strong and accelerating. Unemployment was low, approaching rates unseen since the 1960s. In these circumstances, inflation was supposed to rise—if you believed in the Phillips curve and prevailing views of output gaps, capacity constraints and the NAIRU. That is what the Fed staff’s models were saying. In his book, Governor Meyer tells how he and nearly all the other Fed governors and presidents around the FOMC table concluded that monetary policy should be tightened to head off the inevitable price increases. They were frustrated by Chairman Greenspan’s insistence on postponing rate hikes, yet perplexed that inflation wasn’t rising. Indeed, it kept falling.\n\nIf the conventional wisdom had prevailed, the Fed would have pushed the wrong buttons and slowed the economy. According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations by economists I respect, real GDP would have been lower by several hundred billion dollars. Employment gains would have been reduced by perhaps a million jobs. The costs of not being right on the critical calibrations of monetary policy would have been huge.\n\nHow was Greenspan able to get it right when other very smart men and women did not? Well, we now see with 20/20 hindsight what Greenspan instinctively saw early on—that accelerating productivity had begun to alter the traditional relationships among economic variables. Greenspan is a great listener and very perceptive. He had been hearing from business leaders that the revolution in information technology had allowed their companies to reap rapid gains in output and cut costs. He understood what that meant for the economy as a whole.\n\nIn the realm of macroeconomic theory, ideas that supported Greenspan’s policy stance were already taking shape. A leader in these intellectual developments was one of the great minds of the economics profession, who, I can claim with pride, has been a Dallas Fed consultant for more than a decade. I’m talking about 2004 Nobel laureate Finn Kydland. He and co-winner and co-author Edward Prescott, an economist affiliated with the Minneapolis Fed, had determined as early as 1982 that supply-side shocks like those hitting the United States in the 1990s were the most important factor in post–World War II business cycles.\n\nAccording to Kydland and Prescott, productivity gains, a frequent source of supply-side shocks, had accounted for as much as two-thirds of the U.S. economy’s fluctuation after 1945. They concluded that, at least for the United States in recent decades, fluctuations in the price level have been countercyclical. Put differently, changes in the price level tend to be below trend when economic activity is above trend. In 1997, by the way, Kydland and our own Dallas Fed economist Carlos Zarazaga found that the price level in Argentina exhibits the same countercyclical pattern Kydland and Prescott uncovered for the United States.\n\nLooking at the graphs and equations of the Kydland and Prescott model is not exactly like contemplating Velázquez’s Las Meninas, but it nonetheless has the same revolutionary significance. Kydland and Prescott rocked the profession. When it comes to monetary policy, their findings had far-reaching implications. Their work led to policy prescriptions that ran contrary to the prevailing wisdom: In the presence of a productivity surge, the Fed should not tighten but should instead let the economy enjoy the ride without fearing a rise in inflationary pressures. That is the exact opposite of the recommendation suggested by the traditional views described in Meyer’s book. But it is right in line with the conclusions Greenspan arrived at in a more intuitive fashion.\n\nBefore moving on, I want to review the timeline. Kydland and Prescott’s initial path-breaking paper, titled “Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations,” was published in 1982. More than a decade later, Meyer tells us, U.S. policymakers’ primary frame of reference was still the same Phillips-curve, output-gap paradigm that Kydland and Prescott had shown inadequate for high-productivity-growth periods like the late 1990s.\n\nWhy such a mismatch between theoretical insights and central bank practices? I cannot answer that question with any authority, but I want to make an observation. There seems to be a long lag between the time a new paradigm emerges and when policymakers effectively use it to guide their decisions. This only increases my sense of urgency about the need to deepen our understanding of globalization’s impact on monetary policy. Countries around the world, including this one, are feeling the effects of the productivity surge occurring in China and India—a direct consequence, by the way, of the market-friendly reforms those countries are implementing in a deliberate effort to become full members of the globalization club. We need to comprehend how the world works because knowledge gives us a better chance of pushing the right buttons.\n\nThinking about Globalization\nThe experiences of Latin America, Chairman Greenspan’s intuitive wisdom and the empirical work of Kydland and Prescott all point toward the same conclusion: The old economic tool kit can no longer do the job. We need new tools—a rejiggering, if you will—of our econometric equations for a globalizing economy.\n\nThe forces of globalization can produce productivity shocks, rippling through economies in ways similar to the U.S. technology-driven shocks of the 1990s. Productivity increases abroad reduce the cost of consumer goods and imported inputs at home, helping hold down domestic inflation.\n\nI do not see how flexible exchange rates can sever the connection between foreign productivity shocks and the domestic cost of living, although that is what traditional economic theory teaches. If domestic prices are “sticky” for any reason, the economy may react to developments abroad in different ways under flexible and fixed exchange rates. But merely acknowledging a “reaction” suggests policymakers need to know how to recognize the impacts and adjust for them. Productivity improvements in China, for example, might prompt a different reaction from the monetary authority, depending on whether Chinese products represent 1 percent, 10 percent or 50 percent of the consumers’ market basket.\n\nAt this point, the debate becomes quantitative: What we central bankers must do to maintain price stability may depend on parameters that determine how local goods substitute for imports or on the nontradable proportion of the typical consumer’s basket. Perhaps those who question globalization’s importance are suggesting that the current values of such globalization parameters are too small to play an important role in setting monetary policy. According to that view, for all practical purposes, U.S. monetary policy should be set as if the rest of the world didn’t exist.\n\nWe all know, for example, that nontradable goods account for a sizable fraction of U.S. consumer price indexes. Take housing, which can represent a quarter to two-fifths of a typical household’s budget. Because houses and the land they sit on are nontradable, a decline in Chinese housing costs has no impact whatsoever on U.S. price indexes.\n\nI do not find this argument compelling. To me, tradable goods are not limited to what can be boxed up and put on a container ship or sent abroad over the Internet. I would expand the definition to any good whose price is subject to arbitrage. I do not think it is farfetched to argue that if Paris housing prices get too high, people will relocate to other cities, like Rome or Madrid. Or even beautiful Buenos Aires. Of course, we need to discuss parameter values, such as the desirability of Buenos Aires relative to Paris at various housing price differentials. But the point remains: It is hard to think of goods that are completely nontradable under the arbitrage criteria.\n\nEven productivity gains in foreign nontradables can have an impact on monetary policy at home. Let me suggest a plausible transmission channel. A recent study by Emek Basker of the University of Missouri estimates that prices for a wide range of goods—toothpaste, shampoo, aspirin, laundry detergent and the like—fall 7 to 13 percent five years after Wal-Mart arrives in a city. So assume a Wal-Martization of China, which would confer on Chinese consumers the benefits of supposedly nontradable retail services. As a result of Wal-Mart’s lower prices, however, real wages in China would go up, and with them demand for U.S. products. This is a scenario that might call for monetary policy response, depending again on the yet unknown values of certain globalization parameters.\n\nHow important is this aspect of the “Wal-Mart effect”? Perhaps small, perhaps large. We do not know—and that is the problem. In the spirit of exposing the sin but not the sinner, let me remind you that in the 1990s, well-respected economists published papers in top professional journals arguing that productivity shocks were not important during that decade. Now, those same scholars are busy cranking out papers to tell us that … well ... productivity did matter after all.\n\nI learned from Greenspan that it is important to follow one’s instincts, guided in my case by my own experience and almost daily personal contact with market participants (and comforted by the knowledge that I am surrounded by level-headed, thoughtful colleagues at the Federal Reserve). I guess that is in the nature of things. Each of us has the responsibility to report the enemy’s position as we see it from our vantage point on the battlefield. Scholars may need to be skeptical of the claim that globalization is becoming more important for monetary policy. From my position as a central banker, using insights gathered before I arrived at the post, I have a responsibility to communicate the opposite. My business contacts talk and act as if the globalization now under way will bring another decade of intense competition. This hothouse will enable—perhaps even force—businesses to keep productivity growth in the range we have enjoyed since the mid-1990s—hopefully, for many years to come. If labor productivity growth can stay near 3 percent, monetary policy can accommodate relatively faster growth without igniting inflation.\n\nI understand the formidable theoretical and empirical challenges of establishing a connection between globalization, productivity and inflation. It could take us a long time to establish such relationships with some confidence, although I pray it will not take as long as the 300 years it took to prove Fermat’s last mathematical theorem! I am hopeful that in reasonable time, the brilliant economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and others in the economics profession—men and women who are true economists and not just M.B.A.’s like me—will provide us with useful guidelines for how globalization impacts policy decisions.\n\nIn closing, let me remind everybody here that regardless of your views on globalization, keeping inflation in check is a central bank’s sacred mission. By spurring productivity and fomenting tectonic economic change, globalization has thus far acted as a tailwind for the Fed’s—and other central banks’—efforts to hold down inflation. I believe the Fed has been able to contain inflation with faster growth than would have been possible in the absence of globalization. The secular impact of enormous new capacity and factor inputs from China, India and the other new economic entrants—transmitted through globalization—has offset the price pressures on commodities and other goods that have been spurred by growing demand in those countries, as well as normal cyclical price developments.\n\nWill the tailwinds stay with us?\n\nLeft to their own devices, I think they would remain for a significant time. But the political dimension cannot be discounted. I have been and will remain outspoken about the dangers of protectionism in the United States. Protectionism is nothing but a tax on the consumer and the businesses that use foreign inputs. Every protectionist impulse, however politically advantageous for a particular political jurisdiction or an individual industry, undercuts globalization’s favorable impact on inflation. Protectionism could lead to interest rates higher than otherwise required to maintain low inflation.\n\nHaving voiced my antipathy for protectionism and interference with the positive impact of globalization on the price mechanism through political expediency, I should point out to this distinguished audience that the Congress and the executive branch of the United States have respected the Federal Reserve’s independence. All of us, on the central bank side of the equation and the political side, have vivid memories of the dangers of diverting monetary policy from its goal of conducting itself so as to achieve sustainable non-inflationary growth in employment and output—even under conditions of extreme political crisis.\n\nAs a Texan, I am mindful of the story about William McChesney Martin, Fed chairman from 1951 to 1970. President Lyndon B. Johnson invited him down to his Texas ranch for what turned out to be a one-on-one meeting. The president wanted a more accommodating monetary policy, and Martin, a strong advocate of Fed independence, tried to explain to him the consequences of that course of action. Johnson would have none of it and advanced on Martin, shoving him around the room and shouting, “Boys dying in Vietnam, and Bill Martin doesn’t care!” Years later, Martin, who had until that moment been an exemplary central banker, expressed his regrets about shifting policy to suit the president. “To my everlasting shame,” he said, “I finally gave in to him.”\n\nPresidents Clinton and Bush have allowed the Fed to operate with a high degree of independence. On the whole, the U.S. Congress has also wisely refrained from interference. Without its independence from political interference, I doubt the Fed could have so successfully set the interest rates that have led to today’s strong U.S. economy. Just as I doubt that, without independence from the rigid econometric dicta of well-intentioned but outdated experts, monetary policy could have so adroitly harnessed, and in turn lubricated, the forces of globalization.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "April 11, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nThe thought of speaking to such an august assembly in April was difficult enough. Then you invited me to address the Friday Group on … a Tuesday. You know, this could get downright confusing. I am happy to see so many of you managed to show up on the right day. One of the great pleasures of speaking in Dallas is seeing so many familiar and friendly faces.\n\nI was a member of this group when it was less august and when we always met on Fridays. I remember one particular session some 20-odd years ago, when Ted Strauss introduced his brother Bob. They were vintage performances by both Strausses: Ted gave an intro that was longer than Bob’s speech and, being an erudite fellow, was all over the map. In fact, Ted’s introduction was so long that Ambassador Strauss said, “I hadn’t realized Ted was going to provide a (expletive deleted) travelogue, so in the few seconds remaining, I better just get to the point and tell you what I came here to say.”\n\nGray Mayes has provided a nice introduction, yet kindly kept it short. But I still think I’ll keep to Bob Strauss’ form and just get down to what I came here to say. I will speak, as always, only for myself and not for any other senior official at the Fed or for my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nWe cannot fully understand the U.S. economy without appreciating how it interacts with the rest of the world. We live in an era of globalization, and policymakers in both the political and monetary realms must come to grips with this if we are to fulfill our mandates and do what is expected of us.\n\nGlobalizing economies are increasingly open to movements of goods, services, capital, people and ideas across borders. Citizens and companies do not seek to do business in far-away places for the sheer adventure of it. They do it because it makes them better off. This is the natural process of capitalism, constrained by the cost of transport and information and accelerated by technologies that make it cheaper to move goods, services and ideas. Globalization will proceed apace unless or until the governmental authorities intervene to stop it.\n\nA few numbers tell the story of the world’s march toward globalization:\n\nGlobalization generates controversy. It unleashes competition and accelerates the forces of creative destruction, to borrow the term coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter. In this turbulent sea of change, there are challenges and opportunities. Business leaders confront them every day. The men and women who manage America’s businesses—the busy fingers of Adam Smith’s fabled invisible hand—work 24/7 to hone their companies’ productivity and competitiveness. They get it: They understand that America’s workers and businesses cannot prosper by shrinking from the demands of globalization or hiding behind protectionist barriers.\n\nMany analysts highlight the benefits of globalization to the private sector—not only the strength that competition builds but also the gains from trade, specialization and productivity that come with expanding markets. This is so widely written about now that it is almost old hat. I did not come to speak to you today about this dimension of globalization. You already know it because you practice it. Instead, I thought I would speak to you today about globalization and the public sector.\n\nToday, the Dallas Fed is issuing its 2005 annual report. It includes some data that will give you a good fix on some of what we do. In addition to supervising and regulating banks, we processed almost a billion checks worth $900 billion last year and paid out and received 5.4 billion in circulating notes worth $92 billion. Money is the economy’s lifeblood. Federal Reserve Banks are critical to maintaining the payments system and keeping the capillaries, veins and arteries of the economy’s cardiovascular system operating efficiently.\n\nI want to draw your attention to a punchy essay in the annual report that analyzes the interplay of globalization and public policy. Its title gives away our conclusion: Racing to the Top: How Global Competition Disciplines Public Policy. In short, we found strong correlation between increasing globalization and measures that promote faster growth, lower inflation, higher incomes and greater economic freedom.\n\nThe economic logic is straightforward. Competition brings benefits to the public sector the same way it does the private sector. Because factors of production are increasingly mobile in an era of globalization, governments vie to gain and hold onto them. Mobile factors will flee economies that burden them with high taxes, excessive regulation and capricious administration. They gravitate toward countries that offer the best opportunities to increase profits or paychecks. The economic benefits of productive factors give nations strong incentives to maintain or adopt better economic policies.\n\nOur study uses the globalization index devised by A.T. Kearney and Foreign Policy magazine, which ranks roughly 60 countries from the most to least globalized. It includes cross-border trade and investment as well as measures for technologies that shrink the world, people-to-people connections and government participation in the global community. The United States is the fourth most globalized country in the world, behind Singapore, Switzerland and Ireland. Iran comes in last.\n\nWe looked at how the countries in the A.T. Kearney/Foreign Policy index fared on 18 measures of public policy, all from such well-respected sources as the World Bank, the Fraser Institute of Canada, the Heritage Foundation, Harvard University and Transparency International. The mashing of all these numbers yielded some interesting results that shed light on the debate about globalization.\n\nOverall, we found a strong correlation between globalization and better policies. As nations become more globalized, they tend to be more open to international trade, maintaining lower tariffs and reducing other barriers. They are more open to foreign capital, allowing foreigners to participate in their economies as direct and portfolio investors. Increasing globalization is associated with fewer and better-administered regulations, a more favorable corporate tax environment and policies that stimulate innovation.\n\nIn countries with a higher degree of globalization, you also find policies supporting more accountability in the private and public sectors. These nations are more likely to maintain courts that recognize property rights and enforce the rule of law. Their governments are more effective and less corrupt. Policies in these more globalized countries tend to be more stable, an important consideration for the long-term planning needed for business.\n\nAs a central banker, I am particularly interested in our study’s implications for monetary policy. Inflation is the central banker’s nemesis—the Lex Luthor of the monetary realm. It robs money of its purchasing power. It cripples the poor and destroys the purchasing power of the elderly and others who live on fixed incomes. It erodes incentives to work and save. And it debases investment. Let inflation get out of control, and in no time, a dollar invested becomes a quarter earned.\n\nToday, money is probably the most mobile factor of production. In a nanosecond, it can scurry to any part of the world with just a squeak of a computer mouse. Nations that fail to control inflation will find they cannot retain their own capital or attract money from other countries, except at high interest rates. They end up not only with high inflation but also with lower investment, higher interest rates and slower growth.\n\nMost countries want to avoid these outcomes. They want to retain capital and attract it from other countries. Low inflation helps them do so. Over the past 30 years, there has been a marked decline in inflation across the world—particularly among the nations most integrated into the world economy. We found that inflation descended in stair-step fashion in the period from 2001 to 2003. It averaged 10 percent among the least globalized quarter of nations in our study, then fell to 6.2 percent for the next quartile of globalized nations, 3.1 percent for the third quartile and 2.3 percent among the most globalized quartile.\n\nNot every government policy has improved with globalization. For example, our study found no evidence of increasing globalization and fiscal restraint. Governments tend to get bigger as nations become more interconnected to the world economy. Public transfers and subsidies increasingly pervade nations as they globalize, and personal income taxes become more burdensome as well. Why does fiscal policy respond little to globalization? We do not have a definite answer, but perhaps it is because these nations are richer and have the means to spread those riches through their societies.\n\nGovernment labor policies also seem sticky, if not quite immune, when it comes to dealing with the forces of international competition. Except for the top quarter of globalized nations, labor market flexibility does not generally improve as economies open up to the rest of the world. As long as workers refuse to acknowledge they are competing in a global economy, they will petition wealthy governments to protect their jobs. Labor market rigidities slow job growth and raise unemployment, in turn creating a greater demand for expensive and expansive safety nets for idle workers.\n\nThe recent demonstrations in France show the political difficulty of enacting even relatively modest changes in regulations that hamstring hiring and firing, raise costs and increase unemployment. Yesterday, the French government yielded to those protests, withdrawing the proposed reforms. Perhaps it is an overly optimistic view, but I am encouraged that the French government recognized that restoring competitiveness requires loosening of the country’s labor laws. And not all French youths were protesting the proposed new law. Some of them were in other countries—at jobs that are not available in France. Boris Mollereau, just 27 years old and a business school graduate, moved to London to find work, making him a mobile factor, if ever there was one. Listen to what he had to say in this morning’s Financial Times: “Here, I might lose my job more easily, but I can find another job just as easily. French people don’t realize that a robust job market is in itself a form of job protection.”\n\nCould it be said any better?\n\nOther countries, including Germany, have also come to realize the importance of nimble labor markets in today’s ever more connected world. They are beginning to enact reforms. You cannot stop firms from seeking the best workers for the money, wherever they may be found, especially as advances in telecommunications and transportation and inventory and supply chain management bring the world closer together. Labor’s best option in a globalized world is to adapt, compete and get stronger.\n\nWith the important exceptions of fiscal and labor policies, our study concludes that globalization is associated with better policies. Of course, there is a chicken-and-egg problem in discerning whether globalization improves public policy or whether nations that improve their policies succeed in becoming more globalized. It is probably both. We should celebrate, not denigrate, globalization. In general, it is associated with better government policies, ones that lead to higher living standards and greater economic freedom.\n\nThank you."

        "content": "April 5, 2006 La Jolla, California\n\nEstimados amigos, gracias por la oportunidad de hablarles sobre la economía del país donde pasé mi juventud—un país que ocupa un lugar especial en mi corazón. Cuando mis padres llegaron de Sudáfrica en 1939, las autoridades de los Estados Unidos no los dejaron entrar. Entonces, ellos se fueron a México. Vivieron ocho años en Tijuana, cruzando la frontera varias veces a pie, hasta que se hicieron ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos en 1947. Es por eso que con mucho orgullo nos hacemos llamar “gringos mojados.”\n\nYo nací en Los Angeles en 1949. Después de mi nacimiento, fuimos a vivir a la ciudad de México. Tuve el privilegio de cursar la escuela primaria en el Distrito Federal. Fueron años preciosos e inolvidables.\n\nPorfirio Díaz mencionó alguna vez: “Pobre México: tan lejos de Dios y tan cerca de los Estados Unidos.” Poor Mexico: so far from God and so close to the United States.\n\nI don’t think this is at all true. Mexico is, of course, joined at the hip with the United States—and Texas and California, too, for that matter—and it is a good thing for all of us. As for being distant from God, though, I doubt it. Let me share a story my father told me upon our return to the United States. I had been put back a year in school because my English was not up to par.\n\nMy father’s story imagined a conference of the great leaders of various religious denominations. It included the evangelical preachers, the archbishops of the Catholic Church, the most respected rabbis and the few imams you could find at the time. Never before had there been such an assemblage of spiritual leaders.\n\nInto their midst wandered a small child, an innocent, who asked the religious men a question of great theological import: “Who is special in the eyes of the Lord? Is it the little children? Is it the Israelites? The people who wander the great deserts? The poor and the downtrodden? Who is it, really?”\n\n“Well, little girl,” the clerics responded, “you know the Lord plays no favorites. He loves all. But don’t take our word for it. We will ask Him. Come, let us pray and ask the Lord to send us a sign as to whom He smiles upon.”\n\nThey got on their knees. They bowed their heads. And the great men reverently asked the Lord to send the child a signal—“Just a sign, dear Lord, a simple expression, as to who among the peoples of the world you especially favor.”\n\nAt first there was no answer.\n\nAnd then a bolt of lightning parted the skies. The sun shone brightly. And a booming voice came down from the heavens: “Bu-e-nos dias….”\n\nThis evening, I am going to give you a straightforward brief on Mexico’s economic progress and predicament as I see them. Lo voy a hacer principalmente en ingles ya que tenemos miembros de la prensa que no hablan español. My perspective is forged in part by the four years I spent negotiating trade and market liberalization with Mexico. The views I am going to express are just that: my personal expression, backed by the research of our able economists of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District. These views are not those of any other Federal Open Market Committee members or Federal Reserve officials.\n\nI want to cover monetary policy—no surprise there. After that, I will take up Mexico’s financial situation as we approach the end of the current sexenio and this summer’s elections. Stepping back for a longer-term view, I will then discuss some challenges to Mexico’s economic prosperity. If I pass over anything too quickly or leave anything out, we might take it up in the question and answer period.\n\nI start with monetary policy because it is my firm belief that economies cannot achieve sustainable growth without monetary discipline. Furthermore, I believe that monetary discipline cannot be sustained without an independent central bank. We live in a globalized world. Capital, labor and ideas are freer than ever to migrate to places where they will earn the best return. A country that debases the returns to those inputs cannot expect to retain them and harness them to work on behalf of its people.\n\nPresident Zedillo and his successors in the Fox administration understood well the need to bolster Mexico’s competitiveness. Safeguarding Mexico’s economic health is also manifest in the superb leadership exhibited by Guillermo Ortíz at Banco de México and Francisco Gil Díaz at Hacienda. Together, they have been the Batman and Robin of Mexico, as good a combination of central banker and finance minister as has been seen in the Americas since the tandem of Alan Greenspan and Bob Rubin.\n\nA critical ingredient in Mexico’s monetary policy success has been the establishment of a fully independent central bank that makes controlling inflation its main goal. Central bank independence is protected by Article 28 of the constitution, which was amended in 1994 to read:\n\nThese are magic words. With a clearly stated goal and constitutional protection, Banco de México under Governor Ortíz has become a no-nonsense practitioner of inflation targeting. As a result, Mexico now boasts its lowest inflation in 30 years, with consumer prices rising at around 3 percent a year.\n\nThis is a monumental accomplishment. Inflation is an onerous tax and a disincentive to work, save and invest. In an economy plagued by rising prices, a dollar saved ends up a quarter earned, a fact that does not change if you deal in pesos and centavos. Some cynics worry that a new Mexican administration might decide to interfere with the central bank’s independence. It would prove very difficult to do so. Modifying Article 28 to reduce Banco de México’s independence would require going through the amendment process defined in Article 135. This would entail (1) the agreement of two-thirds of Congress and (2) the approval of a majority of the state legislatures. Given Mexico’s divided polity, this is highly unlikely.\n\nWith sound management reinforcing the constitutional guarantee of central bank independence, the markets have displayed unprecedented confidence in Mexico. Here is where the treasury comes into the picture. Hacienda has accumulated enough foreign reserves to cover all its overseas obligations over the next two years, which provides strong insurance against the sort of capital outflow Mexico experienced more than a decade ago during the Tequila Crisis.\n\nThis insurance strategy is just a small part of 10 years’ worth of efforts by Mexico’s federal government, under two administrations, to reduce its financial vulnerability. Mexico ran into trouble in 1995 because its debt was (a) large, (b) mostly in foreign hands, (c) mostly short-term and (d) mostly in U.S. dollars. Mexico has been able to address all four sources of vulnerability in large part as a consequence of cleaning up its fiscal and monetary houses.\n\nMexico’s government is now able to rely mainly on domestic lenders. Three-fifths of net public-sector debt is now held by Mexican nationals, compared with a third in 1995. Mexico is also able to issue debt with much longer maturities. The country began issuing 20-year bonds in 2003. In 1995, its longest bond was a one-year bono. It would not surprise me at all if Mexico were to follow the example Russia set in February and issue a 30-year, peso-denominated bond in the near future.\n\nConfidence in Mexico’s financial markets has been reinforced by the stability and strength of the peso. The Tequila Crisis of 1994–95 started with a sharp currency devaluation. Mexico simply could no longer defend a fixed value of the peso. That is ancient history now. The peso has been floating for more than a decade, another factor easing markets’ fears about the potential for a financial crisis this year.\n\nWhat are the markets saying now? Foreign investors do not appear concerned about the upcoming presidential election becoming a breeding ground for an end-of-sexenio crisis. Mexico’s country premium—the added interest it must pay on its debt relative to comparable U.S. instruments—is near all-time lows.\n\nOf course, markets can be rational but at other times appear capricious. When interest rates are low, investors typically “reach for yield” by crawling out along the yield curve. When yield curves are flat or offer insufficient extra yield at longer maturities, investors can alternatively reach for yield by assuming greater credit risk and lending to lower-rated borrowers. If investors underestimate the amount of risk they are taking, subsequent disappointment may prove disruptive as sudden price swings cause investment holdings to turn unprofitable and investors seek to reduce positions.\n\nOf late, we have seen a predictable response to the tightening pursued by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. While the Bank of Japan has technically not tightened policy, the end of the quantitative easing policy is a significant move in this direction. By implication, investors have to reach less far than previously to obtain reasonable yields. As a consequence, emerging market bond spreads have risen slightly, admittedly from very low levels. In addition, the currencies of several high-yield issuers have notably depreciated over the past month. Some examples include the Icelandic krona, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Turkish lira, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars.\n\nMy personal experience as a funds manager taught me at least two things: first, to respect the bond markets. You may recall James Carville’s quip that before he went to Washington with President Clinton, he thought the most powerful force in the world was the presidency or perhaps the papacy, but he quickly came to realize that it was the bond market.\n\nAndrew Mellon may have gotten it right when he said, “Gentlemen prefer bonds.” But a gentleman spurned can be unforgiving.\n\nThe second lesson I learned as a funds manager is that all financial markets, including those for fixed income and foreign exchange, can be somewhat manic-depressive. Markets can become skittish and are capable of overshooting on both the high and low ends. This is one reason I support the recent trend in increased central bank transparency, which reduces the elements of surprise that can unsettle markets. If the current environment of rising yields of relatively risk-free credits continues, there is a possibility that markets for emerging-country debt will become skittish. If so, even minor market-related developments may induce short-run volatility in those credits. Authorities in these countries will have to be increasingly sensitive about embracing policies or undertaking actions that might exacerbate that volatility.\n\nAgainst that background, we might now look at July’s presidential election. The presidential pyramid famously described by Octavio Paz has been turned upside down. Under the old system of PRI dominance, el presidente had near dictatorial and unassailable powers. This is no longer so, and from the standpoint of financial markets, I would posit that this is good news. Central bank independence, greater freedom of the press, an increasingly assertive Supreme Court and a divided Congress mean that whoever assumes office after the elections will have limited scope to single-handedly impose change.\n\nThe consensus view in financial markets is that rhetoric aside, none of the three presidential candidates is likely to reconsider Mexico’s commitment to macroeconomic discipline once in office. To be sure, the PRI and PRD have complained that monetary policy is “too tight,” but both parties appear to understand the importance of monetary discipline in keeping inflation under wraps. Any of the three candidates, once in office, should value the hard-earned financial stability of the previous administration and seek to build upon it. This is comforting.\n\nStability is critical to continued structural reform in Mexico. A look at the country’s ability to compete in the world economy is sufficient to understand how far it has to go. In its most recent competitiveness rankings, the Geneva-based International Institute for Management Development put Mexico near the bottom—56th out of 60, surpassing only Venezuela, Indonesia, Argentina and Poland. Mexico’s low productivity growth of only about 1.2 percent a year over the past decade is symptomatic of the problem.\n\nIn our increasingly globalized world, competitiveness is becoming more important. It is also becoming more complex. Gone are the days when a simple advantage in, say, labor costs or geography will be enough to attract foreign capital. Investors in today’s shrinking, interconnected world seek out countries that offer cost advantages, but they also seek out high levels of education and human capital, sound and reliable institutions, and other requisites for sustained long-run growth.\n\nOn the human capital side of the equation, Mexico has made great progress in the past few decades by increasing school enrollment and improving facilities. Nevertheless, many problems remain with regard to both the availability and quality of public education. More than half of adult Mexicans have no secondary schooling at all, and only 11.3 percent have any college or university training. Mexican adults have on average attended school for just 6.7 years, about half the U.S. level.\n\nRecognizing this fact, the Mexican government has ratcheted up education outlays in recent years, aiming to improve the nation’s schools. Spending per primary- and secondary-school student rose 21 percent in real terms between 1995 and 2002. Still, it remains low by international standards. Measured in purchasing power parity dollars, Mexico spent $1,467 per primary-school student in 2002, compared with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average of $5,313 and the U.S. average of $8,049. Moreover, Mexican students’ math and reading scores rank dead last among the OECD countries and lag severely even when compared with those of other nations with similar educational spending, such as the Slovak Republic.\n\nThere are, of course, limits on how much Mexico’s government—or any government, for that matter—can increase spending on education. We know from our problems with education in the United States that added dollars or pesos may not produce results unless accompanied by innovative reforms. In Mexico’s case, experts believe such reforms should include improved school administration, better monitoring and incentives, and modernization of curricula and teaching techniques.\n\nThe Zedillo and Fox administrations recognized that better education is vital to the human-capital improvements that lead to greater labor productivity and competitiveness. But Mexico has only begun the task. I would expect the next government to continue emphasizing the need for improving the educational system.\n\nFrom a competitiveness standpoint, of course, spending on schools only pays off to the extent the economy puts educated workers to efficient use. Much of the inefficiency can be found in the sprawling informal sector, which employs roughly half of Mexico’s 44 million workers. A dual labor market has its pluses. The informal sector creates jobs for low-skilled workers, many of whom are priced out of the formal market. It is also home to most of Mexico’s entrepreneurs—self-employed and often industrious individuals who choose not to navigate the labyrinth of taxes and regulations that govern the formal market.\n\nInformality, however, also has negative implications. The small tax base increases tax rates on compliant firms, and this is both distortionary and unfair. In addition, informality limits firm size and undermines economies of scale. Companies find it difficult to grow, not only because they have little access to financial markets but also because the tax man eventually catches up with larger enterprises. In the end, small is safe but inefficient.\n\nFirms in the formal sector contend with other barriers. Mexican law and convention often constrain employers in how they organize production. Labor rules, for example, dictate that workers must be paid by the day or week, not by the hour. After three months of employment, a worker typically becomes “tenured.” Reducing the ranks of tenured employees is very costly; according to the World Bank, dismissal costs in Mexico equal about 75 weeks of pay. When it comes to international comparisons of labor-market rigidity, the only region of the world scoring worse than Mexico is sub-Saharan Africa. While employment in the formal sector is hog-tied with red tape, workers in the informal sector go without any protections at all. Thus, labor-market reform will be a high priority of the next administration. Whatever changes are eventually adopted, the ultimate goal should be to even the playing field by making the formal sector more accessible and less costly.\n\nNo manner of labor-market reform, of course, is going to keep Mexicans from seeking a better life on this side of the border. U.S. demographers estimate that 400,000 Mexicans migrate to the United States each year, legally and otherwise. A majority of them are seeking jobs. With about 9 million Mexican workers in the United States, the equivalent of 15 percent of Mexico’s labor force is employed here.\n\nOver the past two decades, the U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere for labor-force growth. In the 1960s, baby boomers contributed heavily to expanding labor supply. In the 1970s and early 1980s, it was the rapid entry of women into the workforce. Since the mid-1980s, it has been immigrants. In the past few years, foreign-born workers have accounted for more than half of U.S. labor-force growth, providing an important impetus for our economic growth. The subject of immigration is one that inflames passions on both sides of the border. For our part, we must be careful that legitimate security concerns do not interfere with the economic benefits of immigration.\n\nOf course, goods and services, as well as people, cross the border. You know the numbers. Since NAFTA took effect, U.S. trade with Mexico has risen 250 percent. Yet, neither Mexico nor the United States has done enough to handle the growing traffic. Surface trade is still much more inefficient and costly with Mexico than with Canada. The situation has become even more complex since the 9/11 tragedy increased the need for national security at our borders.\n\nFor Mexico and the U.S. states along its border, the stakes are high. Geographic proximity to the United States and ease of transport are key aspects of Mexico’s comparative advantage vis-à-vis nations in Asia and Eastern Europe. A loss of competitiveness in Mexico is a loss for the entire border economy, where so much of our growth is linked to expansion on the more populous Mexican side. We must pay greater attention to the changes in infrastructure, regulations and other areas that are needed to maximize mutual economic benefit from trade.\n\nDespite the impressive gains in U.S.–Mexico trade, old barriers persist and new obstacles have been erected. Shippers and visitors pay a huge cost in time and money for bottlenecks at the border. Examples include restricted movement of commercial vehicles, Mexican customs brokers’ practices, inadequate agency staffing and inspection facilities, and cumbersome U.S. customs processing and inspections. These transaction costs reduce the volume of trade and traffic and increase prices for traded goods. For example, about 47 percent of trucks cross the border empty—even empty trucks have to pass inspection—so this slows down the border crossing process. The U.S. Transportation Department estimates that cargo headed for the Mexican interior spends three to five days in a border warehouse before being released to continue its southbound journey. Both producers and consumers bear the burden of the higher transaction costs, and the U.S.–Mexico trade relationship is harmed. Solutions to the bottlenecks in cross-border transportation require changes in government and business practices on both sides.\n\nBefore closing, I want to discuss the need for reform in two other areas—the judiciary and the energy sector. Bluntly stated, Mexico’s court system does not typically function in a way that creates an environment favorable to lending and investment. Most critical for economic growth, property rights are often not effectively enforced in Mexico. According to the World Bank, average commercial dispute resolution time—how long it takes from the filing of a lawsuit to payment—is 421 days in Mexico, compared with 226 days in the other OECD countries.\n\nThis state of affairs has a number of consequences. First and foremost, banks and other financial institutions are reluctant to lend in an environment where contracts are difficult to enforce. Although credit has been expanding faster over the past two years, particularly in the consumer and residential segments, Mexico continues to have one of the world’s smallest financial sectors. The ratio of private loans to GDP is 10 times lower in Mexico than it is in the United States. If you factor in financial markets, there is more than 15 times more financial intermediation in the United States than in Mexico.\n\nThe factors that restrict access to capital hinder Mexico’s ability to grow. Weak enforcement also encourages resources to shift to the informal sector, which accounts for an estimated one-third of the overall economy’s output. Operating in the formal sector and abiding by labor laws and the tax code is costly. In most countries, a firm is partly “compensated” for assuming these burdens by gaining access to formal sources of financing, such as bank loans and export finance. In Mexico, however, outside financing is difficult to come by for most firms, even if they choose to operate in the formal sector. This further decreases incentives to follow the rules.\n\nThe Mexican government is aware of this problem and is improving matters. Bankruptcy and lending reforms adopted in 2000 and 2003 made it easier for creditors to collect debts in cases of insolvency by creating Mexico’s first effective legal framework for granting collateral. As welcome as these and other recent reforms are, they address only part of the issue. Mexico’s main problem is that its laws are often not well enforced. Having a reliable and transparent judiciary to enforce commercial as well as criminal law is a requirement for sustained growth in any country.\n\nAnother key element to economic success is infrastructure, an area in which Mexico needs further improvement. Necessary investments are hindered by lack of both funds and alternative providers. In the energy and electricity sectors, production and distribution are largely controlled by the public sector. Not surprisingly, given Mexico’s limited ability to raise taxes, capacity expansion has not kept pace with demand, and manufacturers and households must cope with frequent power interruptions. Meaningful energy reform will have to involve Pemex, a public-sector institution that has long been seen not only as a cash cow but as a politically sacred cow. Competition remains limited in other key industries as well. In the telecommunications sector, Telmex continues to control nearly 95 percent of all phone lines in Mexico. It should come as no surprise, then, that Mexico’s phone charges are among the world’s highest.\n\nMy friends, time is short. I think I have laid out enough challenges to keep Mexico very busy for at least another sexenio. Before ending, let me remind you of how far the country has come. Just the fact that we now compare it to other developed countries, that we talk about Mexico as one of the world’s most promising economies, is a tremendous change and reflects an incredible achievement. Mexico will face up to these challenges. Macroeconomic stability, out of reach for so long, is allowing Mexico to pursue the necessary reforms. The institutions are now in place for the transformation to really take hold and improve the lot of all Mexicans, más cerca de Dios y más cerca de los Estados Unidos!\n\nMuchas gracias. Thank you."

        "content": "April 4, 2006 Midwestern State University, Wichita Falls, Texas\n\nI am delighted to be back in Wichita Falls. I spent some considerable time here in 1994, when I took leave of my senses and ran for the United States Senate. The good people of this city were always nice to me, especially Dottie Murphy, who is here today—thank you, Dottie. I remember the first time I met your wonderful mother, God rest her soul. She had on a white blouse, a jean skirt and bright red cowboy boots, and she looked a third her age and like the belle of the ball. She was a true Texas gem, and we all miss her.\n\nI ran that one time for office and that was it. Veni, Vidi, Defici: I came, I saw, I lost. It was not my cup of tea; I was no good at it and was a fish—or, I guess you can say, a fisher—out of water. I was better suited for the assignment of ambassador and trade negotiator of the United States. That, in turn, proved to be excellent preparation for what I do today as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and as a participant in the Federal Open Market Committee, the monetary policy setting body of the Federal Reserve System. Today is, in fact, the anniversary of my becoming Dallas Fed president last year. So I thought it might be of interest to share with you what I have gleaned from these past few years and what I am now up to as we speak. Before doing so, let me state at the outset that the views I express today are strictly my own and that I am not speaking for the Federal Open Market Committee or others in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nAnd before getting into my prepared remarks, I want to acknowledge my traveling companion today, Wichita Falls’ and Midwestern’s own James Hoard. James is my right arm at the Fed. He is a superb counselor and friend and does his best to keep me out of trouble. James, raise your hand, so that if I do make any mistakes today, everyone will know who to blame.\n\nOne of my first acts as Dallas Fed president was to challenge our researchers to think deeply about how globalization is changing the ways our economy works—in particular, how we need to alter the rules and practices of monetary policy to accommodate an increasingly interconnected, interdependent global economy.\n\nThe literature on globalization is large. The literature on monetary policy is vast. But literature examining the combination of the two is surprisingly small.\n\nAt year-end last year, if you had Googled “globalization” and “monetary” and “policy,” you would have turned up more than 2 million references. However, a search of scholarly articles with the same word combination turned up 30,700. If you had narrowed your quest to the exact word combination “globalization and monetary policy,” you would have found a mere 39 citations. Limiting the word combination to the title of an article, you would have found only two.\n\nTom Friedman’s popular book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century—a book I’ll bet many of you have read—doesn’t have a single entry on “money,” “monetary policy” or “central banking.” And in Michael Woodford’s influential book Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy—a book you probably haven’t read but should if you delight in economics—the word “globalization” does not appear in the index. Nor do the words “international trade” or “international finance.”\n\nWhat gives? Is the process of globalization disconnected from monetary policy? Is the business of the central bank totally divorced from globalization?\n\nI think not. I believe globalization and monetary policy are intertwined in a complex narrative that is only beginning to unfold.\n\nThere are many convoluted definitions of globalization. Mine is simple: Globalization means economic potential is no longer constrained by political and geographic boundaries. A globalized world is one where goods, services, capital, money, workers and ideas migrate to wherever they are most valued and can work together most efficiently, flexibly and securely.\n\nWhere does monetary policy come into play in this world? Well, consider the task of the central banker, seeking to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum sustainable non-inflationary growth.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Governor Larry Meyer gave an insider’s view of the process in his excellent little book A Term at the Fed. It was one of the first things I read as I prepared for my new job. In it, you get a good sense of the lexicon of monetary policy deliberations. The language of Fedspeak is full of sacrosanct terms, such as “output gap” and “capacity constraints.” There is the “natural rate of unemployment,” which morphed into “the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment,” or “NAIRU.” Central bankers want GDP to run at no more than its theoretical limit, for growing too fast for too long might stoke the fires of inflation. They do not wish to strain the economy’s capacity to produce.\n\nOne key capacity factor is the labor pool. A shibboleth known as the Phillips curve posits that unemployment falling beneath a certain level ignites demand for greater pay, with inflationary consequences for the entire economy.\n\nUntil recently, the econometric calculations of the various capacity constraints and gaps of the U.S. economy were based on assumptions of a world that exists no more. Meyer’s book is a real eye-opener because it describes in great detail the learning process of the FOMC members as the U.S. economy entered a new economic environment in the second half of the 1990s. At the time, economic growth was strong and accelerating. The unemployment rate was low, approaching levels unseen since the 1960s. In these circumstances, inflation was supposed to rise—if you believed in the Phillips curve and the prevailing views of potential output growth, capacity constraints and the NAIRU. That is what the models used by the Federal Reserve staff were saying, as was Meyer himself, joined by nearly all the other Fed governors and presidents gathered around the FOMC table. Under the circumstances, they concluded that monetary policy needed to be tightened to head off the inevitable. They were frustrated by Chairman Greenspan’s insistence they postpone the rate hikes.\n\nWe now recognize with 20/20 hindsight that Greenspan was the first to grasp changes in the traditional relationships among economic variables. The former chairman understood the data and the Fed staff’s modeling techniques, but he was also constantly talking—and listening—to business leaders. And they were telling him they were simply doing their job of seeking any and all means of earning a return for shareholders. At the time, they were being enabled by new technologies that enhanced productivity. The Information Age had begun rewriting their operations manuals. Earnings were being leveraged by technological advances. Productivity was surging. Inflation wasn’t rising. Indeed, it just kept on falling.\n\nIf the advice of Meyer and the others had prevailed, the Fed would have caused the economy to seriously underperform. According to some back-of-the-envelope calculations by economists I respect, real GDP would have been lower by several hundred billion dollars. Employment gains would have been reduced by perhaps a million jobs. The costs of not being right on the critical calibrations of monetary policy would have been huge.\n\nWe live in a globalizing era. Just consider what the fall of the Soviet Union, the implementation of Deng Xiaoping’s “capitalist road” in China and India’s embrace of market reforms mean to business operators. Consider labor alone. In the early ’90s, the former Soviet Union released millions of hungry workers into the system. China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century and injected 750 million workers into play. And now India, with over 100 million English-speaking workers among its 1 billion people, has joined the game. Just two weeks ago, a CEO told me his company posted ads for people to apply for 9,000 jobs in a new facility in India. Do you know how many applications they received?—1,400,000.\n\nHow does this affect the American manager—paid to enhance returns to shareholders by growing revenues at the lowest possible costs? Because labor accounts for, on average, about two-thirds of the cost of producing most goods and services, the managers will go where labor is plentiful and cheapest. They will have a widget made in China or Vietnam, or a software program written in Russia or Estonia, or a center for processing calls or managing a back office set up in India.\n\nLet me tell you of one eye-opening experience. About two years ago, I was in London on business for Kissinger McLarty. I received a call from the head of Japan’s equivalent of the Business Roundtable, the Keidanren, asking me to “pop over tomorrow to give a luncheon and dinner speech.” They made an offer I couldn’t refuse, and I said I would be glad to do it if they could arrange the flights. They booked me on Virgin Air and arranged for a car to take me to Heathrow. At the appointed time, the car didn’t show up. So I called the number I had been given. The call was answered by a woman with a frightfully British accent. When I asked, “Could you kindly tell me where my car is, ma’am?” she deftly shifted to a Southwestern American accent and said, “Now don’t you worry. It is five minutes away. Ah apologize for the delay. Have a nice flight.”\n\nI said, “Well, hold on a minute. You answered this call in a British accent but once I spoke, you shifted to a Texas accent. Who are you? Where are you?”\n\n“Well,” she answered, “I am a call center operator in Bangalore.”\n\n“Have you ever been to the United States?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, no, sir. But I can tell that you are from Arkansas, Texas or New Mexico.”\n\n“And how do you learn to speak like me?”\n\n“Well, sir, for people like you, we watch a telly show called Walker, Texas Ranger.”\n\n“And what if I were from Boston?”\n\n“Ah, for those people we watch Cheers.”\n\nIt may seem like a small matter that a Japanese firm employed a worker in India to track a car by GPS in London and mimic a voice from Texas. But globalization impacts the conduct of business so much more profoundly, and therefore it impacts the expansion of our productive capacity and the pricing mechanism of labor and other inputs.\n\nThe destruction of communism and the creation of vast new sources of inputs and production have upset all the calculations and equations of the very best economics minds, including those of the Federal Reserve staff. Many of the old models simply do not apply in the new real world. This is why I think so many economists have been so baffled by the length of the current business cycle as well as the non-inflationary prosperity we have enjoyed for almost two decades.\n\nYou could sense something was wrong with the econometric equations if you listened to the troops on the ground, fighting in the trenches of the marketplace. This is what I did at the U.S. Trade Representative’s office in negotiating market-opening trade rounds with China, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil and others. It is what my colleagues and I at Kissinger McLarty did while advising dozens of U.S. companies seeking entry into China and the former Soviet satellites and India and Latin America. It is what my colleagues and I on the FOMC do by making dozens upon dozens of calls to CEOs, COOs and CFOs of businesses, large and small, every month to prepare for FOMC meetings.\n\nWe are simply observing managers at work expanding the capacity of our economy, expanding the gap between what their previously limited resources would allow them to produce and what their newly expanded globalized, technologically enhanced reach now allows them to produce.\n\nFrom this, I personally conclude that we need to redraw the Phillips curve and rejig the equations that inform our understanding of the maximum sustainable levels of U.S. production and growth. How can economists quantify what the U.S. can produce with existing labor and capital when we don’t know the full extent of the global labor pool we can access? Or the totality of the financial and intellectual capital that can be drawn on to produce what we produce?\n\nSo what does the limited research on resource utilization and output gaps tell us? There are a few key, but preliminary findings from work done at the Bank for International Settlements—what many consider “the central bankers’ bank”—and some as yet unpublished work done by several of our Dallas Fed economists. Here are a few key points:\n\nAt first, I was encouraged on hearing these results. But then I was reminded about how difficult it is to accurately measure slack in the U.S. economy in real time. Data revisions in these measurements are often quite large. Imagine how much more difficult it is to measure in real time the degree of slack or capacity utilization that exists across the landscape of, say, 10 other economies across the globe!\n\nThe realization of the importance of global economic conditions for making monetary policy decisions is becoming more widespread. Several of my colleagues on the FOMC have offered encouragement to the globalization research efforts under way at the Dallas Fed. In February, I had the opportunity to give a speech in London and to meet with Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England. Foreign trade has long been important to the prosperity of the U.K. London’s financial markets play a pivotal role in global capitalism. So policymakers in the U.K. are used to thinking globally when it comes to making policy. After a robust conversation with Governor King, it became abundantly clear that we share many views on the importance of globalization for monetary policy. In recent years, globalization has manifested itself in the U.K. in the form of inflows of foreign workers that have alleviated labor market pressures and allowed the Bank of England to keep interest rates at levels lower than might otherwise be the case. Globalization has also shown up in greater external competitive pressures on U.K. firms, and thereby affected the dynamics of inflation in the U.K. Bank of England staff have an ongoing research project to understand the causes of what they refer to as the Great Stability and we refer to as the Great Moderation—the decline in inflation and output volatility that we have seen in many countries in recent years. Globalization is almost surely part of the explanation.\n\nRecognition of the importance of global economic forces for the making of economic policy is not limited to monetary policy. Just last week, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Justice Department decided not to impose any restrictions on the merger of Whirlpool and Maytag, two manufacturers of washing machines and clothes dryers that together control roughly 70 percent of the U.S. market. In the old days, this would be unthinkable. Today, the reason for not being too concerned with the potential for the combined companies to exert monopoly power is fairly straightforward. There are many manufacturers of laundry machines desirous of entering the U.S. market. In other words, there are abundant potential capacity and resources available outside the United States that can, and will likely, offer competition to Whirlpool/Maytag, thereby reducing their power to boost prices.\n\nI freely admit to you that I do not have the answers when it comes to globalization and monetary policy. I do believe that I am asking the right questions, as are my counterparts in many parts of the world. We at the Dallas Fed will continue to explore this topic, and we will share our findings with the public. We will have to, now that I have made them public right here at Midwestern! In fact, we are putting the finishing touches on a new study about how globalization shapes public policies—from innovation to the regulatory environment and quite a bit in between. It is fascinating stuff, and I look forward to sending it to you through James in about a week or so."

        "content": "February 23, 2006 Dallas, Texas\n\nI want to thank the Greater Dallas Asian American Chamber of Commerce for the opportunity to speak here today. I was truly impressed to learn that your organization is the largest Asian-American chamber in the United States, with 1,200 members.\n\nAsian-Americans have achieved remarkable success and are a shining example of what can be achieved in this ongoing, unfinished experiment we call America. If you take a look at the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey, you will see that the average income of Asian households was $56,664—more than $12,000 above the U.S. average of $44,473. But the importance of the Asian-American community is not measured only by income level. You have ties to a wide range of countries where I spent a great deal of time during the second four years of the Clinton administration negotiating market-opening trade agreements—China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, India and many others. The economies of Dallas and of Texas benefit from the presence of the many internationally savvy businesspeople who belong to this chamber.\n\nYou are part of a growing economic connection between Texas and Asia. I am not sure how many of you know that Texas ranks No. 1 among the states in exports—with 14.5 percent of the U.S. total, eclipsing California’s 13 percent. Mexico, of course, is far and away our leading foreign market due to geographic proximity, but Asia has become quite important, too. Overall, nations across the Pacific buy 24 percent of our exports, more than twice Canada’s share. Five of Texas’ top seven overseas markets are in Asia—China, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Japan. China has been Texas’ fastest growing export market since 2002.\n\nTexas’ growing exports are just part of the larger topic I want to talk about today: the global economy and America’s position in it. Before doing so, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer of all Federal Reserve officials and those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee: My views are just that—my own, assisted greatly by the magnificent research team backing me up at the Dallas Fed.\n\nThe U.S. economy is strong and very competitive. The economy is in something of a sweet spot right now. We have faced terrorist attacks and natural disasters, and yet our economy continues to steam along at a pace that forecasters estimate will in this current quarter be somewhere north of 4 percent, net of inflation. A total of 135 million Americans are at work. Unemployment has dropped to 4.7 percent, the lowest rate in four years. The underlying trend of core inflation has been running at roughly 2 percent, despite record-high energy prices.\n\nOur economy is performing well, but we all know about threats to our long-term prosperity and what needs to be done to prevent them from metastasizing. In addition to protecting our nation from Al Qaeda and other aggressors, on top of most lists would be the urgent need to rein in the fiscal deficits, solve the long-term imbalances built into our retirement and health care systems, and repair our educational system.\n\nSome will argue that we also need to protect ourselves from new sources of competition, like China and India. Indeed, there is a movement afoot in the Senate to impose a 27.5 percent levy on $243 billion of Chinese imports; in effect, it seeks to make American consumers and other importers pay a tax of $67 billion to protect themselves from cheap imports from China. Today, I am going to argue that that is precisely the wrong thing to do—not because it is readily transparent that an onerous tax on Chinese imports would be inflationary or because it would simply lead to the displacement of imports from China to other foreign sources, such as Vietnam. The underlying instinct implicit in this proposal—that we must protect ourselves from competition—is, in my humble opinion, faulty. We should embrace competition and exploit it to continue making ourselves even stronger.\n\nBut first, let me put the United States in perspective.\n\nThe United States produces $12.6 trillion a year in goods and services. That is big.\n\nHow big? Well, the Twelfth Federal Reserve District, headquartered in San Francisco, produces more output than all of China. The Eleventh District, headquartered here in Dallas, produces 20 percent more than India.\n\nThe incremental growth of the U.S. economy is in and of itself impressive. Let’s be conservative and assume we grow in 2006 at last year’s estimated rate of 3.5 percent, a rate that stands a good chance of being recalibrated upward when the final numbers are done. Growing at 3.5 percent for a year, we add $440 billion in incremental activity. That exceeds the entire output of all but 15 other countries. Every year, we create the economic equivalent of two Indonesias, three Thailands, four Malaysias or 11 Vietnams. Year, after year, after year.\n\nIn dollar terms, America’s 3.5 percent is equivalent to surges of 16 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.K., 26 percent in China and 70 percent in India.\n\nOf course, our growth is driven by consumption, a significant portion of which is fed by imports, which totaled $2 trillion last year. Our annual imports—what we buy in a single year from abroad—exceed the total output, the GDP, of all but four other countries. Our consumption provides a significant impetus for economic growth in the rest of the world.\n\nWe buy from the world a heck of a lot more than we sell. Last year, the trade deficit was estimated to have been $726 billion, a mighty big amount. A fourth of that was with China.\n\nSome see this as a threat. After the recent trade deficit was announced, the Financial Times of London quoted one commentator as saying, “These exploding deficit numbers are not a sign of strength; they are a sign of weakness. They indicate a slow bleeding at the wrists economically for the United States.”\n\nSome very influential policymakers and analysts, maybe even some of you in this very audience, are tempted to agree.\n\nBefore doing so, I would respectfully suggest that they do some simple math.\n\nLet’s examine the assertion that trade deficits are a sign of weakness by going back to look at what has happened to the U.S. economy since we last ran a trade surplus in 1975. Since that year, we have been running trade deficits that increase with each successive decade: to one-half of 1 percent of GDP in 1980, 1.3 percent of GDP in 1990, 3.9 percent of GDP in 2000 and 5.8 percent of GDP last year.\n\nHas the economy weakened? Here are the numbers. You be the judge.\n\nIn 2005 dollars—that is, adjusted for inflation—per capita GDP in 1975 was $22,383. Today, it’s $42,047.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, per capita disposable personal income in 1975 was $17,019. Today, it’s $30,429.\n\nIn 2005 dollars, mean household net worth was $195,000 at the end of 1975. Today, it’s $434,000.\n\nWhat these numbers tell us is that since 1975, the American people have become better off by a factor of two.\n\nWhat about those among you who are investors? How have you done?\n\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 Index closed 1975 at 90. It closed yesterday over 14 times higher, at 1,292.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed at 852 in 1975. Last night the Dow closed at 11,137.\n\nThe purchasing power of consumers and investors has increased to a far greater degree than just their income levels and net worth because many of the things we buy and use have become better at ever-cheaper prices since 1975.\n\nIn 1975, a 19-inch Sears color TV cost $359.95 and a 25-inch console was $599.95. Today, a 20-inch Magnavox is $118.99 and a Sharp 27-inch model is $200.99. Today’s models have a much better picture, last longer, use less electricity and come with a whole host of added features, such as remote control.\n\nThe first PC, the Apple I computer, sold for $667 in 1976. It ran at the speed of 1 to 2 megahertz and had a 4k memory. Just $500 spent today on, say, a Dell Dimension E310 with a Pentium 4 processor will get you 2.87 billion times the processing power and millions of times the memory, with a free flat-panel screen and lots of other features.\n\nIn 1975, when I graduated from Stanford Business School, they didn’t have very sophisticated handheld calculators for financial analysts. In 1981, I bought this little guy, an HP12C calculator, which most investors will tell you is all you need to do the financial calculations of portfolio management. I use it to this day. It cost me $150. A couple of days ago, if you were to have looked on eBay as I did, you could have bought an HP12C for $5.\n\nWhat the numbers tell you is that we are far richer as individuals and as a nation than when we last ran a trade surplus. We are hardly “bleeding at the wrists economically” or becoming weaker as we have incurred trade deficits.\n\nThis is not to say that we can sit back, indifferent to the future. Presently, what we buy—oil from the OPEC countries, consumer electronics from the Asians, foodstuffs from Mexico—comes from countries that are not providing significant outlets at home for investing their savings. To continue to finance our external trade and current account imbalances, we have to be a magnet for the world’s surplus capital, attracting the investment money of those from whom we buy goods and services. The process recycles the money we pay out for purchases abroad back into our economy in the form of investments that make us richer, stronger and better positioned to compete more aggressively in trade markets.\n\nHere is the point: To be able to afford what we consume, we must continually improve ourselves. We must continue moving up the value-added ladder while others replace the work we used to do on the ladder’s lower rungs.\n\nOne of my favorite economists was a Czech-born professor from my alma mater named Joseph Schumpeter. He coined a term that appears to be a contradiction in terms but captures the essence of what is required to succeed in a fiercely competitive world: “creative destruction.” The United States has harnessed this process and made it work to constantly improve our global economic standing. Americans are masters of creative destruction.\n\nWhat do I mean when I say that? Well, let’s go back to the original expression of the term.\n\nIn his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter wrote the following: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization…[and] incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is … what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nIn his book, Business Cycles, Schumpeter wrote: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nHere is where China and India and all the bristling new economic entrants come in. They are today’s equivalent of Schumpeter’s railroads. They and the phenomenon of globalization are agents of creative destruction writ large. From now on, hardly any way of doing things which used to be optimal will ever be so again.\n\nCreative destruction is by no means painless. Let’s go back to 1975 again.\n\nSince 1975, as we started down the path of running ever-larger trade deficits, over 141 million Americans have filed unemployment claims. If you assume that there are others who either didn’t qualify to file or didn’t bother, you might reasonably conclude that 175 million jobs have been lost since 1975. That is the destructive side of creative destruction. That is the painful side for people like my dad who lost their jobs and more than once had to retrain for another one.\n\nBut then the creative side steps forward. Since 1975, the economy has replaced the jobs lost and more, adding another 57 million net new jobs to accommodate youth entering the workforce, a surge in immigrants and—very important—significant numbers of women who joined and enriched the workplace. This is the gratifying part of the process. This is the good news. If we create the conditions to let our private sector do what it does by its very nature—constantly adapt and reposition itself—then we have nothing to fear from competition from our trading partners, including those with whom we presently run big deficits.\n\nWe do, indeed, have some tough competitors out there.\n\nBut we have some unique advantages.\n\nAmerica’s economy encourages change. We provide a healthy environment to nurture entrepreneurs. We have not saddled the private sector with regulations that interfere with hiring and firing or dictate outmoded methods of production.\n\nConsider this: Starting a business takes five days in the United States, compared with 45 days in Germany, 108 in Spain and no one knows how many in China. We let labor, capital and companies compete—within the country and with the rest of the world. Our economy continually reorganizes itself to take advantage of new technologies, freeing labor from old jobs so it can move to new, higher-value uses.\n\nThe agent of reorganization is not the government or the central bank but the talent of our business managers, something that economists rarely talk about. These managers are the key to our continued adaptation and growth. They are our greatest comparative advantage.\n\nI like to say that the managers in our business community serve as the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching capitalism’s fingers into every corner of the world to extract value at the lowest cost—in order to enhance productivity.\n\nI am not talking just about CEOs who get paid big bucks. I am talking about the millions of middle managers who operate supply chains, control inventories and fine-tune operations.\n\nEvery day, these managers get up and go to work to exploit those competitors who come to market with cheaper products by buying those products and using them as inputs for providing better deals to their customers.\n\nThey are the masters of the best manifestation of “creative destruction.”\n\nThey are the folks who exert the gravitational pull for the recycling of those monies we pay out to secure cheaper inputs. Their ability to wring value out of all sources, everywhere, is what makes the United States the preferred risk-adjusted destination for surplus investment monies.\n\nThey are the people who enable us to finance our external deficits, and inevitably redress them.\n\nThey are the key to our transforming what some perceive as a weakness into a fundamental strength.\n\nAs long as the Federal Reserve does its job of holding inflation at bay, and as long as our political leaders resist protectionism and let the private sector get on with its work, we will remain the world’s predominant economic machine. If we resort to protectionism and other forms of interference with creative destruction, then we will indeed be slitting our own wrists, draining the world of the lifeblood of U.S. economic growth."

        "content": "February 14, 2006 Little Rock\n\nI spent three years negotiating trade agreements around the world for President Clinton, whom I first met when he was governor, right here in Little Rock. My oldest son was an intern in Mack McLarty’s office when he was chief of staff to the president, and after my work as a trade representative, I had the pleasure of being Mack’s partner in his venture with Henry Kissinger.\n\nThis is all by way of saying that the president and Mack taught me a lot about Arkansas.\n\nThat Patmos, with a population, I recall, of 32, is the smallest town in Arkansas—unless two or three die or move out of Oakhaven.\n\nThat Hope is the state’s heart and Little Rock the brains and that Bentonville, as anybody who shops knows, has a whole lot of muscle.\n\nThat Blanchard Springs Caverns in Stone County ought to be one of the Ten Natural Wonders of the World.\n\nThat the Razorbacks ought to be another one.\n\nI like Mack so much that I would always just grin at him and nod when he bragged on Arkansas. And no matter who the president is, Democrat or Republican, you almost always say, “Yes, sir, Mr. President.”\n\nBut I hope you will forgive me for telling you that I drew the line at their referring to the great state of Texas as “Baja Arkansas,” refusing to do so even when Mack would put me in a hammerlock and give me noogies.\n\nLet’s just say that on a beautiful, springlike day like this, reading about those snowstorms up East in this morning’s Democrat-Gazette, Arkansans and Texans are one and the same at having been blessed to be joined at the hip, right here in the sweet spot of America.\n\nI want to talk to you today about the global economy and America’s position within it. Before doing so, I’ll issue the standard disclaimer of all Federal Reserve officials and those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee: My views are just that—my own, assisted greatly by the magnificent research team I have backing me up in Dallas.\n\nI will give you the bottom line up front: The U.S. economy is strong and very competitive. The economy is in a sweet spot of its own, thanks to private-sector leadership. One hundred and thirty-five million Americans are at work. Unemployment has dropped to 4.7 percent, the lowest rate in four years. We have faced terrorist attacks and natural disasters, and yet our economy continues to steam along at a pace that the consensus of economists estimates will be somewhere north of 4 percent in this current quarter, after netting out inflation, which we have maintained at or near the 2 percent level despite record-high energy prices.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, as your central bank, is and will remain ever vigilant in pursuing its mandate of providing the monetary policy required for sustainable non-inflationary growth.\n\nThat said, we all know what the threats are to our long-term prosperity and what needs to be done to prevent them from metastasizing. In addition to protecting our nation from Al Qaeda and other aggressors, on top of most lists would be the urgent need to rein in the fiscal deficits, solve the long-term imbalances built into our retirement and health care systems, and repair our educational system.\n\nSome will argue that we also need to protect ourselves from new sources of competition, like China and India and Vietnam, and the nations liberated from Soviet dominance by the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nToday, I am going to argue that that is precisely the wrong thing to do.

That exceeds the entire output of all but 15 other countries. Every year, we create the economic equivalent of a Sweden—or two Irelands, or three Argentinas. Year, after year, after year.\n\nNobody else has that heft.\n\nIn dollar terms, a growth rate of 3.5 percent in the U.S. is equivalent to growth surges of 16 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.K., 26 percent in China and 70 percent in India.\n\nOf course, our growth is driven by consumption, a significant portion of which is fed by imports, which totaled $2 trillion last year.

        "content": "February 6, 2006 London\n\nI am honored to be here today. The Fishers trace their roots to Surrey, our familial home until British authorities “encouraged” the more, shall we say, entrepreneurial side of the family to relocate to Australia. With the passing of time, we were welcomed back—to the Middle Common Room at Oxford’s Hertford College, where as a graduate student I met my wife and cemented a special affection for any and all things British.\n\nI have been asked to speak on the U.S. economy and will do so shortly. As you might expect from the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, I will dispense a little “Texas brag.” But no one who tills the fields of economics, not least a central banker, can stand in a British forum without a sense of humility and gratitude. You invented the “dismal science” that my Fed colleagues and I do our level best to put into constructive practice.\n\nSmith, Mill, Hume, Malthus, Ricardo, Keynes—even Marx—derived their economic theories on British soil, giving us principles and disciplines we have sought to perfect in the American economic machine. As you know, we Americans do love debt! And it is to the great economic intellects of England that we are most profoundly indebted.\n\nMy kind hosts, who had no idea that this event would follow so closely on the heels of the meager growth estimate reported for last year’s fourth quarter, have asked me to address the question: Is the United States still the growth engine for the world?\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nThe American economy has been on an upswing for more than four years. Growth advanced briskly at 4.2 percent in 2004. It slowed to a still solid 3.5 percent in 2005, although I would not be surprised if GDP were revised upward when we take a more definitive look at the fourth quarter. In January, the U.S. economy employed 134.6 million people, up 2.2 million in a year. Unemployment stood at a four-year low of 4.7 percent, which compares with the latest reading of 8.4 percent for Europe and even higher rates for some of the continent’s major economies.\n\nWe have weathered hurricanes’ fury and record-high energy prices while continuing to grow and keep inflation under control. The statement the Federal Open Market Committee released Tuesday quite summed up our current situation succinctly: “Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.”\n\nThis is especially true in what I call the “growth rim”—an arc of population centers with favorable demographics that begins in Virginia, runs down the southeastern seaboard through Georgia to Florida, then through the megastate of Texas and on to the uberstate of California and up to Seattle. I use “mega” and “uber” to describe the two largest states for a reason: to illustrate the depth and breadth of our economy. In dollar terms, Texas produces 20 percent more than India, and California produces roughly the same output as China. To the extent there is weakness in the U.S. economy, it is in the Northeast and North Central states.\n\nNetting all this out, the consensus of most economic forecasters is that growth in the first quarter will rebound to a rate well above 4 percent.\n\nTo understand what this kind of growth means, we need only follow Margaret Thatcher’s wise hectoring to “do the math.” The United States produces $12.6 trillion a year in goods and services. Be conservative—once again, Lady Thatcher would like it—and assume that in 2006 we grow at last year’s preliminary rate of 3.5 percent. The math tells us we would add $440 billion in incremental activity—in a single year.\n\nThat is a big number. What we add in new economic activity in a given year exceeds the entire output of all but 15 other countries. Every year, we create the economic equivalent of a Sweden—or two Irelands or three Argentinas. In dollar terms, a growth rate of 3.5 percent in the U.S. is equivalent to surges of 16 percent in Germany, 20 percent in the U.K., 26 percent in China and 70 percent in India.\n\nOf course, our growth is driven by consumption, a significant portion of which is fed by imports, which totaled $2 trillion last year. Again, do the math: Our annual import volume—what we buy in a single year from abroad—exceeds the GDP of all but four other countries—Japan, Germany, Britain and France.\n\nSo, yes, the United States is the growth engine for the world economy. And it is important that it remain so because no other country appears poised to pick up the torch if the U.S. economy stumbles or tires.\n\nAre there reasons to worry it might do so? In fashionable circles and at various “chat shows” like Davos, you certainly hear many.\n\nOf immediate concern is the potential bursting of the so-called housing bubble. Some parts of the United States have experienced uncommon acceleration of housing prices. We are all familiar with what occurred in the U.K., Australia and the Netherlands, where a deceleration of housing prices hit consumption hard. As a result, many a jaundiced eye is being cast on the U.S., where mortgage debt service as a percentage of disposable income has risen in recent years and consumption has been partly financed by equity aggressively “extracted” from the housing stock through ever more novel financial products.\n\nAgain, it is important to do the math.\n\nCurrently, 80 percent of U.S. homeowners have fixed-rate mortgages. Just one in five has a variable-rate mortgage. The majority of the latter are so-called hybrids, carrying a fixed rate for a few years before converting to a floating rate. Roughly 80 percent of these mortgages are scheduled to have their rates reset; however, the impact will not occur all at once but will be stretched out over the next several years.\n\nIt is true that homeowners with variable-rate loans borrow larger amounts. It is also true that they have higher incomes. The median borrower with a variable-rate mortgage devotes a smaller portion of household income to debt payments than those with fixed-rate loans.\n\nIn recent years, the analytically nettlesome Interest-Only—or IO—mortgages have become a significant percentage of housing loans in some markets. Unlike other mortgages, payments on IOs increase when the interest-only term expires and borrowers are required to make principal as well as interest payments. These mortgages pack a double whammy when rates reset after the IO period expires. Many of these mortgages, however, have long periods during which the interest rate and IO period are locked up. Given that the average mortgage is held only six or seven years, many houses will be sold or refinanced before the amortization period ever kicks in.\n\nGiven this, I will let you draw your own conclusions about whether the housing market’s financial dynamics will strain the U.S. economy as interest rates rise in response to Federal Reserve tightening. It is not unreasonable to think the situation is manageable, albeit worth watching closely. And this so-called cloud may even have a silver lining, as noted recently by Scott Burns, the astute American syndicated columnist. When people have to make money from their jobs, rather than from their homes, perhaps they will focus more on their work and what they produce. Not an altogether bad set of priorities!\n\nThe other preoccupation is the U.S. current account deficit, a subject second only in popularity to the ongoing saga of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. America’s large trade deficits have been discussed for so long by so many eminent analysts that I have little to add—except to remind you that it takes two to tango. Those urging the United States to rein in its spending should be equally full-throated in prodding countries with excess savings and trade surpluses to create conditions for growing their domestic demand. If they fail to do so, and the U.S. suddenly becomes virtuous on its own, the global economy would sink into a deep funk.\n\nSo if there is a ready substitute for the United States as the consumer of first and last resort for many developing economies, I would like someone to tell me which country, or group of countries, might fill the bill. As our new Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, made clear in a speech last April, this issue entails a lot of moving parts, but the counterpart to scant saving in the United States is excess savings by other countries and/or underinvestment in their own countries.\n\nI want to spend the remainder of my time at the podium talking about the long-run position of the United States. One of my favorite recollections from my days at Oxford is the story of John Maynard Keynes at the Bretton Woods conferences. He grew terrifically frustrated at the arrogance of the Americans and complained bitterly to Lord Halifax, the British ambassador. Halifax, who no doubt bore in mind the British legacy of intellectual thought that I cited earlier, sought to comfort him. Thus it was written:\n\nThe key to the American economy’s success in recent years—the wellspring of our growth— has been a unique combining of money and brains to enhance productivity, the ability to turn out more goods and services from our labor and other factors of production. This, I submit immodestly, we have done well. During the great post–World War II boom, productivity grew 2.7 percent a year from 1950 to 1973. It then slowed to an anemic 1.5 percent from 1974 to 1995, leading the denizens of Davos and other salons during the 1980s to extrapolate dark thoughts from then-fashionable titles like Ezra Vogel’s Japan as Number One, published in 1979, and Paul Kennedy’s The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, published in 1988. But just when it appeared Japan would pass America, we took a turn for the better. U.S. productivity ramped up to growth rates of 2.9 percent a year from 1996 to 1999 and 3.2 percent a year from 2000 to 2005.\n\nNew technology fed the productivity surge. The microprocessor led to a host of productivity-enhancing tools—increasingly miniaturized yet more powerful computers, cell phones, the Internet, bar-code scanners, fiber-optic cables—countless innovations that enhanced business managers’ ability to automate operations, rationalize inventories, enhance customer service, process data, move information and cut costs.\n\nThe Information Age technologies were available in nearly all countries, but few reaped the same productivity gains as the United States. Over the past decade, productivity growth in the European Union’s 15 core countries, for example, has averaged 1 percent a year, far less than the United States.\n\nThe key to wringing more from the new technologies lies in the American economy’s adaptability. We let the economy change. We provide a healthy environment to nurture entrepreneurs. Starting a business takes five days in the United States, compared with 45 days in Germany and 108 in Spain. We have not saddled the private sector with regulations that interfere with hiring and firing or dictate outmoded methods of production. We let labor, capital and companies compete—within the country and with the rest of the world. Our economy continually reorganizes itself to take advantage of new technologies, freeing labor from old jobs so it can move to new, higher-value uses.\n\nThe Lex Column in Friday’s Financial Times noted that Joseph Schumpeter called the capitalist process “creative destruction,” a marvelous phrase that captures the two-sided nature of economic progress. I like Schumpeter—despite the fact he never spent significant time in England—because his writings focus the mind on the process of change and adaptation. They are particularly relevant today. Listen carefully to these three quotes from two of his seminal works.\n\nIn his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, Schumpeter wrote: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.”\n\nFrom that same page: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory … illustrate the same process of industrial mutation … that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is … what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nAnd from volume 1 of Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: “A railroad through new country, i.e., country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nString the key phrases of those three citations together and you get the bottom-line plot of capitalism’s process of creative destruction: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic ... revolutionizes the economic structure, ... destroying the old one, . . . creating a new one .... [It] upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions, ... and hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nHere is where China and India and all the bristling new economic entrants come in. They are today’s equivalent of Schumpeter’s railroads. They and the phenomenon of globalization are agents of creative destruction writ large. From now on, hardly any way of doing things which used to be optimal will ever be the same.\n\nI posit that China and India and the new players will enhance American productivity and abet U.S. growth, not threaten it. These rising economies will provide sources of inputs American companies can use to drive down costs and increase variety for consumers. They will increase competition—which is good. Competition sharpens the wits and improves muscle tone. Facing foreign competition head-on will keep us at the forefront of the global economy by encouraging businesses to do what they should do: create jobs and profits in a virtuous cycle that, properly nurtured by monetary and fiscal policy, goes on indefinitely.\n\nNote that I mentioned monetary policy. I would like to think that America’s greatest asset is the wisdom and steady hand of its central bank. But truth be told, wise and temperate monetary policy is a necessary but insufficient condition for America’s success. Our greatest asset is our inherent flexibility and the private sector’s ability to capitalize on the ever-changing economic landscape. Our comparative advantage lies in the millions of managers in our business community who serve as the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching capitalism’s fingers into every corner of the world to extract value at the lowest cost—to enhance productivity. They adapt to economic change with breathtaking alacrity. I am not talking just about CEOs but also about middle managers who operate supply chains, control inventories and fine-tune operations. As long as the Federal Reserve does its job of holding inflation at bay, and as long as our political leaders resist protectionism and other forms of interference with creative destruction, we will remain a productive economic machine.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we refer to the process of creative destruction as “the churn.” I mentioned Ezra Vogel’s and Paul Kennedy’s works, which provide bookends of a sort for the 1980s. In preparing for this speech, I asked my staff to look at what has happened to the U.S. economy since that period, when it was fashionable to talk of America’s demise.\n\nTherein is the math of the churn.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2005, American workers filed 118 million claims for unemployment insurance. Many others lost their jobs, of course, but either didn’t qualify for benefits, were not unemployed long enough to file a claim, or quickly transitioned to new jobs. It is hard to find a figure that would include all the job losses, but it would be more than 150 million, surely. That is the destructive and painful side of the churn.\n\nYet, despite all these job losses:\n\nTotal employment over the period rose by 44 million—net. At annual rates, unemployment fell from 7.2 percent to today’s 4.7 percent. Productivity increased by 72 percent. Per capita real GDP shot up from $26,113 to $42,760. The average workweek fell by nearly two hours to 33.7 hours, and average household real net worth more than doubled to $431,000. That is the creative and restorative side of the churn. All this was accomplished, by the way, with less economic downtime. Since the beginning of 1982, the United States has had just 16 months of recession, compared with 43 in France, 70 in Germany and 82 in Japan.\n\nIn short, the churn works. If we allow the market system to recycle our labor to new, higher-value-added jobs, it will keep us working, productive, well paid and richer, with better jobs and more time to enjoy life.\n\nMervyn King was spot-on in his speech in Kent just three weeks ago when he noted that “a willingness to adapt and embrace, rather than resist, change is the key to greater prosperity. That road may at times be hard going...but it leads ultimately to a more prosperous destination.”\n\nP. G. Wodehouse, who wasn’t an economist or a central banker but who sprouted in British soil, would have put it this way: In a globalized, Shumpeterian world, it is simply not true that plus ça change results in the même chose. America’s business managers get it. The British business community gets it. Continental Europe’s private-sector managers are equally up to the task of adapting to compete. It is up to the continent’s political leaders to create conditions that liberate the private sector to reignite the combined mass of Europe’s economies as an engine of growth while the ECB ensures that business remains undistracted by inflation.\n\nUntil then, the task of being the world’s economic engine falls to the United States."

        "content": "January 19, 2006 Fort Worth, Texas\n\nThe views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nLong ago, the case for competition was articulated by such economists as Adam Smith and David Ricardo. At a private dinner last night, Chairman Greenspan reminded a group of us that Smith and Hume and Ricardo and Malthus and Keynes were all British, and it is to our British brethren that we owe our key understanding of economic principles. I would also draw on my own alma mater, the TCU of the East—Harvard—to credit one other economist for insights that put today’s world in perspective: a Czech educated in Vienna who taught at Harvard in the ’40s, Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter articulated the concept of “creative destruction.” Let me read you three excerpts from two of Schumpeter's seminal works.\n\nFirst, from Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy: “The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.”\n\nFrom that same page: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory…illustrate the same process of industrial mutation…that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of creative destruction is the essential fact of capitalism. It is…what every capitalist concern has got to live in.”\n\nAnd from volume 1 of Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: “A railroad through new country, i.e., a country not yet served by railroads, as soon as it gets into working order upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions within its radius of influence; and hardly any ‘ways of doing things’ which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nString the key operative phrases of those three citations together and you get the plot of this story, the plot of globalization: “The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic . . . revolutionizes the economic structure, . . . destroying the old one, . . . creating a new one. . . . [It] upsets all conditions of location, all cost calculations, all production functions, . . . and hardly any ways of doing things which have been optimal before remain so afterward.”\n\nThe master of creative destruction of syntax, Yogi Berra, put it more eloquently: Once you open new markets, “History just ain’t what it used to be.”\n\nGlobalization and the emergence of Chinese and Indian and other new competition is “creative destruction” writ large. We cannot hide from it. We can only rise to the occasion, channel it and adapt in order to benefit from it, rather than succumb to it.\n\nI submit to you that the country that took in my father and mother—the land that made me possible—is flexible and dynamic and bold enough to succeed and, indeed, prosper from what Steve Roach of Morgan Stanley calls “the heat of China’s emergence.” We will do so as long as the Federal Reserve does its job of ensuring the monetary backdrop for sustained non-inflationary economic growth and as long as our political leaders refrain from fiscal promiscuity or from false remedies such as protectionism. I will do my part to ensure the former. You must do yours to ensure the latter with those you elect to represent you.\n\nIt will be more difficult for the other developed economic powers of the world to cope with the “Chinese heat.” In my book, the recent German elections were about preventing a hollowing out of the German economy: Now Chancellor Merkel, a woman who understands instinctively the shortcomings of socialism, must lead Germany through a tectonic transformation. France’s old political elite have resisted adapting, but new political actors are grappling with it, and time will tell if the French have the wherewithal to survive as a linchpin of the European economy.\n\nItaly, the third European economic power, is also in need of radical transformation. At present, it is the English-speaking nations—England, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. (and, to give credit where credit is due, the Scandinavians and the Spaniards)—that are adapting best.\n\nWhich brings us to Japan and the current turmoil on the Japanese stock exchange and the issue of Livedoor and its CEO, Takafumi Horie.\n\nI met Horie-san in 2003, when, if memory serves, his company’s shares were trading at 12 yen. They rose to over 700 yen before their recent drop to 496. I have no idea if Horie-san’s accounting practices are valid or not. The reason I mention this matter is by way of illustrating adaptation.\n\nI lived in Tokyo in 1990 and ran my portfolio out of Nomura’s offices there while my oldest son played baseball in the Tokyo Junior Boys League. Perhaps because of that, when I was named deputy U.S. trade representative, I was appointed co-chairman, alongside the deputy foreign minister of Japan, of the Commission on Competition and Deregulation, a device thought up by President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto to bring about structural change in the Japanese economy. I served in that capacity for three years. Together, we engineered the initial restructuring of everything from the laws governing the size of retail stores to the electricity distribution system to the deregulation of telecommunications to the rules of corporate governance. The latter dealt with intricate details such as audit committee composition, the roles of directors and so on. I mention this to underscore only that I know enough about Japanese business practices and ethics so as to be dangerous!\n\nHere is the point: From my personal perspective, the thing to watch in Japan is not whether Mr. Horie is good or bad. Or whether Fujitsu or any other company gets a further contract to improve the capacity of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, as discussed in this morning’s Financial Times. The issue is how the Japanese deal with the situation and what their remedies tell us about their capacity to change and adapt a great and noble society that rose up from the ashes to become the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nThere is a dynamic tension in Japan today. Prime Minister Koizumi has taken on the old political dinosaurs. Young entrepreneurs gathered in the new office buildings in the Roppongi Hills area of Tokyo and elsewhere have challenged the tightly interwoven culture of the old Japanese corporate hierarchy. Foreign investment has positioned itself for a sea change in Japan’s direction.\n\nWe will learn a great deal about whether Japan has made the turn by how they handle Livedoor. If there is even a hint that the old order still has the power to stifle a “Roppongi Hills Tribe” entrepreneur because he dresses funny or is a college dropout or had the nerve to attempt to buy a baseball team or attempt a takeover of Nippon Broadcasting (assuming his tactics were legal and legitimate), then the Japanese authorities may well risk skepticism about their capacity to adapt to the demands of globalization and the creative destruction of the old order. If, on the other hand, they dispatch with the legitimate foibles of Horie or any other business operator in a manner that shows the rule of law, and practice, is geared to encouraging legitimate vehicles for creative destruction along Schumpeterian lines, then we will know that the Japanese are well on their way to joining us in handling “the heat of China's emergence.”"

        "content": "January 6, 2006 Boston, Massachusetts\n\nMany of my fellow Federal Reserve Bank presidents are economists by training and trade. I am not. My academic training culminated in an M.B.A. Before coming to the Dallas Fed, I made my living as an investor in globally diversified equities and distressed debt, and after beating the house for 20 years, I figured I was pressing my luck and cashed in to become a U.S. trade negotiator. I do not mind admitting to some apprehension about speaking to an audience of economists on an economic topic. But I am very comfortable with a subject I consider one of the biggest challenges my colleagues and I must cope with: globalization’s impact on the gearing of the economy and the making of monetary policy.\n\nThe literature on globalization is large. The literature on monetary policy is vast. But the literature examining the combination of the two is surprisingly small.\n\nA search for scholarly articles with the words “globalization” and “monetary” and “policy” turns up 31,500 references. Narrowing your quest to the exact word combination “globalization and monetary policy” produces only 39 citations. Limiting the word combination to the title of an article, you will find just two articles.\n\nTom Friedman’s popular book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century doesn’t have a single entry on “money,” “monetary policy” or “central banking.” The word “globalization” does not appear in the index of Michael Woodford’s influential Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy. Nor do the words “international trade” or “international finance.”\n\nWhat gives? Is the process of globalization disconnected from monetary policy? Is central banking totally divorced from globalization?\n\nI think not. I believe globalization and monetary policy are intertwined in a complex narrative that is only beginning to unfold.\n\nLet me tell you of one eye-opening experience. About two years ago, I was in London on business for Kissinger McLarty, where I worked after the U.S. Trade Representative’s office and before joining the Fed. I received a call from the head of Japan’s equivalent of the Business Roundtable, the Keidanren, asking me to pop over to give a couple of speeches. They made an offer I couldn’t refuse, and I said I would be happy to travel to Tokyo if they could schedule the flights. They booked me on Virgin Air and arranged for a car to take me to Heathrow.\n\nAt the appointed time, the car didn’t show up. So I called the number I had been given, and on the other end was a woman with a frightfully British accent. When I asked, “Could you kindly tell me where my car is, ma’am?” she deftly shifted to a Southwestern American accent and said, “Now don’t you worry. It is five minutes away. Ah apologize for the delay. Have a nice flight.”\n\nI said, “Well, hold on a minute. You answered this call in a British accent but once I spoke, you shifted to a Texas accent. Who are you? Where are you?”\n\n“Well,” she answered, “I am a call center operator in Bangalore.”\n\n“Have you ever been to the United States?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, no, sir. But I can tell that you are from Arkansas, Texas or New Mexico.”\n\n“And how do you learn to speak like me?”\n\n“Well, sir, for people like you, we watch a television show called Walker, Texas Ranger.”\n\n“And what if I were from Boston?”\n\n“Ah, for those people we watch Cheers.”\n\nIt may seem a small matter that a Japanese firm employed a worker in India to track a car by GPS in London and mimic a voice from Texas. But globalization impacts the conduct of business so much more profoundly. The expansion of our productive capacity, the pricing mechanism of labor and other inputs, the relationship between inventories and sales—all are being changed by the global spread of capitalism.\n\nWhere does monetary policy come into play in this world?\n\nOne of the first books I read as I prepared for my new job as Dallas Fed president was A Term at the Fed, an excellent little tome written by former Federal Reserve Governor Larry Meyer. It gives you a good sense of the lexicon of monetary policy deliberations. The language of Fedspeak is full of sacrosanct terms such as “output gap” and “capacity constraints” and “the natural rate of unemployment,” known by its successor acronym, “NAIRU,” the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\n\nAll of this jargon reflects the fact that central bankers do not wish to strain the economy’s capacity to produce. They want GDP to run at no more than its theoretical limit, for exceeding that limit for long might stoke the fires of inflation. One key capacity factor, for example, is the labor pool. The shibboleth known as the Phillips curve posited that beyond a certain point too much employment would ignite demands for greater pay, with eventual inflationary consequences for the entire economy. The econometric calculations behind the Phillips curve and the panoply of other domestic “capacity constraints” and “output gaps” were based on assumptions of a world that in my opinion exists no more.\n\nMeyer’s book is a real eye-opener because it describes in great detail the learning process of the FOMC members as the U.S. economy morphed into the new economic environment of the second half of the 1990s. At the time, economic growth was strong and accelerating. The unemployment rate was low, approaching levels unseen since the 1960s. The prevailing views of the Phillips curve, capacity constraints, output gaps and the NAIRU pointed to rising inflation. That is precisely what the Federal Reserve’s models were saying, as was Meyer himself, joined by nearly all the other Fed governors and presidents gathered around the FOMC table. Under the circumstances, they concluded that monetary policy needed to be tightened to head off the inevitable.\n\nThey were frustrated by Chairman Greenspan’s insistence on postponing rate hikes, yet perplexed that inflation wasn’t rising. Indeed, it kept falling.\n\nIf the conventional wisdom had prevailed, the Fed would have caused the economy to seriously underperform. According to back-of-the-envelope calculations by economists whom I respect, real GDP would have been lower by several hundred billion dollars. Employment gains would have been reduced by perhaps a million jobs. The costs of not getting these critical calibrations right would have been huge.\n\nHow was Greenspan able to get it right when other very smart men and women did not? Well, we now see with 20/20 hindsight what Greenspan instinctively saw early on—the fact that accelerating productivity had begun to alter the traditional relationships among economic variables.\n\nGreenspan understood the data and the modeling techniques of the Fed’s research staff and other outstanding economists. But he was also constantly talking—and listening—to business leaders. And what they were telling him jibed with what he knew from years of consulting and sitting on corporate boards: They were simply doing their job of seeking any and all means of earning a return for their shareholders. At the time, they were being enabled by new technologies that enhanced productivity. The Information Age had begun rewriting their operations manuals, creating a schism between the efficacy of prevailing theory and real-world practice.\n\nIt is important to listen to our economy’s business operators. We have millions of experienced managers and decisionmakers in the private sector. This may be our greatest competitive advantage, the wellspring for the mighty economic machine that produces some $12 trillion in economic output. Our business managers are the nerve endings in Adam Smith’s invisible hand, stretching the fingers of capitalism into every corner of comparative advantage worldwide. America’s business managers have begun taking advantage of globalization, just as they had previously reaped the gains from inventing new technology and then using it.\n\nConsider labor alone. In the early ’90s, the former Soviet Union released millions of hungry workers into the system. China joined the World Trade Organization at the turn of the century, and 750 million workers came into play. And now India, with more than 100 million English-speaking workers among its 1 billion people, has joined the game. What does all this mean to American managers paid to enhance returns to shareholders by growing revenues at the lowest possible costs? Because labor accounts for, on average, about two-thirds of the cost of producing most goods and services, the managers will go where labor is cheapest. They will have a widget made in China or Vietnam, or a software program written in Russia or Estonia, or a center for processing calls or managing a back office set up in India or the Philippines.\n\nThe destruction of communism and the creation of vast new sources of inputs and production have upset all the calculations and equations of the very best economics minds. How can economists quantify with precision what the United States can produce with existing labor and capital when we do not know the full extent and elasticity of the global labor pool? Or the totality of the financial and intellectual capital that can be drawn on to produce a nation’s GDP? How do we measure the inventory-to-sales ratio in a technologically advanced, hyper-interconnected world where offshore sources are expanding geometrically, if not exponentially?\n\nAs long as we are able to hold back the devil of protectionism and keep open international capital markets and remain an open economy, how can we calculate an “output gap” without knowing the present capacity of, say, the Chinese and Indian economies? How can we fashion a Phillips curve without imputing the behavioral patterns of foreign labor pools? How can we formulate regression analyses to capture what competition from all these new sources does to incentivize American management?\n\nThe old models simply no longer apply in our globalized, interconnected and expanded economy. This is why I think so many economists have been so baffled by the length and strength of the current expansion and the non-inflationary prosperity we have enjoyed over the past almost two decades.\n\nYou could sense something was wrong with the econometric equations if you listened to the troops on the ground, fighting in the trenches of the marketplace. That is what my colleagues and I at the USTR did negotiating market-opening trade rounds with China, Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil and others in the late 1990s. It is what my colleagues and I at Kissinger McLarty did while advising dozens of U.S. companies seeking entry into China, the former Soviet satellites, India and Latin America. It is what my colleagues and I on the FOMC do by making dozens upon dozens of calls every month to CEOs, COOs and CFOs of businesses, large and small. We see managers at work expanding the capacity of our economy, expanding the gap between what their previously limited resources would allow them to produce and what their newly expanded globalized, technologically enhanced reach now allows them to produce.\n\nFrom this, I conclude that the economics profession needs to rejigger its econometric equations to better inform our understanding of the maximum sustainable levels of U.S. production and growth.\n\nYes, Globalization Matters\nThere are, of course, those who will argue, at least from a theoretical perspective, that globalization should not matter much in a world of flexible exchange rates. They contend that a central bank can tailor monetary policy to domestic objectives alone when it is not obliged to defend a specific value for the currency.\n\nThis proposition, which goes back to John Maynard Keynes, has been taught in economics classes for 50 years or more. Indeed, it was the basis for much of the theoretical economics I was taught as a Harvard undergraduate 37 years ago. The proposition, however, holds only under assumptions I do not think apply in the world we live in today. The theory, for example, requires that capital be completely mobile, equalizing interest rates around the world, and that domestic prices be free from distortions, regulation, trade barriers and the like.\n\nCapital is indeed more mobile than it was 40 years ago, but not completely so. Economies are still far from free of government meddling that distorts the market’s price-setting function. You need look no further than the European Union’s agricultural policies. The greater the distortion, the higher the inflation. As excess regulations and barriers are eliminated, the central bank's incentives will change and inflation will fall. Kenneth Rogoff made this argument a couple of years ago to explain how globalization has been largely responsible for the worldwide decline in inflation over the past 10 to 15 years.\n\nAs good economists, you might protest that liberalized trade policies, the impact of new economic entrants and the like are one-time shocks, unlikely to produce a sustained decline in inflation. In the real world, though, these changes take time to work themselves through the economy. An analogy is the deregulation of banks and airlines in the late 1970s, both supposedly one-off events. Who would argue that these companies aren’t still adjusting to these “one-time shocks”? When I helped negotiate China into the World Trade Organization, a process that was not completed until the start of the Bush “43” administration, I knew my yet-to-be-born grandchildren would be dealing with the tail end of the changes wrought by China’s entry into the global marketplace.\n\nGlobalization still has a long way to go. It will prompt a long-term sequence of changes in the United States and around the world. Its impact has a half-life of at least a dozen years—if I can borrow a term from nuclear physics, a subject about which I know even less than I know about theoretical economics.\n\nTo be sure, not everyone buys into my proposition about how globalization impacts worldwide inflation. Even so, as a practical matter, globalization has important implications for monetary policymakers, flexible exchange rates or no. We actually ponder the depths and resilience of Chinese capacity, for example, when we sit around the table of the FOMC. Our understanding of how the economy operates depends on the behavior of economic actors and forces that are new and different in a world of increasing globalization.\n\nIt is a world of intense competition, and that creates incentives to raise productivity as well as the means to do so. In the past decade, the U.S. economy’s average annual increase in output per hour has been 2.7 percent, just about equal to the extraordinary quarter-century boom that followed World War II. My business contacts talk and act as if the globalization now under way will bring another decade of hypercompetition. This global hothouse will enable, perhaps even force, businesses to keep productivity growth in the range we have enjoyed since the mid-1990s, hopefully for many years to come. If productivity growth can stay near 3 percent, monetary policy can accommodate relatively faster growth without igniting inflation.\n\nI like to say money is the economy’s lifeblood. The Federal Reserve’s great responsibility is to maintain the cardiovascular system of American capitalism. The Fed’s operations—from processing payments to regulating banks to trading foreign exchange to setting the federal funds rate—keep open the arteries, veins and capillaries of capitalism. A healthy cardiovascular system enables the brain and propels the muscles of production. The quality of the money supply is critical to economic success, as is the quantity.\n\nYou cannot have the dynamic progress Tom Friedman describes in his book without the well-functioning, reliable monetary regimes central banks have been sustaining. It is an especially intense responsibility for the Federal Reserve, as the primus inter pares central bank, serving the largest economy in the world and circulating the world’s most utilized currency. One cannot make monetary policy at the Federal Reserve without being cognizant of the forces of globalization acting upon our economy. Nor can one be oblivious to the need to conduct our policy with an awareness of how our actions impact markets and, therefore, economic potential worldwide.\n\nKeeping inflation in check is a central bank’s sacred mission. By spurring productivity and fomenting tectonic economic changes, globalization has acted as a tailwind for the Fed’s—and other central banks’—efforts to hold down inflation. I believe the Federal Reserve has been able to contain inflation with faster growth than would have been possible in the absence of globalization. In short, globalization has made the Fed’s job easier over the past few years.\n\nWill the tailwinds stay with us?\n\nLeft to their own devices, I think they would remain for a significant time, but we have to take into account the political dimension. I have expressed my concern about the implications of our fiscal deficits, vowing never to use my vote on the FOMC to monetize excess spending. I have also warned of the dangers of protectionism, which would undercut globalization’s favorable impact on inflation. Deficits and protectionism could lead to interest rates higher than they would otherwise need to be in order to maintain low inflation.\n\nAs a Texan, I am mindful of the story about William McChesney Martin, Fed chairman from 1951 to 1970. President Johnson invited him down to his Texas ranch for what turned out to be a one-on-one meeting. The president wanted a more accommodating monetary policy, and Martin, a strong advocate of Fed independence, tried to explain to him the consequences of that course of action. Johnson would have none of it and advanced on Martin, shoving him around the room and shouting, “Boys dying in Vietnam, and Bill Martin doesn’t care!” Years later, Martin expressed his regrets about shifting policy to suit the president. “To my everlasting shame,” he said, “I finally gave in to him.”[1]\n\nPresidents Clinton and Bush have allowed the Fed to operate with a high degree of political independence from the administration. On the whole, Congress has also wisely refrained from interference. Without its independence from political interference, I doubt the Fed could have so successfully set the interest rates that have led to today’s favorable economic circumstances. Just as I doubt that, without independence from rigid econometric dicta, monetary policy could have so adroitly harnessed, and in turn lubricated, the forces of globalization."
