        "content": "November 30, 2016 New York City\n\nThank you for having me here today at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nI spent 23 years working on Wall Street. Much of my business career and many of my nonprofit activities have been based in this city. Many of my closest friends and mentors live in New York, and some are in attendance this morning. So I am very glad to be visiting with you here today.\n\nAs most of you know, I have been president and CEO of the Dallas Fed since September 2015. In this role, I have now participated in 10 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and am firmly ensconced in performing the key duties of a Federal Reserve Bank president. In that regard, I have spent a substantial amount of time getting to know business and community leaders throughout the Eleventh District and have developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the Board of Governors.\n\nThe Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. We represent the Eleventh District, which is composed of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nAs you probably also know, Texas now accounts for 8.7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).[1] It is the largest exporting state in the U.S. and is home to 52 Fortune 500 companies. The characteristics of our district help give the Dallas Fed excellent insight into energy, trade, immigration and other key aspects of the regional, national and global economies.\n\nToday, I would like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. After that, I will look forward to taking your questions.\n\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin my remarks by talking about energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District as well as the United States. As you know, energy prices have substantially declined since June of 2014. In early 2014, the mining sector, composed substantially of oil and gas exploration and services, accounted for approximately 2.8 percent of U.S. GDP. By early 2016, the sector had declined to approximately 1.3 percent of GDP.[2]\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by sometime in the first half of 2017. This balancing process could be accelerated if there is a more explicit agreement worked out between OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) nations to limit production levels.\n\nWhile there are varying estimates of the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on the expectation that global oil supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and at a similar rate in 2017.\n\nThis balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated. While average daily U.S. oil production has declined by as much as 1 million barrels over the past year, this decline has been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and excess inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2017 and 2018, we expect to see continued price volatility. However, as the market moves toward balance, we expect to see excess inventories stabilize and then begin to decline, and prices continue to firm. Despite this firming, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings and merger activity in the energy sector in the U.S. While rig count has increased over the past few months, based on our energy surveys and discussions with market participants, we believe that rig count is unlikely to increase significantly in the U.S. until prices rise to between $55 and $65 per barrel.\n\nA weak energy sector and a stronger dollar have created headwinds for our district. The rate of job growth in Texas for the first half of 2016 was just below 1 percent. We saw continuing job losses in energy as well as weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector and slowing growth in its service sector. However, as the headwinds from energy begin to subside, we are starting to experience faster growth. In this regard, we now expect to see approximately 2 percent job growth in the second half of 2016 and a similar rate of growth in 2017.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from the migration of people and firms to the state. The population in Texas stood at approximately 27.5 million in 2015 versus 22.8 million in 2005.[3] As a result of an increasingly diversified economy as well as continued migration of people and firms to the state, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the months and years ahead.\n\nU.S. GDP growth in the first half of 2016 was a disappointing 1.1 percent.[4] Underpinning this weak growth was the financial turmoil in the first quarter of this year as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. Estimates of third-quarter GDP growth now show an improvement to 3.2 percent. Based on these estimates and our confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer, we now expect full-year 2016 GDP growth of approximately 2 percent.\n\nThis is sluggish growth by historical standards but should still be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate and remove slack from the labor market. In assessing labor slack, we look at the headline rate of unemployment of 4.9 percent, but we also track the participation rate, estimates of the number of people working part time for economic reasons and other measures of labor market utilization. The participation rate stands at 62.8 percent versus 66 percent in 2007.[5] Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that much of this decline is due to changes in demographics—that is, workers are aging out of the labor force. This trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as almost all advanced economies. For example, within the next 10 years, we expect the participation rate to fall below 61 percent if no mitigating actions are taken.[6] Without a material improvement in the rate of U.S. productivity growth, this trend is likely to have significant negative implications for future potential GDP growth.\n\nRegarding inflation, our Dallas Fed economists track headline inflation and other measures of core inflation, including the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. It has been running consistently at 1.7 percent since the start of 2016, up from 1.6 percent in 2015. The stability and trend of this measure gives us confidence that the headline inflation rate should gradually reach the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target in the medium term. Progress in reaching this objective has been frustratingly slow over the past few years.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team is closely monitoring economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of Brexit on the U.K. and European economies as well as monitoring the risk of contagion. At this stage, I believe that the impact of Brexit is likely to be very manageable for the U.S.\n\nOur Dallas Fed research team is also monitoring emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high and growing levels of debt, and is in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. We think this transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower rates of Chinese growth. This deceleration, coupled with high levels of debt, is likely to create currency volatility and make global markets more vulnerable to periodic bouts of turmoil—which could have the potential to tighten global financial conditions.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring key cyclical trends in the economy, I also closely monitor more persistent secular drivers, which help explain shorter-term economic results. I am particularly focused on four key drivers:\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a mandate to pursue full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment objective, as I just discussed, I believe we are making good progress toward reaching our goal. I do believe that, in a more interconnected world, labor slack should be assessed in a global context. Excess capacity outside the U.S. may be dampening inflation pressures in the U.S. As a result, I think we may still have some capacity for further job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce.\n\nIn terms of price stability, even though headline inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective, I believe that, as the impacts of lower energy prices and a stronger dollar begin to dissipate and as the labor market continues to tighten, headline inflation will likely trend toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term.\n\nIn light of the challenges posed by the broad secular drivers I discussed earlier, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done gradually and patiently. I am cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policy tools are asymmetrical at or near the zero lower bound—that is, it is easier to tighten policy than to ease policy at this point in the normalization process.\n\nLastly, I have repeatedly stated that I believe it is important that we strive to take steps to “normalize” monetary policy because there is a cost to excessive accommodation in terms of penalizing savers, as well as creating potential distortions and imbalances in asset allocation, investing, hiring and other business decisions. These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nBased on these considerations, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual mandate, I would advocate that we take action to remove some amounts of accommodation.\n\nLet me now turn to a discussion of the appropriate role of monetary policy.\n\nThe Role of Monetary Policy\n\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. It is worth noting that the last time short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s as the U.S. struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. While policy rates are historically low, real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are also at historically low levels across a wide swath of countries, including the United States.\n\nA major driver of these historically low rates is the decline in expectations for future economic growth. As I have discussed, key persistent trends—particularly aging-workforce demographics, as well as weak productivity growth—are having a negative impact on growth prospects in the U.S. as well as in most other advanced economies. An additional likely reason for the persistence of low interest rates is the emergence of the U.S. as a chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly financially interconnected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—which means that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries.\n\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower levels of productivity growth, high levels of debt to GDP, as well as the dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of technology-enabled economic disruption. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that could address more fundamental economic challenges.\n\nFor the past eight years, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on structural reforms and fiscal policy. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular challenges, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nPotential Policy Actions Beyond Monetary Policy\n\nGiven that aging-workforce demographics are expected to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. Appropriate immigration policy is likely to be a key element of this effort. Historically, immigration has played an important role in economic growth in the U.S. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have comprised more than half of the growth in the labor force in the U.S. over the past two decades.[8]\n\nPolicies that involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment are likely to be critical in order to ensure that an increasing percentage of our population can become more productive members of the workforce. Options for improving educational attainment could include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skill-based opportunities of the 21st century. These programs could help to grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by numerous companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and help bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create increased incentives for growth and investment, which might ultimately improve future rates of GDP growth. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down global interest rates, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending and the formation and growth of small businesses. This may help explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\n\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening Social Security and Medicare without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability and ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force while helping to soften the impact of aging-workforce demographic trends on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of future government debt burdens (as a percentage of GDP), might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade reforms, which could create a more level global playing field for the movement of goods and services. Policymakers would need to address which of these options might make sense to pursue—but my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the fundamental challenges we currently face.\n\nClosing\n\nMonetary policy is a key element of economic policy—but it shouldn’t be the only element of policy. To improve future economic outcomes for our citizens, we need to consider structural and fiscal policies alongside sound monetary policy.\n\nIt has been a pleasure speaking with you today. I would now be happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."

        "content": "November 4, 2016Mexico City\n\nThank you for having me here today at the Asociación de Bancos de Mexico.\n\nMexico is a very important partner to the United States, and there is a long history of close relations between the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Banco de México as well as with the broader leadership of Mexico. In particular, I would like to thank Agustín Carstens for his warm hospitality and outstanding efforts to build a strong relationship with the Dallas Fed over the past several years.\n\nAs most of you know, the Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in the United States. We represent the Eleventh District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. This territory includes 74 percent of the 1,933 miles that comprise the U.S.–Mexico border.\n\nAs you probably also know, Texas is the largest exporting state in the U.S., and Mexico is our number one trading partner.[1] A majority of Texas immigrants come from Mexico.[2] In addition, cross-border investment is a key element of economic development in our region. So, building our relationship is critically important—which is why I am very glad to be here today and why I look forward to working with you for many years to come.\n\nToday, I would like to talk briefly about the close ties between Mexico and the United States. I would then like to discuss my assessment of economic conditions as well as the appropriate role of monetary policy in addressing key economic challenges we face. Then, I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nThe Mexico–U.S. Relationship\n\nSince the implementation of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), trade between the U.S. and Mexico has grown from approximately $159 billion in 1994 to over $532 billion in 2015. According to U.S. government estimates, approximately 45 percent of this represents U.S. exports to Mexico, and the remaining 55 percent represents imports from Mexico to the U.S.[3] Approximately 81 percent of Mexico’s exports in 2015 went to the U.S.[4]\n\nIncreased bilateral trade and production sharing between the U.S. and Mexico has resulted in stronger economic integration, rising foreign direct investment and increasing business-cycle synchronization. For example, estimates indicate that approximately 40 percent of content in U.S. imports from Mexico originates in the U.S.[5]\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mexico is the number one destination for Texas exports. In 2015, Texas exported approximately $92.5 billion of goods to Mexico.[6] Dallas Fed research indicates that trading collaboration with Mexico has materially improved Texas’ global competitiveness.[7]\n\nToday, many Texas border cities benefit from increased U.S.–Mexico economic integration. Roberto Coronado is head of the El Paso branch of the Dallas Fed and has done extensive work trying to better understand this economic integration. His research suggests that growth in manufacturing activity in northern Mexico has generated substantial job growth in border cities such as El Paso and McAllen.[8] Job gains have been concentrated in services and transportation, resulting in better wages and improved standards of living for Texas border residents.[9]\n\nThe U.S. is home to more immigrants from Mexico than from any other nation—approximately 12 million. Mexican-born immigrants account for 27 percent of all immigrants living in the U.S. and 55 percent of immigrants living in Texas.[10] Immigration has contributed substantially to labor force growth in the U.S. and Texas. It is estimated that immigrants and their children have comprised more than half of the growth in the labor force in the U.S. over the past two decades.[11] In Texas, foreign workers overall are estimated to have comprised over 40 percent of workforce growth between 1990 and 2010.[12]\n\nPia Orrenius leads our effort to understand immigration as well as broader economic conditions in the Eleventh District. Dallas Fed research indicates that highly skilled immigrants are substantially beneficial to the U.S. economy.[13] Related research suggests that these workers tend to patent at much higher rates than similarly educated natives, hence contributing disproportionately to innovation and productivity growth.[14] Further, immigrants tend to be more entrepreneurial than natives and have somewhat higher rates of self-employment.[15] Pia’s research suggests that, on average, Mexican immigrant education levels are rising, and increasing numbers are filling high-skilled jobs in the U.S.[16]\n\nOne further insight from Pia’s work is the fact that Mexico–U.S. migration has slowed since the Great Recession.[17] Net immigration flows between the two countries have been running close to zero over the past several years. This slowdown appears to have been driven primarily by improving economic conditions in Mexico relative to the U.S. In addition, the increase in dual-earner households, smaller average family size, the creation of a more substantial social safety net, as well as stronger domestic labor market prospects in Mexico have all worked to reduce the flow of migration to the U.S.\n\nI look forward to talking more about these subjects in the Q and A. But now, let me turn to a discussion of economic conditions in the Eleventh District as well as the U.S.\n\nDiscussion of Economic Conditions\n\nLet me begin my remarks by talking about energy, given its importance to the Eleventh District and Mexico as well as the United States. As you know, energy prices have substantially declined since June of 2014. This weakness has certainly created economic headwinds for Mexico as well as the Eleventh District economy.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we continue to believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by sometime in the first half of 2017. This balancing process could be helped if there is a more explicit agreement worked out between OPEC nations to limit production levels.\n\nWhile there are varying estimates of the timing of reaching balance, we believe that the overall trend is the key—we are moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on our expectation that global supply will grow at a slower rate and that daily demand will continue to grow, on average, at approximately 1.3 million barrels per day for the remainder of 2016 and in 2017.\n\nThis balancing process has been more painful and slower than some had anticipated. While average daily U.S. oil production has declined by as much as 1 million barrels over the past year, these declines have been more than offset by production increases in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia and other countries. As a result of these developments, global oil supply reductions have been slow to materialize, and excess inventories of oil products now stand at record-high levels.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2017 and 2018, we expect to see continued price volatility. However, as we move toward balance, we expect to see excess inventories begin to decline and prices continue to firm. Despite this firming, we expect to see more bankruptcies, restructurings and merger activity in the energy sector in the U.S. Based on our energy surveys and discussions with market participants, the rig count is unlikely to increase significantly in the U.S. until prices rise to between $55 and $65 per barrel.\n\nThe energy sector as well as a stronger dollar have created headwinds for our district. The rate of job growth in Texas for the first half of 2016 was just below 1 percent. We saw continuing job losses in energy as well as weakness in the state’s manufacturing sector and slowing growth in its service sector. However, as the headwinds from energy and the dollar have begun to subside, we are beginning to see faster growth. In this regard, we now expect to see approximately 2 percent job growth in the second half of 2016 as well as in 2017.\n\nTexas continues to benefit from migration of people and firms to the state. Population in Texas stood at approximately 27.5 million in 2015 versus 22.8 million in 2005.[18] We expect this trend to continue in 2017 and beyond.\n\nGDP growth in the first half of 2016 was a disappointing 1.1 percent.[19] Underpinning this weak growth was the financial turmoil in the first quarter of this year as well as a sizable inventory deceleration in the second quarter. Initial estimates of third quarter GDP growth show an improvement to 2.9 percent. Based on these estimates and our confidence in the strength of the U.S. consumer, we now expect full-year 2016 GDP growth of approximately 2 percent.\n\nThe October employment report showed a headline unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. Additionally, the October labor force participation rate stood at 62.8 percent versus 66 percent in 2007.[20] We at the Dallas Fed believe that much of this decline is due to changes in demographics—that is, workers are aging out of the labor force. This trend is expected to continue in the U.S. as well as almost all advanced economies. For example, within the next 10 years, we expect the participation rate to fall below 61 percent if no mitigating actions are taken. This trend has significant implications for potential GDP growth.\n\nRegarding inflation, our Dallas Fed economists track headline inflation and other measures of core inflation including the Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate. This measure trims out outlying price movements. It has been running consistently at 1.7 percent since the start of 2016, up from 1.6 percent in 2015. The stability and trend of this measure gives us confidence that the headline inflation rate should gradually reach our 2 percent target in the medium term. Progress in reaching this objective has been frustratingly slow over the last few years.\n\nIn assessing economic conditions in the U.S., my research team is closely monitoring economic developments outside the U.S. to assess how these developments might impact economic growth domestically. In this regard, we are closely watching the impact of BREXIT on the U.K and European economies as well as monitoring the risk of contagion. At this stage, I believe that the impact of BREXIT is likely to be very manageable for the U.S.\n\nOur Dallas Fed research team is also monitoring emerging-market countries, particularly China. China has a high degree of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high and growing levels of debt, and is in the midst of a multiyear transition from being a manufacturing- and export-driven economy to one that is based on consumer spending and services. We think this transition is likely to take many years, and the world is going to have to become accustomed to lower levels of Chinese growth. This deceleration coupled with high levels of debt is likely to make financial markets more vulnerable to periodic bouts of financial turmoil, which have the potential to tighten global financial conditions.\n\nBroader Secular Trends\n\nIn addition to monitoring key cyclical trends in the economy, I am also closely monitoring more persistent secular drivers, which help explain shorter-term economic results. I am particularly focused on four key drivers:\n\nThe Role of U.S. Monetary Policy and the Need for Structural Reforms and Broader Economic Policy\n\nThese secular trends are having an impact on economic conditions. They are, to a great extent, structural—that is, they are not easily addressed through monetary policy. This is one reason why I have suggested that, at this stage of the economic recovery, we need fiscal policy and structural reforms to join the menu of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that address deeper fundamental challenges.\n\nFor example, given an aging population, we need to explore policies that could grow the workforce in the years ahead. This would likely involve greater emphasis on improving levels of educational attainment so as to raise the productivity of the U.S. workforce.\n\nOptions for improving educational attainment levels must include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skills-based opportunities of the 21st century. These programs could help grow the workforce and address the skills gap that has been identified by many companies we speak with in the Eleventh District.\n\nI also believe it makes sense to consider a range of public investments that upgrade aging infrastructure and could potentially improve productivity and help to bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies could be considered in order to create greater incentives for capacity expansion and capital investment, which might ultimately improve future rates of GDP growth. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down global interest rates, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending, and the formation and growth of small business. This may help explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\n\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening Social Security and Medicare without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability as well as ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force, while helping to soften the impact of aging demographic trends on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of future government debt burdens (as a percentage of GDP), might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade reforms, which could help create a more level global playing field for the movement of goods and services.\n\nMonetary policy is a key element of economic policy—but it shouldn’t be the only element of policy. To improve future economic outcomes for our citizens, we need to consider structural and fiscal policies alongside sound monetary policy.\n\nClosing\n\nIt has been a pleasure speaking with you today. I look forward to working with you in the years ahead to build the relationship between our two countries.\n\nNow, I would be happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."

        "content": "August 2, 2016 Beijing\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you. I have been coming to China regularly for the past 25 years. I’ve always enjoyed working with Chinese companies and getting to know leaders in this country. So, it’s a real pleasure for me to be here today.\n\nAs you know, I have been president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since the beginning of September 2015. The Dallas Fed is one of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Reserve System. It has approximately 1,200 employees and oversees the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nAs head of the Dallas Fed, I participate in every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is the key monetary policy making body within the Federal Reserve System.\n\nToday, I’d like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. I will also discuss some of the key challenges facing policy makers in the years ahead.\n\nI’d like to start my remarks with a brief discussion of some of the larger secular issues that I see forming the broader context for our work.\n\nGlobalization\n\nThe world has become much more interconnected over the past several decades. Major companies have increasingly spread their operations throughout the world in order to serve customers and improve their competitiveness. As a result of this, S&P 500 companies now derive as much as 50 percent of their earnings from outside the United States.[1] While corporate revenue and profit growth have been enhanced by globalization, this trend has clearly created strains on cities and towns that have seen jobs and significant portions of key industries relocate to other geographic regions.\n\nAs global trade between countries has expanded, economic conditions in one nation now have a greater potential to impact economic conditions in other nations. These impacts are generally transmitted through the trade of goods and services as well as through capital flows and labor market dynamics.\n\nWhile economies are more globally connected, financial markets have also become much more interconnected. Investment portfolios are increasingly global, and asset allocators increasingly think internationally when making investment decisions. Because financial markets trade in real time, market strains or other challenges in one market now have the potential to rapidly affect currency, debt and equity markets globally.\n\nWe certainly saw the effects of this interconnectedness during the 2008–09 financial crisis. More recently, and on a much smaller scale, we saw how turmoil in currencies and local markets in certain countries in early 2016 helped lead to global market volatility and a rapid tightening of overall financial conditions. We are also seeing this trend in continuing increases in global investment demand for “safe” assets—particularly U.S. government securities.\n\nDemographics\n\nA second major challenge is demographics. The United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the issue of aging populations. These demographic changes will bear directly on the rates of workforce participation and, in turn, impact rates of potential economic growth across the industrialized world.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024.[2] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise steadily through 2060.\n\nAs you know, in China, the size of the working-age population peaked in 2014 as fertility rates have declined below the population replacement rate. The median age in China has increased from 22 in 1980 to 37 today and is estimated to be 50 by 2050. The Chinese working-age population as a share of total population is estimated to have peaked at 74 percent in 2011 and, based on current trends, is expected to fall to 59 percent by 2050.[3] This decline will create headwinds for the country’s future economic growth.\n\nHigh Levels of Debt to GDP\n\nWhile these demographic trends continue to unfold, it is also the case that the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) has increased in Japan, China and the U.K. as well as most major countries in Europe. In the U.S., for example, household balance sheets have improved since the financial crisis, but business debt to GDP is somewhat higher and government debt to GDP has also increased.\n\nWhile U.S. government debt held by the public is approximately 75 percent of GDP [4], it is estimated that the present value of unfunded “entitlements” is now in excess of $45 trillion.[5] These unfunded obligations will increasingly work their way into the annual budget deficit over the next five to 10 years and will tend to increase the U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.\n\nChina has also seen a significant increase in its debt levels. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Chinese nonfinancial debt to GDP was estimated at 255 percent (as compared to 148 percent at the end of 2008). This was composed of government debt of 44 percent, household debt of 40 percent and private nonfinancial debt of 171 percent.[6] This debt growth may prove to be unsustainable.\n\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption\n\nWhile these larger forces are unfolding, the rate of disruption in industry is increasing. More than ever before, consumers are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and services. New business models are emerging which offer products and services in a superior manner to older models. Amazon or Alibaba versus a retail store is a classic example.\n\nThese trends are encouraging companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower costs, improve productivity and enhance customer service. While the impacts can be hard to measure, I believe these changes are reducing the pricing power of companies and putting some degree of downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services. This, in turn, is affecting the way companies think about traditional capital spending and overall resource allocation.\n\nIt is difficult to fully determine the ultimate impacts of these secular trends on economic growth, labor market dynamics and price stability. However, I do believe that these underlying forces are likely to have a significant impact on economic conditions in the years ahead. These forces will also have significant implications for monetary as well as fiscal policy. As the world has become more complex, central bankers must work to better understand these issues in order to make sound judgments regarding monetary policy.\n\nWith this backdrop, let me turn to a discussion of the economic conditions in the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, the United States and the world. I will then talk about their implications for monetary policy.\n\nI’ll start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh District as well as its importance to the U.S. and the world.\n\nBased on analysis as well as discussions with industry contacts, our Dallas Fed economists believe that global oil production and consumption should move into rough balance by the first half of 2017. While there are varying estimates of the precise timing of this balancing process, the key to us is the trend—we are gradually moving toward balance. Our analysis is based on our expectation that global demand for oil will grow by approximately 1.3 million barrels per day, on average, in 2016.\n\nDespite significant cuts in capital spending and rig counts in the U.S., global supply reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. As supply reductions in the U.S. have occurred, they have been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Russia and other nations.\n\nOver the past few months, market prices have likely been impacted by periodic supply disruptions, such as those which have occurred in Canada, Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait. We believe that the bulk of these supply outages have now been restored.\n\nWe expect continued price volatility as we head into year-end. In addition, because many U.S. energy companies are highly leveraged or operate in areas where the breakeven cost of production is above current market prices, we expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry during the remainder of 2016.\n\nThe challenges of the energy industry continue to create headwinds for our district. The oil and gas industry now accounts for approximately 2 percent of Texas employment [7] and 6 percent of its GDP [8] (versus 3 percent of employment and 13 percent of GDP in 2014).\n\nTexas has substantially diversified its economy over the past three decades and has also become the top exporting state in the U.S. Texas has benefited from a sustained migration of people and firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation by almost a full 1 percentage point per year. This growth and diversification has helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite recent headwinds from lower energy prices and the negative impact on exports from a strong dollar.\n\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of 0.5 percent, compared with 1.3 percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2014.[9] Manufacturing in Texas remains weak, and some of this weakness has spread to the state’s service sector. Jobs declined across most sectors and regions in the first quarter when oil prices fell sharply and exports were weakened by a stronger dollar. However, in the second quarter, job growth rebounded and leading indicators improved in the state.\n\nAs the headwinds from energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead. My optimism is due particularly to the increasingly diversified nature of the Texas economy as well as the continued migration of people and firms to the state.\n\nGross Domestic Product and Employment\n\nEstimates of first and second quarter 2016 GDP growth in the U.S. have been disappointing. Despite this, Dallas Fed economists continue to expect that GDP will grow approximately 2 percent in 2016, based largely on our expectation of solid consumer demand.\n\nWhile the most recent revision of the May jobs report showed a net increase of only 11,000 jobs, the June report showed an increase of approximately 287,000 jobs.[10] The three-month average pace of growth was 147,000 jobs. This deceleration from last year’s 200,000-plus pace should not be unexpected as the economy has moved closer to full employment.\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which measures the population 16 and older that is either employed or actively looking for work, stands at 62.7 percent. The unemployment rate is now 4.9 percent, after five years of steady declines.[11]\n\nThe labor force participation rate is now 3.3 percentage points below its prerecession level. Dallas Fed economists believe that most of this decline is due to an aging population. It is our view that if current trends continue, the participation rate is likely to decline to below 61 percent by 2024.[12] This expected decline will have negative implications for future potential GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nHeadline inflation continues to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. The most recent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) report indicated headline inflation of 0.9 on a 12-month basis, up from 0.3 percent one year ago.[13]\n\nIn addition to headline inflation, our economists carefully track measures of core inflation. In particular, we look at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean inflation rate, which trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price changes. This rate had been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent on a yearly basis from early 2014 until the end of 2015. Since the start of 2016, it has edged up to roughly 1.8 percent. The stability and trend of this measure bolsters our confidence that headline inflation will reach 2 percent over the medium term as the effects of declining energy prices and a stronger dollar ultimately subside.\n\nWhile we are the central bank of the United States, it is critical to assess how global economic conditions impact domestic economic conditions. Estimates of global growth continue to be revised downward, and the composition of this growth continues to be uneven.\n\nBrazil, Russia and Venezuela are expected to remain in recession in 2016, while advanced economies are expected to show only modest growth. In addition, as you know, China continues to be challenged by overcapacity in key industries, high levels of debt to GDP and aging demographics as well as managing an initiative to transition from an export- and manufacturing-based economy to one that is more consumer and service-sector based. As China grapples with these issues, its future rates of GDP growth are likely to decline. As the world adjusts to these lower levels of growth, we will continue to carefully monitor the potential spillover effects on currencies as well as global financial conditions.\n\nWe will also continue to monitor and assess the implications of Brexit in the United Kingdom. While this decision has had some ripple effects on global financial markets (particularly regarding currencies and interest rates), it will take time for events to unfold before we know the ultimate impact of this decision on growth in the U.K., Europe and the rest of the world.\n\nI am closely monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity and high levels of debt to GDP in major economies outside the U.S. might be impacting economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely tracking how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner, based on a realistic assessment of progress toward achieving the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives regarding full employment and price stability. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the zero lower bound.\n\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve raised the range by 25 basis points in December 2015 after seven years at the zero lower bound. Prolonged low rates, several rounds of quantitative easing and other extraordinary Fed policy actions came in response to the severe financial crisis and economic recession of 2008 and 2009.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last time short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s as the U.S. economy struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. In addition, government bond yields in Germany and Japan are actually negative, even at maturities over five years.[14] Real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are at or below zero across a wide swath of countries, including the United States. This situation has been accentuated in the aftermath of Brexit.\n\nAs central bankers, we aim for monetary policy to be accommodative when the economy is operating below full employment and trend inflation is below target. We typically begin to remove accommodation as we move closer to achieving those dual goals. When our full-employment and price-stability goals are in conflict, the FOMC makes an assessment of the “balance of risks” to the two objectives.\n\nWhile there are disagreements about how much slack remains in the labor market and about how best to gauge trend inflation, policy debates focus more fundamentally on how to gauge the appropriate level of tightness or accommodation in monetary policy. This, in turn, depends on judgments about the “neutral rate”—the rate that signifies the dividing line between an accommodative and a restrictive monetary policy. This debate is complicated by the fact that the neutral rate is “unobserved”—that is, we have to infer this rate based on observations of financial and economic data.\n\nEconomists and other forecasters have lowered their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate over the past several years. Yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have also signaled a decline in the longer-run neutral real rate.[15]\n\nA major driver of the decline in the neutral rate is a decrease in estimates of future growth. Longer-run estimates of future GDP growth have been declining across most advanced economies. This growth slowdown has been mostly due to demographics, but weaker productivity growth also contributes significantly to this decline.\n\nAnother likely reason for the decline in the neutral rate is the emergence of the U.S. as chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly interconnected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—meaning that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries. Robert Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institution argues that the representation of risk-averse foreign investors in U.S. financial markets has increased and that this trend has contributed to downward pressure on the neutral real rate.[16]\n\nMy colleague John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, along with Thomas Laubach, on the staff of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has estimated that, as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, the longer-run real neutral rate was approximately 0.2 percent.\n\nEvan Koenig and Alan Armen at the Dallas Fed estimate of the shorter-run real neutral rate was negative 1 percent as of the end of the second quarter of 2016. By this measure, the Fed was only modestly accommodative last quarter.\n\nWhile there are different approaches to measuring the neutral rate, it is clear that there has been a significant decline in estimates of the neutral rate over the past several years.\n\nI am strongly persuaded by arguments that aging demographics in advanced economies, slower productivity growth and the continued emergence of the U.S. as a source of safe assets have all contributed to the decline in the neutral rate. I also believe that high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies and higher levels of political polarization have, at a minimum, limited the capacity of these countries to implement fiscal policy and structural reforms that could have stimulated higher rates of growth. This situation has, in turn, caused the neutral rate to be lower than it would be otherwise.\n\nIn light of the decline in the neutral rate, using monetary policy to help manage the economy has become more challenging.\n\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower rates of productivity growth and high levels of debt to GDP as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of economic disruption.\n\nFor the past eight years, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on fiscal policy or structural reforms. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular issues, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nIn the U.S., given that aging of the population is expected to continue to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to examine policies that would ensure an inflow of workers to strengthen and grow the U.S. workforce. Appropriate immigration policy is a key element of this effort.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could help to bolster sluggish demand in the near term while boosting productivity in the long run. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies that create incentives for growth and investment could ultimately improve growth rates. Improved growth expectations could help counter the forces holding down the neutral real interest rate, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nHistorically during economic downturns, fiscal policy has often been used to assist monetary policy. However, due to high levels of debt to GDP as well as political polarization, governments have had difficulty coming to consensus on such action.\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions that could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including comprehensive regulatory review at the national, state and local levels, as well efforts to implement more comprehensive trade policy. Policy makers would need to address which of these might make sense to pursue. Whichever choices these leaders prefer, my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the challenges we currently face.\n\nI believe advanced economies around the world are at the stage where structural reforms, fiscal policy and other government actions need to join the menu of economic policy. That is, to address several of the key challenges we face, there needs to be economic policy action beyond monetary policy. While there may be good reasons why monetary policy has been the primary policy action over the past several years, we are now at the point where policy makers must enter a new phase in our thinking and actions.\n\nWe need to think more expansively about how to generate higher rates of sustained GDP growth. Now, eight years after the Great Recession, we need to take a new and broader approach to our economic policy making.\n\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nNotes\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."

        "content": "June 23, 2016 New York\n\nThank you for inviting me to speak with you.\n\nI want to talk with you today about monetary policy—its proper role, how it’s currently positioned, and the challenges facing policy makers in the years ahead.\n\nLet me begin with a brief discussion of current economic conditions and the implications for monetary policy. I will then talk a bit about key issues facing economic policy makers.\n\nI’ll start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh Federal Reserve District as well as its importance to the nation and the world.\n\nBased on analysis as well as discussions with industry contacts, our Dallas Fed economists believe that global oil production and consumption will get into rough balance by early 2017. While there are varying estimates of the precise timing of this balancing process, the key to us is the trend—we are gradually moving toward balance. Our forecast is based on our expectation that global demand will grow by approximately 1.3 million barrels per day in 2016 as compared to 2015.[1]\n\nDespite significant cuts in capital spending and rig counts in the U.S., global supply reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. As supply reductions in the U.S. have occurred, they have been more than offset by production increases in Iran, Russia and other nations.\n\nBased on a slowing rate of global supply growth (including significant supply cuts underway in the U.S.) as well as steady growth in demand, we expect excess oil inventories in OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries to begin to decline in the near future. Inventory drawdowns will also be impacted by periodic supply disruptions, such as those which have occurred in Canada, Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait.\n\nAs a result of these trends, we would expect oil prices to continue to firm in the coming months. Even with prices firming, because many energy companies are highly leveraged or operate in areas where the breakeven cost of production is above current market prices, we expect to see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry during the remainder of 2016.\n\n(Note: Next week the Dallas Fed will release the results of its new quarterly energy survey. The survey samples nearly 200 upstream energy companies headquartered in the Eleventh District, many with national and global operations. Respondents will report on their expectations for oil and gas prices, production levels, cost information, employment, capital spending and the overall outlook.)\n\nThe Eleventh District is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. The challenges of the energy industry continue to create headwinds for our district. The industry now comprises approximately 2 percent of Texas employment[2] and 7 percent of its gross domestic product [3] (versus 3 percent of employment and 13 percent of GDP in 2014).\n\nTexas has substantially diversified its economy over the past three decades. Some of this diversification has occurred organically, and a significant portion has developed as a result of a sustained migration of people and firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation by a full 1 percentage point per year. This growth and diversification has helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite recent headwinds from lower energy prices and a strong dollar.\n\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect Texas job growth of 1.3 percent—the same as in 2015, but down from 3.7 percent in 2014.[4] Manufacturing in Texas remains weak, but the state’s service sector continues to show steady growth. While Houston and other energy-sensitive cities continue to face economic headwinds, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin are growing at healthy rates.\n\nDue to an increasingly diversified economy as well as continued migration of people and firms to Texas, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead—particularly as the headwinds from energy and a strong dollar continue to dissipate.\n\nGross Domestic Product and Employment\n\nEstimates of first quarter 2016 GDP growth were disappointing. In addition, the recently released May jobs report showed a net increase of only 38,000 jobs.[5]\n\nThe labor force participation rate, which measures the population 16 and older that is either employed or actively looking for work, declined from approximately 62.8 percent to 62.6 percent.[6] While the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent,[7] the decline was driven primarily by the reduction in the participation rate.\n\nDespite this most recent information, Dallas Fed economists continue to expect that GDP will grow approximately 2 percent in 2016. This forecast is based on our expectation of strong consumer demand in the U.S.\n\nAt this stage in the economic cycle, it is our updated view that job growth of between 60,000 to 120,000 per month will be necessary to keep the unemployment rate constant, depending on changes in the labor force participation rate.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is now 3.4 percentage points below its prerecession level. Dallas Fed economists believe that most of this decline is due to an aging population. It is our view that if current trends continue, the participation rate is likely to decline to below 61 percent by 2024.[8] This expected decline will have negative implications for future potential GDP growth in the U.S.\n\nInflation\n\nHeadline inflation continues to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. The most recent PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) report indicated headline inflation of 1.1 percent on a 12-month basis.[9]\n\nIn addition to headline inflation, our economists carefully track measures of core inflation. In particular, we look at the Dallas Fed Trimmed Mean inflation rate, which trims out the most extreme upward and downward monthly price changes. This rate had been running between 1.6 and 1.7 percent from early 2014 until the end of 2015. Since the start of this year, it has edged up to between 1.8 and 1.9 percent. The stability and trend of this measure bolsters our confidence that headline inflation will reach 2 percent over the medium term as the effects of declining energy prices and a stronger dollar ultimately subside.\n\nWhile we are the central bank of the United States, it is critical to assess how global economic conditions impact domestic economic conditions. Estimates of non-U.S. growth continue to be revised downward, and the composition of this growth continues to be uneven.\n\nBrazil, Russia and Venezuela remain in recession in 2016 while advanced economies show modest but steady growth. One particular concern is China, which continues to be challenged by overcapacity in key industries, high levels of debt to GDP, aging demographics as well as an initiative to transition its economy from one that is heavily export and manufacturing based to one that is more consumer and service-sector based.\n\nAs China grapples with these issues, its future rates of GDP growth are likely to decline. As the world adjusts to these lower levels of growth, China may be vulnerable to periodic bouts of currency and financial turmoil, which have the potential to trigger a tightening of conditions across global financial markets. We saw this unfold in January and February when the devaluation of the Chinese currency was accompanied by a steep selloff in Chinese markets, which then transmitted to a tightening in global financial conditions. We will continue to carefully monitor this situation as it unfolds over the next several years.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left policy unchanged at our recent June meeting.\n\nIn the coming weeks, I will be carefully assessing incoming economic data in order to gauge our progress towards achieving our dual mandate objectives regarding full employment and price stability.\n\nI am closely monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity and high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies outside the U.S. might be impacting economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely tracking how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done in a gradual and patient manner, based on a realistic assessment of economic conditions. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk management point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the zero lower bound.\n\nWith that overview, let me turn to a broader discussion of the role of monetary policy.\n\nAs you know, the target range for the federal funds rate stands at 25 to 50 basis points. The Federal Reserve raised the range by 25 basis points in December 2015 after seven years at the zero lower bound. Prolonged low rates, several rounds of quantitative easing and other extraordinary Fed policy actions came in response to the severe financial crisis and economic recession of 2008 and 2009.\n\nIt is worth noting that the last time that short-term interest rates in the United States were this low was during the middle and late 1930s, as the U.S. economy struggled to emerge from the Great Depression. Policy rates in other countries are also at historically low levels. Nominal rates in Japan, Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden are actually negative, as are government bond yields in Germany and Japan, even at maturities over five years.[10] Real government bond yields—returns after inflation—are at or below zero across a wide swath of countries, including the United States.\n\nReal and nominal yields at these low levels raise concerns for the economic outlook and for monetary policy. Low real returns challenge those trying to accumulate assets for retirement or those who rely on income from their investments. Low nominal yields can be a sign that monetary policy is struggling to maintain long-run price stability—or they can be a sign that central banks are pursuing highly accommodative policies. High levels of accommodation have the potential to distort asset-allocation decisions and the hiring and investment decisions made by businesses. The stakes are high: History has shown that real and financial market imbalances, once they accumulate, typically are painful to unwind. The difficulty is that these imbalances often aren’t obvious until after the fact.\n\nWhy are short-term interest rates so low? What can be done to stimulate growth and create an environment that is conducive to normalizing the level of interest rates in the United States? What should be the role of monetary policy, as well as other government actions, in this effort?\n\nTo address these questions, let me start with a discussion of the neutral real interest rate.\n\nAs central bankers, we aim for monetary policy to be accommodative when the economy is operating below full employment and trend inflation is below target. We typically begin to remove accommodation as we move closer to achieving those dual goals. When our full-employment and price-stability goals are in conflict, the FOMC makes an assessment of the “balance of risks” to the two objectives.\n\nWhile there are disagreements about how much slack remains in the labor market and about how best to gauge trend inflation, policy debates focus more fundamentally on how to gauge the appropriate level of tightness or easiness in monetary policy. This, in turn, depends on judgments about the “neutral rate”—the rate that signifies the dividing line between an accommodative and a restrictive monetary policy. This debate is complicated by the fact that the neutral rate is “unobserved”—that is, we infer this rate based on observations of financial and economic data.\n\nIn January 2012, Federal Reserve policy makers submitted their projections of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate over the medium term. Since that date, the median projection of these policymakers has declined from a 4.25 percent longer-run nominal funds rate to 3.0 percent in the most recent June submission. Given the FOMC’s commitment to a 2.0 percent longer-run inflation target, these projections imply a reduction in the longer-run neutral real interest rate from 2.25 percent to 1.0 percent today. Trading levels of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have signaled a substantially similar decline in the longer-run neutral real rate.[11]\n\nA major driver of the decline in the neutral rate is a decrease in estimates of future growth. In the first quarter of 2003, the Congressional Budget Office projected five-year prospective growth would average 3.25[12] percent per year; in the first quarter of 2008, the prospective five-year growth estimate was 2.88[13] percent per year, and today, prospective five-year growth is estimated to be 2.28[14] percent per year.\n\nThis growth slowdown has been mostly due to demographics—baby boomers are moving into their retirement years—but weaker productivity growth also contributes significantly to this decline. Given the deterioration in U.S. growth prospects, it makes sense that the longer-run neutral real interest rate has declined. This deterioration appears to be occurring across all advanced economies, which helps explain the historically low level of rates we are seeing.\n\nAnother likely reason for the decline in the neutral rate is the emergence of the U.S. as chief supplier of safe assets to the world. In an increasingly globally connected world, the search for safety and return occurs globally—meaning that low rates in one country can quickly impact interest rates in other countries. Robert Hall of Stanford University and the Hoover Institution argues that the representation of risk-averse foreign investors in U.S. financial markets has increased and that this trend has contributed to downward pressure on the neutral real rate.[15]\n\nMy colleague John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, along with Thomas Laubach, on the staff of the Board of Governors, has done pioneering work on the neutral rate (r*) that argues the longer-run neutral real rate depends on the economy’s potential growth rate, which varies over time, as well as other unobserved factors.[16] As of the first quarter of 2016, the Laubach–Williams model implied a 0.2 percent neutral real rate.\n\nEvan Koenig and Alan Armen at the Dallas Fed use movements in slack to help identify the neutral real rate. They focus on shorter-run r* and, rather than make r* a direct function of growth in potential output, Koenig and Armen draw on signals from the financial markets and changes in household wealth. They argue that wealth growth and long-term yields do a good job of picking up changes in growth prospects and capture movements in other r* determinants.[17]\n\nThe Koenig–Armen model says that the short-run neutral real rate was negative 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2016, about 1.5 percentage points below the latest Laubach–Williams estimate of the longer-run rate and only 15 basis points above the actual real rate. Policy was only modestly accommodative last quarter, according to Koenig–Armen.\n\nWhile these approaches yield different estimates of the neutral real rate, they each indicate that there has been a significant decline over the past several years.\n\nI am strongly persuaded by arguments that aging demographics in advanced economies, a decline in productivity growth and the continued emergence of the U.S. as a source of safe assets have all contributed to the decline in the neutral rate. I also believe that high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies and higher levels of political polarization have, at a minimum, limited the capacity of these countries to use fiscal policy and structural reforms that could have stimulated higher rates of growth. This situation has, in turn, caused the neutral rate to be lower than it would be otherwise.\n\nIn light of the decline in the neutral rate, using monetary policy to help manage the economy has become more challenging. One of the implications of very low short-term rates is that there is less room for monetary policy makers to use these rates to increase the level of accommodation in situations where it is deemed advisable. This has led central banks around the world to try other, more “unconventional” policies to create greater accommodation. Examples include quantitative easing in various forms as well as negative interest rates.\n\nMonetary policy has a key role to play in economic policy. However, at or near the zero lower bound, it may be less effective than other tools of economic policy. Monetary policy is not designed, by itself, to address the key structural issues we face today stemming from demographic changes, lower levels of productivity growth and high levels of debt to GDP as well as dislocations created by globalization and increasing rates of economic disruption. While monetary policy certainly has a key role to play, it is not a substitute for actions that address structural issues and other economic challenges.\n\nFor the past eight years, advanced economies have relied heavily on monetary policy and much less on fiscal policy as well as other structural reforms. However, at this stage, if we are going to generate higher sustainable rates of GDP growth and address key secular issues, there needs to be policy action beyond monetary policy. This action could take a variety of forms.\n\nGiven that aging of the population is expected to continue to create headwinds for future economic growth, more could be done to examine policies that could ensure an inflow of workers to strengthen and grow the U.S. workforce. Appropriate immigration policy is a key element of this effort.\n\nInvestment in education is also a key element of ensuring that our population achieves sufficiently high levels of educational attainment so they can become productive members of the labor force. Many have argued that improving educational attainment is critical to raising workforce productivity in the U.S., thereby improving economic growth. Options for improving educational attainment must include beefing up public/private partnerships that focus on vocational training that equips workers for technical and other skills-based opportunities of the 21st century.\n\nPublic investments that upgrade aging infrastructure could potentially improve productivity and help to bolster sluggish demand. Given the sizable private pools of capital that exist today, some meaningful portion of this investment could come from public/private partnerships, with substantial capital coming from the private sector.\n\nMore broadly, tax reform and regulatory policies that create incentives for growth and investment could ultimately improve growth rates. Improved growth expectations could help to counter the forces holding down the neutral real interest rate, giving monetary policy makers greater scope for action without resorting to unconventional tools.\n\nSome observers suggest conducting a comprehensive review of regulations at the national, state and local levels. They argue that, in some cases, excessive regulation and fees might be creating undue burdens on capital investment, lending, and the formation and growth of small business. This may help to explain why business investment and small-business formation have been disappointing over the past several years.\n\nAccording to government estimates, the present value of future underfunding of “entitlements” is in excess of $45 trillion.[18] This underfunding is expected to increase annual U.S. budget deficits, as a percent of GDP, into the foreseeable future. Some have suggested that this level of underfunding may create growth in federal debt burdens that is unsustainable.\n\nEntitlement reforms, which involve strengthening these programs without jeopardizing potential benefits for those already 55 or older, could help improve the sustainability as well as ease the future fiscal burden of these programs. In addition, reforms might reduce current disincentives to remain in the labor force, while helping to soften the demographic transition’s depressing effects on growth and interest rates. Such reforms, insofar as they ease long-term concerns regarding the sustainability of debt to GDP, might also reduce uncertainty about future tax rates and boost growth expectations through that channel.\n\nHistorically during economic downturns, fiscal policy has often been used to assist monetary policy. However, due to high levels of debt to GDP as well as political polarization, governments have had difficulty coming to consensus on such action.[19]\n\nThese are some examples of policy actions which could be considered. There are certainly other examples, including efforts to implement more comprehensive trade policy. Policy makers would need to address which of these might make sense to pursue. Whichever choices policy makers prefer, my point is that some of these actions will be necessary to address the challenges we currently face.\n\nI am optimistic about the strength of the U.S. economy and the future of this nation. However, this optimism is based on a belief that we as a nation will address pressing secular as well as shorter-term cyclical challenges. Our ability to face key issues and come together to address them has been an essential element of the enduring strength and success of our great country.\n\nI believe our country is at the stage where structural reforms, fiscal policy and other government actions need to join the menu of economic policy. That is, to address several of the key challenges we face, there needs to be economic policy action beyond monetary policy. While there may be good reasons why monetary policy has been the primary policy action over the past several years, we are now at the point where policy makers must enter a new phase in our thinking and actions.\n\nWe need to think more expansively about how to generate higher rates of GDP growth. Now, eight years after the Great Recession, we need to take a new and broader approach to our economic policy making.\n\nThank you. I look forward to taking your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."

        "content": "April 29, 2016 Dallas\n\nI want to thank the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum for inviting me here today. I have worked extensively with British and European companies over the past 25 years, so I am very pleased to be able to talk with you today.\n\nI have been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since the beginning of September. The Dallas Fed has approximately 1,200 employees and oversees the Eleventh District, which is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States. It was legally established by Congress in 1913 and is charged with the mission of ensuring the stability and flexibility of the nation’s monetary and financial systems. It is responsible for monetary policy, regulation and supervision of banking institutions, and providing certain financial services to banks and the U.S. federal government (which includes playing a key role in the nation’s payment system). It is comprised of a Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., as well as 12 regional banks distributed across the United States. Each region is numbered and referred to as a “district.”\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the key monetary policymaking body within the Federal Reserve System. It holds eight scheduled meetings a year to assess economic conditions in the U.S. and decide on the stance of monetary policy. FOMC participants include all members of the Board of Governors as well as the 12 regional Bank presidents. The governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and a rotating group of four other regional Bank presidents vote on policy at each FOMC meeting.\n\nThe Fed has been structured to be independent within the federal government, and the chair of the Board of Governors provides regular reports to Congress on the economy and monetary policy. Most central banks globally have been set up in a similar manner, with independence (that is, insulation from short-term political pressure) as a key feature of their operating models.\n\nSince joining the Fed, I have participated in six FOMC meetings. I have also spent a substantial amount of time getting to know business and community leaders throughout the Eleventh District and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the Board of Governors.\n\nI have so far been very impressed with the dedication and commitment to excellence of my Fed colleagues in the Eleventh District and across the nation. I have also learned that the Fed benefits greatly from a diversity of views and a process which seeks out insight from members of the private sector, community leaders and other citizens. I have been impressed with the substantial amount of time volunteered by business leaders and nonprofit leaders in monthly board meetings, economic surveys and one-on-one meetings which inform and supplement our analysis of economic conditions.\n\nToday, I’d like to speak with you about my assessment of economic conditions as well as my views regarding monetary policy. I’d like to start my remarks with a brief discussion of some of the larger secular issues that I see forming the broader context for our work.\n\nThe Broader Context\n\nI came to the Fed because I believe that, as challenging as the past eight years have been, the next period of time is likely to be just as complex. While the U.S. and the world have made good progress in recovering from the economic crisis, we still face a number of significant challenges. Many of these issues arise from longer-term secular forces that have been taking shape over the past several years and are likely to exert even greater influence in the future.\n\nGlobalization\nThe world has become much more interconnected over the past several decades. Major companies have become more global and have increasingly spread their operations throughout the world in order to serve customers and improve their competiveness. This geographic expansion has improved flexibility in sourcing and producing in order to manage logistics and lower costs.\n\nCompanies increasingly think about their labor, products and services with a global mindset. By and large, corporate revenue and profit growth have been enhanced by globalization even though this trend has clearly created strains on cities and towns which have seen jobs and industries relocate to other geographic regions. As evidence of this trend, S&P 500 companies now derive as much as 50 percent of their earnings from operations outside the United States.[1]\n\nAs global trade between countries has expanded, economic conditions in one nation now have a greater potential to impact economic conditions in other nations. These impacts are generally transmitted through the trade of goods and services as well as through impacts on labor market dynamics.\n\nWhile economies are more globally connected, financial markets have also become much more interconnected. Investment portfolios are increasingly global, and asset allocators increasingly think globally in making investment decisions. Because financial markets trade in real time, market strains or other challenges in one market now have the potential to rapidly affect currency, debt and equity markets globally.\n\nWe certainly saw the effects of this interconnectedness during the financial crisis of 2008–09. More recently, and on a much smaller scale, we saw how turmoil in currencies and local markets in certain countries in early 2016 helped lead to global market volatility and a rapid tightening of overall financial conditions.\n\nDemographics\nA second major challenge is demographics. The United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the issue of aging populations. For example, in the U.S. as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024.[2] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise steadily through 2060.\n\nIn the Euro area, we estimate that the working-age population, as a percentage of the total population, has been declining since 1990. Further, we estimate that the absolute size of the working-age population likely peaked in 2010 at approximately 219 million and has since declined in absolute terms and will continue to decline in the coming decades.[3] In the United Kingdom, we expect the working-age population will continue to grow, although at a somewhat slower pace than growth in the total population.\n\nThese demographic trends bear directly on the rates of workforce participation and, in turn, impact rates of potential economic growth in advanced economies. For example, based on current demographic trends, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the labor participation rate in the U.S. will decline 2 percentage points to approximately 61 percent by 2024.[4] Assuming no mitigating actions are taken, this will likely have some negative impact on potential GDP (gross domestic product) growth rates in the future.\n\nHigh Levels of Debt to GDP\nWhile these demographic trends continue to unfold, it is also the case that levels of debt to GDP have increased in advanced economies. In the U.S., for example, household balance sheets have improved since the crisis but business debt to GDP is somewhat higher and government debt to GDP has also increased.\n\nWhile the U.S. government debt held by the public is approximately 75 percent of GDP,[5] it is estimated that the present value of underfunded “entitlements” is now in excess of $40 trillion.[6] These underfunded obligations will increasingly work their way into the annual budget deficit over the next five to 10 years and will help to increase the U.S. budget deficit as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe demographic trends I just described are likely to put increasing strains on the ability of advanced economies to meet these growing obligations. In light of these demographics, there is some question as to whether these U.S. budget trends will prove to be unsustainable and whether similar strains will be felt in Japan, China and the U.K. as well as most major countries in Europe.\n\nIn addition, the rising future burden of entitlements, coupled with a higher degree of political polarization in certain countries, has likely impaired the capacity for fiscal policy actions, which could have potentially contributed to economic recoveries around the world. This, in turn, has put substantial focus on the role of monetary policy to address important economic challenges. While monetary policy has a key role to play in this regard, it was never designed nor intended to act in isolation; fiscal policy as well as other governmental actions must also play key roles.\n\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption\n\nWhile these larger forces are unfolding, the rate of disruption in industry is increasing. Consumers increasingly are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and services. New business models are emerging which offer products and services in a superior manner to older models. Amazon versus a retail store is a classic example.\n\nThese trends are encouraging companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower costs, improve productivity and enhance customer service. While the impacts can be hard to measure, I believe these changes are reducing the pricing power of companies and putting some degree of downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services. This, in turn, is affecting the way companies think about traditional capital spending and overall resource allocation.\n\nIt is difficult to fully determine the ultimate impacts of these secular trends on economic growth, labor market dynamics and price stability. However, I do believe that these underlying forces are likely to have a significant impact on economic conditions in the years ahead. These forces will also have significant implications for monetary as well as fiscal policy. As the world has become more complex, central bankers must work to better understand these issues in order to make sound judgments regarding monetary policy.\n\nWith this backdrop, let me turn to a discussion of economic conditions in the Eleventh District, the United States and the world. I will then briefly discuss the implications of these conditions for U.S. monetary policy.\n\nEleventh District Discussion of Energy\n\nI’ll start with a discussion of energy because of its impact on the Eleventh District as well as its importance to the nation and the world.\n\nAs we sit here today, Dallas Fed economists estimate that global daily oil production exceeds daily consumption by more than 1 million barrels per day.[7] It is our current expectation that global oil supply and demand will get into some degree of daily balance by early 2017. This current estimate assumes that non-OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) production will decline significantly during the latter half of this year. This estimate is also underpinned by our forecast that global demand will grow by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day in 2016.[8] Lastly, this forecast assumes that supply disruptions, such as those that have occurred in Nigeria, Iraq and Kuwait, are ultimately resolved, with production being restored.\n\nIt is worth noting that, despite very significant cuts in capital spending in the U.S., supply reductions have been slow to materialize over the past year. When supply reductions have occurred in non-OPEC nations, they have been more than offset by production increases from Iran, Russia and other nations.\n\nAs a result of this recent prolonged period of oversupply, excess inventories in the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) member countries now stand at approximately 440 million barrels.[9] This is a record level of excess inventory and has raised concerns about whether there is sufficient storage capacity in certain geographic areas.\n\nWe believe that market participants have taken some comfort—potentially too much comfort—from discussions of a potential production freeze by OPEC members as well as Russia. We have consistently believed that any such negotiations would be unlikely to lead to actual production declines, and that Iran intends to increase its production until its output reaches pre-sanction levels.\n\nWith these various crosscurrents, we expect 2016 to be a year of continued price volatility as production estimates continue to fluctuate and forecasts regarding the timing of supply/demand balance continue to be adjusted. We also expect to see a continuing high level of restructurings, bankruptcies and (where possible) mergers in the energy industry.\n\nEleventh District Overall Economic Conditions\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the Eleventh District of the Federal Reserve is comprised of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico. While energy is an important part of this region, its share of GDP has declined over the past two years. In particular, the energy industry is now approximately 2 percent of Texas employment[10] and 9 percent of GDP[11] (versus 3 percent of employment and 14 percent of GDP in 2014).\n\nTexas has substantially diversified its economy over the past 25 years. Some of this diversification has occurred organically, and a significant portion has developed as a result of a sustained migration of people and firms to the state. Since 2000, population growth in Texas has exceeded that of the nation by a full 1 percentage point a year. This growth and diversification have helped contribute to the resiliency of the state despite headwinds from energy as well as a strong dollar.\n\nIn 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect job growth between 0.5 and 1 percent, as compared with 1.3 percent in 2015 and 3.7 percent in 2014.[12] Manufacturing remains weak, but the state’s service sector continues to show steady growth. Risks to our forecast are to the downside as depressed conditions in the energy sector continue to ripple through the Texas economy.\n\nAs a result of a more highly diversified economy as well as the continued migration of people and firms to Texas, I am very optimistic about the growth prospects for Texas and the Eleventh District in the years ahead—particularly as the negative impacts of declining oil prices begin to dissipate.\n\nEconomic Conditions in the U.S. Economy\n\nEstimates of first-quarter GDP growth in the U.S. have been disappointing. Based on a strong consumer, our economists at the Dallas Fed expect that GDP growth will improve over the remainder of this year—and we now forecast growth of approximately 2 percent in 2016. This is sluggish growth by historical standards but should be sufficient to continue to drive down the unemployment rate below the current 5 percent reading.\n\nIn addition to the headline unemployment rate, we also closely watch the labor participation rate, which now stands at approximately 63 percent.[13] While the participation rate is lower than the 66 percent reading in 2007, Dallas Fed economists believe that more than half of the decline is due to aging of the population. We also track estimates of the number of part-time workers who might convert to full time in a stronger job market. Both of these measures have shown signs of improvement in recent months.\n\nIt is my own view that labor market slack needs to be viewed in a global context. That is, excess capacity outside the United States may impact the level of labor slack within the U.S. as companies increasingly think globally about their workforce configuration and deployment. As a result, I believe that we may be able to achieve levels of unemployment that are lower than we have been historically accustomed, without creating near-term inflation pressures.\n\nIn terms of inflation, our economists look at headline levels but also look closely at the Dallas Fed’s Trimmed Mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) measure of core inflation. This measure trims out those items with the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. While the headline measure of inflation has been running well below our 2 percent objective, the 12-month change in the trimmed mean ranged consistently between 1.6 and 1.7 percent from early 2014 until the end of 2015. This measure has ticked up to between 1.8 and 1.9 percent in 2016.[14] These readings give us confidence that headline inflation will ultimately increase toward our 2 percent objective over the medium term.\n\nGlobal Economic Conditions\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed closely monitor economic conditions outside the U.S. because, in a globally connected world, these conditions have the potential to impact the U.S. economy.\n\n2016 estimates of growth outside the U.S. continue to decline. The underlying composition of these growth estimates is highly uneven. In particular, commodity-sensitive countries such as Venezuela, Brazil and Russia are in recession, while most advanced economies show steady but moderate rates of growth.\n\nAs mentioned in my opening comments, most advanced economies are challenged by aging-demographic trends as well as high levels of debt relative to GDP. In my view, both these trends create headwinds for current and future economic growth. These issues are particularly acute in Japan, where the population is declining and its dependency ratio—the ratio of those age 14 and under plus those 65 and over relative to those 15–64—has been rising since the early 1990s.[15] Similar dynamics, although less severe, are also unfolding in Europe.\n\nIn addition, we are closely watching China, given its size and importance to world GDP growth. China grew at a reported rate of 6.9 percent in 2015.[16] We estimate that this growth rate will slow to 6.5 percent in 2016 and likely trend lower in subsequent years.[17] China is dealing with high levels of overcapacity (particularly in state-owned enterprises), high levels of debt and an aging workforce. In addition, it has embarked on a longer-term transition from being an export- and investment-driven economy to one that is dominated by services and the consumer. This is likely to be a very difficult transition, which will play out over many years as opposed to quarters. Given these various challenges, we believe that the world is going to need to adjust to lower levels of Chinese growth in the years ahead.\n\nChina’s challenges are likely to have some spillover effects on emerging-market countries as well as the U.S. and other advanced economies. Possibly more significantly, China’s challenges have the potential to transmit to financial markets through heightened currency volatility as well as periodic bouts of tightening in global financial conditions.\n\nImplications for Monetary Policy\n\nAs you know, the Fed has a mandate to pursue full employment and price stability. Regarding our full-employment objective, I believe we are making good progress toward reaching our goal.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I believe that, in a more interconnected world, labor slack should be assessed in a global context. Excess capacity outside the U.S. may dampen inflation pressures in the U.S. at a given level of unemployment. I am encouraged by the recent uptick in the labor participation rate to 63 percent. I think it suggests that we can make even further progress on so-called discouraged workers reentering the labor force. As a result, we may still have capacity for healthy job growth without overheating the economy or unduly stressing the capacity of the U.S. workforce.\n\nIn terms of price stability, headline inflation continues to run below our 2 percent objective. However, I believe that, as the impacts of lower energy prices and a strong dollar ultimately dissipate, headline inflation will gradually trend toward our core inflation readings. As mentioned earlier, the Trimmed Mean PCE now stands at between 1.8 and 1.9 percent, and we expect this measure to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as we move toward full employment.\n\nI am monitoring how slowing growth, high levels of overcapacity, and high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies outside the U.S. impact economic conditions in the U.S. I am also closely monitoring how these issues might be affecting the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve as well as measures of tightness in financial conditions.\n\nIn light of these challenges, I have been suggesting that removal of accommodation should be done gradually and patiently. I am also very cognizant that, from a risk-management point of view, our monetary policies have an asymmetrical impact at or near the zero lower bound.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the effort to “normalize” monetary policy is important and that excessive accommodation has a cost in terms of creating distortions in investing, hiring and other decisions which can create unhealthy imbalances. These imbalances are often easier to recognize in hindsight and can be very painful to address.\n\nAs a result, as we continue to make progress in achieving our dual mandate, I will advocate that we take actions to remove some amount of accommodation. However, I will also advocate that we take these steps in a gradual and patient manner.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. Now, I would be very happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."

        "content": "March 3, 2016 Dallas\n\nThank you for having me here today. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you.\n\nA little background: I have been president of the Dallas Fed since early September of 2015. Since that time, I have had the opportunity to meet with and get to know business and community leaders and talk with many other people throughout this district (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico). I have attended four Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents as well as with the Board of Governors.\n\nI’ve been impressed with the quality of the people at the Fed and their unwavering commitment to serve the citizens of the nation. I have seen a high level of rigor, intensity and overall excellence in the Fed’s work on monetary policy and supervision, as well as in the various other important functions it performs on behalf of the American people.\n\nSince taking this role, I have developed a much greater appreciation for the complexity of the Fed’s work in analyzing economic conditions and making decisions regarding monetary policy. I have learned that, in a rapidly changing world, there are seldom “no brainer” or easy decisions. This work requires an open mind, intellectual diligence and persistence, a willingness to work through complexity, and a desire to understand arguments and counterarguments. And yes, when appropriate, you have got to be able to change your mind and make balanced judgments in order to serve the nation.\n\nOne key aspect of the Fed is the vital role played by members of the private sector as well as community leaders in our work. On the Dallas Fed boards of directors, which include our branch boards in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, we have business, community and nonprofit leaders with diverse geographic, cultural and functional backgrounds. They spend a substantial amount of time with us sharing valuable insights regarding economic trends and overall economic conditions.\n\nIn addition, hundreds of private sector businesses in our district regularly participate in our manufacturing, service sector, agricultural, energy and Beige Book surveys.[1] These surveys are an essential information source regarding conditions in our region. In addition to these activities, before every FOMC meeting, I speak with numerous industry leaders to discuss their insights regarding economic conditions in the district, the nation and the rest of the world. Our economic research and policy work is dramatically enhanced by the enormous contribution of time from this diverse group of leaders. Their contributions are essential to our ability to make sound decisions for the country.\n\nWith that background, let me make a few comments on economic conditions in the district, the nation and the world. I will then comment on implications of these conditions for monetary policy.\n\nThe Eleventh District: Discussion of Energy\n\nIt is our view at the Dallas Fed that, in 2016, global energy production will exceed consumption by an average of approximately 1 million barrels per day.[2] By year-end, we believe that this excess will decline to approximately 500,000 barrels per day.[3] We expect that global demand will grow by approximately 1.2 million barrels per day in 2016.[4]\n\nOECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) inventories continue to increase and now stand at roughly 400 million barrels above the historical five-year average.[5] These excess inventory levels will increase through 2016, and there is now some discussion in the industry about potential limits in storage capacity.\n\nWe estimate that the market will not find some degree of daily production/consumption balance until mid-2017 and, at that point, excess inventories will begin to decline. This forecast has been influenced over the past several months by the official return of Iran to the world oil markets, increased supply from OPEC nations, slower-than-expected supply declines from U.S. producers despite substantial cuts in drilling and capital spending, and slower-than-expected demand from emerging-market countries. This outlook would be meaningfully impacted by a change in OPEC production strategy.\n\nGiven these various factors, the ultimate timing of market production/consumption balance remains uncertain. In the meantime, we expect to see continued low prices and high levels of price volatility, as well as more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry.\n\nOne by-product of lower oil prices is wider credit spreads in the high-yield market. Because corporate energy issuers comprise a material portion of high-yield issuance, and because high-yield debt is heavily held in mutual-fund (with daily liquidity obligations) and exchange-traded fund form, weakness in the energy sector has the potential to create increased levels of fund redemptions. This, in turn, can put pressure on funds to sell holdings more broadly in order to meet liquidity needs. This is a good example of the potential negative ripple effects that can come from persistent weakness in the energy sector.\n\nBroad Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District\n\nAs has been the case for the past year, the Eleventh District is being adversely affected by low oil prices as well as the strength of the dollar. As a result of these challenges, Texas job growth slowed from 3.6 percent in 2014 to 1.5 percent in 2015, and Dallas Fed economists expect only about 1 percent growth in 2016.[6] Risks to this forecast are to the downside if oil stays at or below $30 per barrel for an extended period.\n\nWhile the nation’s unemployment rate has declined since the beginning of 2015, the Texas unemployment rate increased from 4.4 percent at the beginning of the year to 4.6 percent at year-end.[7] We expect the state unemployment rate to rise further in 2016 even as the national unemployment rate continues to fall.\n\nIn 2015, the Texas energy and manufacturing sectors lost jobs while the state’s service sector showed steady, moderate growth.[8] This recent economic performance has been bolstered by the diversified nature of the Texas economy. While Houston’s growth has been brought to a halt by the energy downturn, Austin, Dallas and San Antonio have shown strong growth and continue to attract people and firms from around the country and the world.\n\nThe energy industry accounted for approximately 2 percent of Texas employment[9] and approximately 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015,[10] a good deal lower than in the 1980s, when that oil bust pushed the Texas economy into a major recession. While the downturn in the energy industry has created negative ripple effects in the state, the Texas economy has proven to be highly resilient. I expect this resiliency and underlying strength to continue as the negative impacts of energy begin to dissipate in the years ahead.\n\nEconomic Conditions in the Nation\n\nGross Domestic Product and Unemployment\nThe Commerce Department estimates that the U.S. economy grew 1.9 percent in 2015, and our economists expect a similar rate of growth in 2016.[11] This rate of GDP growth, while sluggish by historical standards, was sufficient to drive down the U.S. unemployment rate from 5.6 percent at the start of the year to approximately 5 percent by year-end, and to 4.9 percent in January.[12]\n\nThe service sector continues to be the primary driver of growth in the U.S. economy. In contrast, the manufacturing sector continues to struggle as a result of a strong dollar and continued weakness outside the U.S.\n\nOur economists expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline in 2016, but at a slower pace. In addition to looking at the headline rate, we also track other measures that gauge the degree of slack in the labor market. In particular, we closely monitor the labor force participation rate, which is the share of the population that is either employed or actively looking for work. This share is currently 62.7 percent, which is approximately 3.5 percentage points below its prerecession level.[13] Our Dallas Fed economists believe that over one-half of this decline is explained by aging-workforce demographics. We are also tracking measures of “discouraged” workers, who have given up looking for work, as well as estimates of the number of part-time workers who might convert to full time in a stronger job market.\n\nMy own view is that overcapacity in non-U.S. economies must be considered along with domestic labor slack in assessing the implications of a given U.S. unemployment rate. In an increasingly globalized world, U.S. companies assess their employment decisions in a global context. As a result, I believe that the headline rate which constitutes “full employment” will likely be lower than the level to which we have historically been accustomed.\n\nInflation\nHeadline inflation readings continue to run below the 2 percent long-run objective set by the FOMC. A stronger dollar and lower oil prices are two key factors that are negatively impacting the rate of inflation.\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, we attempt to look past more transitory factors by focusing on the Trimmed Mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate, which excludes those items with the most extreme upward and downward monthly price movements. Since early 2014, the 12-month change in the trimmed mean ran between 1.6 and 1.7 percent. In January 2016, the 12-month rate ticked up to approximately 1.9 percent. The stability and trend of this measure are important to track as we consider inflation prospects over the medium term.\n\nI will be closely watching these measures as well as the impact of anticipated further reductions in labor market slack in assessing the Fed’s progress toward meeting its 2 percent objective. I will also be monitoring the impact of key secular trends discussed later in this speech.\n\nWorld Economic Conditions\n\n\n\nOur economists at the Dallas Fed have lowered their expectations for growth outside the U.S. In 2016, we expect global growth, excluding the U.S., to be approximately 2.7 percent. This includes negative growth in commodity-exposed countries such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela as well as 7.4 percent GDP growth in India.[14] This estimate of the non-U.S. growth rate comes with a high level of downside risk.\n\nOne particular concern is China, which is trying to manage high levels of industrial overcapacity, high levels of leverage, aging demographics, and decreasing levels of reserves (which they have used to manage their currency devaluations). China is also working to manage a longer-term transition from a manufacturing and export-driven economy to one that is more consumer and service-sector based.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts that China’s growth rate will slow to approximately 6.3 percent in 2016 from 6.9 percent in 2015. Whatever the actual number, it seems clear that the world will have to adjust to lower rates of Chinese growth in the years ahead. China’s economic challenges have the potential to create negative spillovers that impact economic conditions in the U.S. as well as other economies.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nAs a businessperson, I am regularly reminded that it is important to be open to learning from and adapting to changing circumstances. It is important to avoid being rigid, closed minded, or ideological in my thinking. Asking the right questions is more important than having all the answers. With that preamble, let me discuss my views regarding monetary policy.\n\nFrom January 1 through March 1 this year, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of stocks declined approximately 3.2 percent.[15] Global stock markets (excluding the U.S.) declined approximately 6 percent.[16] The 10-year Treasury rate declined from 2.27 percent to 1.82 percent.[17] The price of oil declined from $37.13 per barrel to $34.39.[18] The U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen moved from 120.38 yen/dollar to 113.17.[19] In that period, China devalued its currency. Investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads widened.\n\nSuffice it to say that global financial conditions have tightened. This tightening is likely to have had a restraining impact on the underlying pace of economic activity akin to some level of increase in the fed funds rate.\n\nOne obvious question is the extent to which a decline in the S&P is reflective of meaningfully weaker economic conditions in the U.S. In assessing this question, it is worth noting that the S&P is not the same as the U.S. economy. In particular, S&P 500 firms derive about 38 percent of their revenue[20] and as much as 50 percent[21] of their earnings from outside the U.S., while only about 11 percent of U.S. GDP is derived from exports.[22] The S&P decline may suggest weaker expectations among market participants for corporate earnings due to slowing global growth and wider credit spreads as well as a stronger dollar. It may also reflect some level of normal and healthy market revaluation.\n\nOn the positive side, lower oil prices and a stronger dollar should benefit the U.S. consumer. Due to a strong consumer, my own expectation is that the U.S. economy will likely be resilient in 2016. Having said that, I believe that recent developments call for patience and further diligence in assessing the impacts of slowing global growth and tighter financial conditions on the U.S. economy.\n\nIn addition, I am also closely monitoring the impact of key secular trends relating to high levels of debt and aging demographics in the United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China. These secular factors could create downward pressure on potential growth rates and, all things being equal, tend to lower the so-called “neutral” rate, the interest rate at which the Fed is neither restrictive nor accommodative.\n\nWhile I believe that excessive accommodation carries a cost in terms of distortions and imbalances in hiring, asset allocation and investment decisions, I also believe that, at this juncture, the Fed needs to show patience in decisions to remove accommodation. Again, this is particularly true in light of key global secular trends as well as recent developments relating to slowing global economic growth and tightening financial conditions.\n\nI believe that the Fed should avoid having a predetermined mindset regarding the path of policy. This path should be driven by our ongoing analyses of cyclical as well as secular trends.\n\nI think it makes sense to emphasize that, at this juncture, monetary policy remains accommodative; although I would note again that policy is somewhat less accommodative than it was on January 1 in light of tightening global financial conditions.\n\nLastly, I would emphasize that monetary policy should serve as an element of overall economic policy. It is not designed to act in isolation or as a substitute for fiscal policy or structural reforms. There are limits to the potential impacts of monetary policy.\n\nThe broad domestic secular challenges of an aging population, access to education and health care, underinvestment in infrastructure, high levels of debt to GDP, and projected stresses on our ability to meet future obligations for retirement and medical benefits are all examples of issues that may affect the long-run path of sustainable economic growth. While monetary policy has a critical role to play in promoting good economic performance and price stability, it has limitations in being able to address these longer-run issues.\n\nNow, I would be very happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."

        "content": "January 11, 2016 Dallas\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. Thank you for having me here this evening. It’s a great pleasure for me to speak with you.\n\nFor those who I haven’t had a chance to meet yet, I was an investment banker and financial services executive for almost 23 years and then a professor at Harvard Business School for 10 years. I grew up in Kansas, went to the University of Kansas and spent a lot of time as a youngster traveling the state of Texas with my father, who was a jewelry salesman. I have always had a desire to do public service, so I was very glad to have the opportunity to lead the Dallas Fed.\n\nI have been president of the Dallas Fed since the beginning of September. It’s a great honor to be able to serve the people of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District (which includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico) and the nation. I have spent the past four months getting to know business and community leaders, as well as talking with many other people throughout this district. I have attended three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings and developed good working relationships with the other Federal Reserve Bank presidents as well as the Board of Governors.\n\nI have been impressed with the people who live and work in this district and with our dedicated staff at the Dallas Fed, as well as those who work in the Federal Reserve System across the nation. I say regularly that, as a citizen, if you could see what I get to see every day, you would be very proud and gratified by the work of the people of the Federal Reserve.\n\nWith that background, I’d like to speak tonight about the regional, national and global economies and then talk about implications for monetary policy. If there’s a theme, it’s how the world has changed and keeps changing. Our job at the Fed is to work to understand these changes, be continually open to learning and asking questions, and then strive to make good decisions for the citizens of this country.\n\nAs I speak this evening, my remarks represent my own views and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.\n\nThe Eleventh District: Discussion of Energy\n\nI’ll begin my remarks with a discussion of the energy industry, given its vital importance to this district and the nation. Since the December Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting, the overall tone in the oil and gas sector has soured, as expectations have decidedly shifted to an “even lower for even longer” price outlook.\n\nOPEC seems to have abandoned any pretense of production quotas, and Saudi Arabia seems to be determined to maintain its market share of production. As a consequence, it appears that any reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia will have to be accompanied by proportionate declines from other middle-eastern nations and Russia—this, so far, seems unlikely.\n\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) inventories continue to increase and now stand at roughly 300 million barrels above their historical five-year average.[1] For 2015, the Department of Energy estimates that global supply exceeded global demand by an average of 1.7 million barrels per day.[2] As of today, this gap has declined to approximately 1 million barrels per day and is expected to ultimately drop to 600,000 barrels per day by year-end 2016.[3] Our economists at the Dallas Fed believe that global excess inventories aren’t likely to begin falling until 2017. If we are wrong, the risks are that this rebalancing process will take even longer.\n\nThis situation is further complicated by the expectation that Iran sanctions will likely be lifted in early 2016, and Iran will increase its production shortly thereafter. Furthermore, our industry contacts suggest that Iran has 30–40 million barrels of oil in storage which, over time, could be sold into the world markets. The prospect of all or a portion of this supply coming into the market sooner than expected has increased uncertainty and negatively impacted oil prices.\n\nAnother complicating factor is that, despite rig count declines and additional cuts in capital spending, U.S. oil production declines have been slow to materialize. This reflects increased output from the Gulf of Mexico, the time lag between capital spending cuts and production declines, as well as the fact that shale-well productivity has improved over the past several years.\n\nAll this suggests that 2016 will be a challenging year for oil producers. On the positive side, lower oil prices translate into lower gasoline prices for consumers. These lower prices have helped generate stronger automobile driving activity as well as record auto sales in the U.S., and underpin our expectation of a 1.4-million-barrel-per-day increase in global consumption in 2016.[4]\n\nGiven these various cross-currents, the ultimate timing of reaching market production/consumption balance remains uncertain. As a consequence, we expect to see continued low prices and price volatility, as well as more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings in the energy industry.\n\nBroad Economic Conditions in the Eleventh District\n\nCertainly, the Eleventh District economy has been adversely impacted by low oil prices as well as strength in the dollar. As a result of these challenges, Texas job growth slowed to approximately 1.3 percent in 2015, and Dallas Fed economists expect similar growth in 2016.[5] This compares with the 3.6 percent job growth the state experienced in 2014.[6]\n\nWhile the Texas energy and manufacturing sectors have been losing jobs, the state’s service sector has shown steady, moderate expansion. We have seen particular strength in the health care and the leisure and hospitality industries. We have also seen recent strength in construction employment in the state.\n\nIt is worth noting that migration of firms and people has been a key underpinning of economic growth in this state. Since 2000, the average annual rate of population growth in Texas has been almost a full percentage point higher than the rest of the nation.[7] Despite some slowing due to the downturn in energy, I expect this migration trend to continue albeit at a slower rate. Due to the diversified nature of the state’s economy and continued attractiveness of the state as a destination for firms and people, I am very optimistic about the resiliency and overall economic outlook for this district in the years ahead.\n\nEconomic Conditions in the Nation\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) and Employment\nDallas Fed economists estimate that the U.S. economy grew approximately 2 percent in 2015. While this rate of growth is sluggish by historical standards, it was sufficient to drive down the rate of unemployment from 5.6 percent at the beginning of the year to 5.0 percent by year-end.[8] Our economists expect 2016 GDP growth of somewhere between 2.0 and 2.5 percent.\n\nAs with the Eleventh District, the U.S. service sector has been the primary growth engine in the United States. A strong dollar combined with relatively weak growth abroad continues to weigh on U.S. manufacturing and net exports.\n\nIn 2015, nonfarm payroll job growth averaged 221,000 jobs per month. Dallas Fed economists estimate that the economy needs to add somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs per month in order to keep the unemployment rate roughly constant. We expect sufficient job growth in 2016 to continue to drive down the rate of unemployment.\n\nTo gauge progress toward our full-employment mandate, we closely monitor various measures of labor market slack beyond the headline unemployment rate. In particular, we look at the labor force participation rate, which is the share of the population age 16 and older that is either employed or actively looking for work. This percentage is currently at 62.6 percent, which is 3.5 percentage points lower than its prerecession level.[9] At the Dallas Fed, we assess that while some of this decline is cyclical, more than half is due to aging workforce demographics. (I’ll talk more about this in a few moments.)\n\nWe also closely monitor the number of “would be” workers who are “discouraged” and have given up looking for work, as well as the number of part-time workers who would convert to full time in a stronger job market. Both of these measures have recently shown improvement, which suggests to us that labor slack is declining and we are making progress toward our full-employment objective.\n\nInflation\nHeadline inflation readings continue to run below the 2 percent longer-run objective set by the Federal Reserve. In November, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index was only 0.4 percent higher than a year earlier.[10]\n\nAt the Dallas Fed, our preferred measure of inflation is the Trimmed Mean PCE inflation rate, which “trims out” items with the most extreme upward or downward monthly changes. We believe this trimming gives us a measure of trend inflation that is more reliable than so-called “core” inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. The 12-month change in the trimmed mean has run between 1.6 and 1.7 percent since early 2014. The stability of this measure, in combination with anticipated further reductions in labor market slack, gives us confidence that headline PCE inflation will gradually increase to 2 percent by year-end 2017.\n\nWorld Economic Conditions\n\nWe estimate that 2015 global GDP growth, excluding the U.S., was 2.5 percent.[11] This headline growth rate masks a very uneven underlying picture. For example, emerging economies with high levels of exposure to commodities showed significant declines in growth rates. Brazil, Russia and Venezuela were in outright recession during 2015, and we expect negative GDP growth again in these countries in 2016. On the other hand, India’s GDP growth rate was 7.3 percent in 2015 and is expected to increase further in 2016.[12]\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, Dallas Fed economists expect global growth, excluding the U.S., to gradually improve to 2.9 percent. While this reflects improvements in both advanced as well as emerging-market economies, it is relatively sluggish compared with past rates of growth and comes with some meaningful level of downside risk.\n\nOne potential concern is China. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that China growth will slow to approximately 6.3 percent in 2016 versus a reported growth rate of 6.9 percent in 2015.[13] This slowing has been manifested in dramatic swings in the Chinese stock market (which have, in turn, spilled over into global financial markets), as well as in Chinese government actions intended to address some of their key economic challenges.\n\nOvercapacity in key industries (particularly in state-owned enterprises), higher levels of leverage, and aging demographics are key challenges likely to impede growth. These issues are secular and will take years to address. In addition, China has embarked on a longer-term initiative to transition its economy to be more consumer and service-sector based from one that is heavily manufacturing and export based.\n\nAs a result of these factors, it seems probable that the world will have to adjust to lower levels of Chinese growth in the years ahead. Slower Chinese growth has the potential to further impact commodity prices and create headwinds for GDP growth in the U.S. and other economies.\n\nOpenness to Learning in a Changing World\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I grew up in Kansas and went to college in Kansas. As I was starting my professional career, there were a few things that I (and seemingly) everyone else knew to be true:\n\nWe had never heard of the Internet, mobile devices or online news/content providers, which would allow us to get information immediately and would substantially disrupt the traditional newspaper industry. Japan suffered through decades of slow growth and increasingly challenging issues with high levels of government debt, a shrinking population and aging demographics. And we know what happened with housing and interest rates.\n\nThe point is, what we know “for sure” is not always correct. The world evolves, and we have to be open-minded and adapt to the changes. We have to be willing to learn and, when the facts warrant, modify our views. This way of thinking is particularly important to me as a participant in the monetary policy deliberations of the FOMC.\n\nBecause the world has changed and keeps changing, some of the key tools we use to assess economic conditions must be assessed and reassessed in this context. For example, the Phillips curve has been a critical tool in analyzing the interaction of unemployment rates with inflation. In this current recovery, we are moving toward increasingly low rates of unemployment, but we have not yet seen an increase in headline inflation. Of course, this inflation shortfall may be due to transitory factors, but we are also aware there may be other more fundamental issues at play here.\n\nAdditionally, during this recovery, the labor-force participation rate has remained low by historical standards. As a result, some have questioned whether the headline unemployment rate remains the best measure of labor slack.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nI believe there are several key factors that may be impacting economic conditions and should influence the way we think about monetary policy.\n\nDemographic Trends\nThe United States and other major economies, including Europe, Japan and China, are all facing the challenge of aging demographics. For example, in the United States, as the baby-boomer generation moves into retirement age, the fraction of the labor force age 55 or older is projected to increase from approximately 21.7 percent in 2014 to almost 25 percent in 2024.[14] Looking further ahead, the median age of the labor force is expected to rise steadily through 2060.[15]\n\nAging demographics are likely to negatively impact labor force participation rates. As I mentioned earlier, the labor force participation rate in the U.S. has fallen about 3.5 percentage points since late 2007.[16] While the 2008–09 recession certainly had a great impact, we believe that more than half of the decline can be explained by aging. Individuals age 55 and over tend to have lower participation rates than do younger individuals.\n\nBased on current demographic trends, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the overall labor force participation rate will decline 2 percentage points further to 60.9 percent by 2024.[17] Since GDP growth is substantially impacted by growth in the labor force plus improvements in labor productivity, these trends suggest that, assuming no mitigating actions are taken, potential GDP growth rates may well be negatively impacted in the future.\n\nIn addition, these demographics suggest that the “dependency ratio”—which is crudely measured as the ratio of population under age 18 or over 64 to the population 18–64—will rise. The implication is that an increasing share of the population will “depend” on those of working age to pay for future medical and retirement benefits. This higher dependency ratio may have implications for the ability of countries to meet their obligations for retirement and medical benefits.\n\nOf course, these demographic forecasts are just that—forecasts. Policymakers and other agents have the ability to take actions, and events can occur, which alter or offset these trends, improve productivity or otherwise mitigate their impact. The point is that, as policymakers, we have to be aware of them and be open to adjusting our thinking and our policies in ways that take them into account.\n\nLevels of Debt to GDP\nAnother factor potentially impacting economic conditions is growth in the levels of debt relative to GDP. For much of my lifetime, the household, business and government sectors of the United States have been able to increase their levels of debt relative to overall GDP. This has had the effect, during some periods, of increasing GDP growth rates. Some have referred to this as the so-called “debt super cycle” and suggested that, in the future, additional borrowing will more likely need to be supported by corresponding growth in incomes.\n\nCertainly, since the Great Recession, the household sector in the U.S. has been deleveraging. However, business debt as a share of GDP has grown somewhat (although importantly, the financial sector has deleveraged), and government debt to GDP has also risen. Currently, federal debt held by the public is approximately 73 percent of GDP, up from 33 percent in 2000[18] and, in addition, the present value of future unfunded obligations for Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be approximately $40 trillion.[19] These unfunded nondiscretionary obligations are expected to cause the U.S. budget deficit to materially increase as a percentage of GDP over the next 10 years and beyond.[20] This path may prove to be unsustainable.\n\nOutside the U.S., high levels of debt to GDP in certain countries are likely to impact these countries’ future ability to grow. China and Japan, for example, may find it difficult to stimulate GDP by growing debt beyond levels supported by income growth.\n\nThe level of borrowing relative to GDP is a key factor I will be watching, in the U.S. and abroad, in assessing economic conditions in the months and years ahead.\n\nGlobalization\nToday, U.S. companies are able to source and produce products and services in multiple countries to lower their costs. Increasingly, U.S. consumers are able to benefit from lower-cost imports as well as lower-cost services due to globalization. Companies increasingly think about their labor, products and services with a global mindset. This greater amount of global connectivity means that economic conditions in each country can much more quickly impact economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nOne implication of this is that domestic labor slack has to be assessed in a global context. This means that the headline unemployment rate necessary to achieve full employment can likely be lower for a time than we’ve been historically accustomed to without triggering undue inflation pressures.\n\nThe point is that, as the world becomes even more interconnected and the “transmission” of global economic conditions accelerates, we have to increasingly consider world economic conditions in assessing our own.\n\nIncreasing Rates of Disruption\nConsumers increasingly are able to use technology to rapidly compare prices for goods and services. In addition, new business models are emerging, which offer products and services that “disrupt” older models—think Uber versus a taxi or car service, Airbnb versus a hotel room, Amazon versus a retail store. These new business models are having the impact of lowering prices and improving service and convenience. They are also helping improve the bargaining power of consumers.\n\nThese trends are encouraging many companies to look for new ways to use technology to lower their costs as well as improve productivity and customer service. It may be hard to measure, but I certainly believe these changes are putting some downward pressure on the prices of many types of goods and services.\n\nCertainly, there are various exceptions to this trend such as prescription drugs and affordable luxuries (like a Starbucks coffee). However, increasingly, business models are being disrupted in ways that would not have been imagined only a few years ago. These changes are impacting the way companies think about traditional capital spending and their choices for how to spend additional resources.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the ultimate impacts of aging demographics, high levels of indebtedness, globalization and increasing disruption. However, these are key issues that policymakers will need to better understand in order to assess economic conditions and formulate appropriate economic policies.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nI agree with, and argued for, the decision made in December by the FOMC to increase the federal funds rate. In our post-FOMC meeting statement, we emphasized that, even with this increase, monetary policy remains accommodative. We also emphasized that future removals of accommodation will likely be done gradually and will depend on our ongoing assessment of incoming economic data and overall economic conditions.\n\nAs we go forward, I will be closely monitoring various measures of labor market slack to assess progress toward our full-employment objective. As the unemployment rate moves below 5 percent, I would expect to see the inflation rate gradually increase toward our 2 percent objective in the medium term. Additionally, our economists will be considering how a stronger dollar and more subdued rates of growth outside the U.S. might adversely affect GDP, unemployment and inflation in this country. We’ll also be working to better understand the potential impact of some of the secular issues I have discussed tonight.\n\nI believe that continuing along the path of monetary policy normalization is important. There are various costs to maintaining excessive accommodation for too long—particularly in terms of potential distortions in investment, inventory and hiring decisions, which may need to be (painfully) unwound when policy normalizes. My experience is that these imbalances are sometimes easier to recognize in hindsight.\n\nIn thinking about these questions, we’re sensitive to the fact that monetary policy affects the economy with a lag. As consequence, if we delay further normalization until we actually see evidence of excessive accommodation, there is a risk that we will have waited too long.\n\nIn addition, as we go through this period, I would not be surprised to see more bouts of volatility in the financial markets. The challenge for policymakers is to appropriately consider these movements, without over-reading or misinterpreting them, in assessing underlying economic conditions.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to speak today. I look forward to getting to know you better in the months and years ahead. Now, I would be very happy to take your questions.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System."
