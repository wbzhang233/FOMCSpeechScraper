        "content": "December 16, 2011 Austin, Texas\n\nThank you, Bobby [Jenkins]. It is an honor to speak at the 2012 Economic Forecast Luncheon. I am a poor substitute for the last of my Federal Reserve brethren to appear before this chamber—Ben Bernanke. The chairman would have enjoyed congratulating the brave souls from four of our leading universities who ventured forth last year to make their winning forecasts, which you have celebrated here today.\n\nIt is noteworthy that even the winners of this year’s forecasting sweepstakes were not insignificantly off the mark of what actually occurred in the national economy, with the exception of Dr. Gardner’s and Dr. Gilligan’s spot-on forecast for the prime rate. We know from our experience on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that forecasting the economy these days has become difficult. During the course of the year, we saw large shifts in the outlook for growth, inflation and unemployment, reflecting the obvious fact that we are in an unfamiliar and rapidly changing economic environment. My undergraduate economics professor, John Kenneth Galbraith, used to chide that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.” Even though they were not spot-on, today’s forecast winners make economists look respectable, and I thank them for it.\n\nI hesitate to single out any one winner but I am compelled to do so, as Tom Saving is the father of Jason Saving, one of our very able economists at the Dallas Fed. The sins of the father have been visited on the son! Happily, so has a great virtue. In a recent New York Times article, Greg Mankiw wrote, “A prerequisite for being a good economist is an ample dose of humility.”[1] Like father, like son—Saving Senior and Junior both share a sense of humility, which is why I respect both of them so much.\n\nThis has been a remarkable year. The great comedic writer P.G. Wodehouse pretty much summed it up when he wrote that “just when a (fellow) is feeling particularly braced with things in general ... Fate sneaks up behind him with a bit of lead piping.”[2]\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I felt pretty confident, if not exactly “braced,” that we were on the path to recovery, albeit I projected a slow, jerky one. My forecasting skills are certainly not on par with those honored here today. But I am on record for calling the bottom of the recession in an interview published in the Dallas Morning News on Aug. 26, 2009, some 15 months before the official arbiter of recessions and recoveries—the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)—did. NBER pegged the beginning of the recovery as occurring at the beginning of the third quarter of 2009.[3]\n\nAt the time, I stated that while the recession may be over, the recovery would be a “slow slog.” My colleague, Mark Wynne, director of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, is fond of citing the ceremony that honors Saint Willibrord, the Catholic Church’s patron saint of convulsions. Every year in Luxembourg, there is a Willibrord procession. Participants proceed in a shuffle, taking two steps forward, then one step back. One might say that we at the Dallas Fed envisioned a Willibrord-like recovery—one that would be halting and given to occasional reversal and convulsions. However, barring some exogenous shock, we forecast the recovery would proceed slowly, gaining momentum over time. This is indeed what has occurred, despite the doubters and skeptics, over the past two years.\n\nIn a nutshell, my vision has been as follows: In 2008, businesses were experiencing cost-push pressures. They discovered they could not price the goods and services they were selling aggressively enough to match rising production costs. Headline inflation for both June and July 2008 was scored at an annualized rate of 11 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index; the 12-month rate in July 2008 was 5.5 percent—the highest level since January 1991. Driven by fear that inflation was beginning to systematically take root, and aided by an acceleration in the ability to harness productivity-enhancing technology and more sophisticated exploitation of globalization, businesses began to focus in earnest on cost containment. They began this process with their largest cost center, labor. When the Panic of 2008–09 struck in late summer, they doubled down on their cost-control initiatives. Final demand imploded; pricing power vanished; the prospect of top-line growth evaporated. To preserve margins, cost-control management became even more aggressive, with the result that labor took it in the neck and unemployment skyrocketed.\n\nToday, over three years into this dynamic, businesses remain cautious about cost control and adding significantly to payrolls and job-creating domestic capex. This is despite being awash in liquidity. The Federal Reserve has flooded the markets with cheap, readily available money. The private sector, the wellspring of productive job creation, now has the financial means to grow employment. But it lacks the incentive to do so.\n\nIf anything, I feel that my colleagues on the FOMC have exceeded the amounts necessary to fuel the needs of job creators. I balked at pledging to hold rates low through mid-2013, and felt that “Operation Twist” would be of doubtful efficacy except in making some quick profits for those market players who bought on the (regrettably too well circulated) rumor and sold on the news of the FOMC announcement. Despite what the Wall Street Journal wrote under my picture in Wednesday’s edition, I did not “vote (twice) against FOMC moves to push down long-term rates for fear they would generate inflation.”[4] I am, and always will be, a “hawk” on the inflationary front. But I voted against those initiatives because I felt that under the circumstances, they would do little to encourage job formation.\n\nWithin the FOMC and in many public speeches, I have argued that based on anecdotal soundings from the businesses I survey, and applying the rigorous analysis we do at the Dallas Fed in calculating the Trimmed Mean for Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE), inflation would likely move toward the 2 percent range as the year wore on.[5] The Consumer Price Index (CPI) report issued this morning confirms that downward trend (so Tom Saving might wish to revise his forecast down from the 4.5 percent he predicted for 2011). Today’s CPI report appears to confirm our expectation. I expect that companies who pushed through prices rather aggressively in 2011 will likely effect rollbacks in 2012, mitigating the headline price pressures we experienced this year. I have argued as much at the FOMC table.\n\nMy reluctance to support greater monetary accommodation has been based on efficacy: With businesses’ cash flow—driven by record high profits and bonus depreciation—at an all-time high, both absolutely and as a percentage of GDP; with every survey, including those of small businesses, indicating that access to capital is widely available and attractively priced;[6] with balance sheets having been amply reconfigured; and with bankers and nondepository financial institutions sitting on copious amounts of excess liquidity, I have argued that further accommodation was unlikely to motivate the private sector to put people back to work. It might even prove counterproductive should it give rise to fears the Fed is so hidebound by academic theory as to be blind to the practical consequences of harboring an ever-expanding balance sheet. This inevitably raises concerns we are creating distortions in the fixed income markets that inhibit proper market functioning, or concerns that—despite our protestations to the contrary—we are given to monetizing the government’s debt, an impulse that ultimately destroys a central bank’s credibility.\n\nI have argued that other, nonmonetary factors are inhibiting the robust job creation we all seek.\n\nOne of the inhibiting factors is the palpable concern about the future of final demand. It has slowly begun to strengthen domestically, yet developments in Europe, a slowdown in growth in emerging economies such as China and Brazil, and concerns about financial trip wires that might be triggered, give rise to caution. On the foreign front, we are innocent bystanders: There is little we can do but pray that fiscal and monetary authorities abroad get it right. So far, their moves have been less than reassuring. The Chinese have not provided convincing proof that they will be able to contain the pricking of their real estate bubble or the shadow banking industry that enabled it. This has led some to posit that Chinese growth may slow beyond the consensus expectation of China watchers. And as for the Europeans, one might say in the spirit of the season that when analysts opened the present wrapped and re-bowed by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy in Brussels last week, it included that dreaded little note saying “assembly required,” had at least one part, Britain, missing and others—Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic—that may not fit.\n\nOne of the Dallas Fed’s astute economists, John Duca, has lately adopted the mantra that “Main Street Heals While Kaiser Street Reels” (29 Kaiserstrasse is the European Central Bank’s address). Recent real side indicators and financial market movements indicate a striking dichotomy between improving economic indicators here at home and signs that financial markets and economies continue to sour on the other side of the Atlantic. Thus, just as we had come to see the light of an evolving domestic recovery, one senses Europe, and possibly the emerging economies, sneaking up behind us, Wodehousean-pipe in hand, poised to knock us off course.\n\nThe brows of economic forecasters and business operators begin to furrow when contemplating the international landscape. But the face of both the economist and businessman turn into something akin to Edvard Munch’s Scream when contemplating the frightful consequences of indecision and political mischief at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.\n\nI maintain that no matter how much cash you have on your balance sheet, or how compliant your banker might be, or how cheap the cost of money, you will not commit substantial capital to expanding your payroll or investing significant amounts to expand plant and equipment until you know what it will cost you to run your business; until you know how much you will be taxed; until you know how federal spending will impact your customer base; until you know the cost of employee health insurance; until you are reassured that regulations that affect your business will be structured so as to incentivize rather than discourage expansion; until you have concrete assurance that the fiscal “fix” the nation so desperately needs will be crafted to stimulate the economy rather than depress it and incentivize job creation rather than discourage it; or until you are reassured that the sinkhole of unfunded liabilities like Medicare and Social Security that Republican- and Democrat-led congresses and presidents alike have dug will be repaired so that our successor generations of Americans will prosper rather than drown in dark, deep waters of debt.\n\nMy colleague Sarah Bloom Raskin—one of the newest Fed governors, and a woman possessed with a disarming ability to speak in non-quadratic-equation English—recently used the example of the common kitchen sink to illustrate a point. I am going to purloin her metaphor for my description of our present predicament. You give a dinner party. The guests leave and you are washing the dishes. When you are done, you notice the remnants of the party are clogging the sink: bits of food, coffee grinds, a hair or two and the like. You have two choices. You can reach down and scoop up the gunk, a distinctly unpleasant task. Or you can turn the water on full blast, washing the gunk down the drain, providing immediate relief from both the eyesore and the distasteful job of handling the mess. You look over your shoulder to make sure your kids aren’t looking, and, voilà, you turn the faucet on full blast, washing your immediate troubles away.\n\nFrom my standpoint, resorting to further monetary accommodation to clean out the sink, clogged by the flotsam and jetsam of a jolly, drunken fiscal and financial party that has gone on far too long, is the wrong path to follow. It may provide immediate relief but risks destroying the plumbing of the entire house. It is a pyrrhic solution that ultimately comes at a devastating cost. Better that the Congress and the president—the makers of fiscal policy and regulation—roll up their sleeves and get on with the yucky task of cleaning out the clogged drain.\n\nThe former prime minister of New Zealand, Mike Moore, has written a book titled Saving Globalization: Why Globalization and Democracy Offer the Best Hope for Progress, Peace and Development. He dedicates it “to honorable public servants, elected or otherwise” and adds a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. To remind them of their ultimate duty as leaders of democratic societies, King said:\n\n“Cowardice asks the question—is it safe? Expediency asks the question—is it politic? Vanity asks the question—is it popular? But conscience asks the question—is it right? … There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right.”[7]\n\nThat time is now. Our nation’s economy is at risk. The Federal Reserve has done everything it can to reduce unemployment without forsaking our sacred commitment to maintaining price stability, or crossing over the monetary river Styx into full-blown debt monetization. I personally don’t care which party is in the White House or controls Congress. All I know is that the “honorable” members of Congress and presidents past, Republicans and Democrats alike, have conspired over time, however unwittingly, to drive fiscal policy into the ditch. They purchased their elections and reelections with popular programs so poorly funded that they now threaten the economic well-being of our children and our children’s children. Instead of passing the torch on to the successor generation of Americans, they have simply passed them the bill. This is the opposite of honorable.\n\nLike all of you here, I am sickened by our politicians’ tendency to kick the can down the road, even when it is starkly clear that doing so jeopardizes America’s well-being. Small wonder that some recent polls show only 9 percent of the American people view Congress favorably. (One senator posited that the 9 percent consisted of blood relatives and congressional staff!)\n\nBut this is the holiday season, and especially now, I am given to viewing the world through optimistic eyes. The Christmas spirit may be overwhelming my judgment, but I believe that the American people—from the mainstream to the Tea Party to the unemployed and disaffected who have taken to the streets—are in the process of forcing politicians to get their act together. There is a loud, distinct, clarion call for leadership—for the people we entrust to right the rules that determine our economic future, cast away cowardice, expediency and vanity, and get on with leading us out of our fiscal wilderness.\n\nAt this time of year, I always count my many blessings. My brother, Mike, is here today; he has finally seen the light and has moved to Texas after a long and successful career in institutional asset management in New York and California. I admire him for more than his professional accomplishments. We experienced some rough times when we were kids, and he always stepped into the breach, forgoing the pleasures of his teenage years by working tough jobs so he could pay the rent and put food on our family table when things were not going well for our father. Thanks to Mike, we survived those difficult times and went on to live the American dream.\n\nMy brother and I know how blessed we are that our parents chose to immigrate to this great country. They came here because there was no limit to upward mobility; they came to the United States because it was the land of milk and honey; because they knew that here, their children would live better lives than they lived; that there was no limit to what anybody with determination and the lucky break of being an American could accomplish. Mike and I have lived out our parents’ dream. There is no reason why any American child today should not have that same opportunity.\n\nIf the American dream is to survive, we will need to re-create a fiscal and regulatory environment that—in conjunction with the Fed conducting prudent monetary policy—will liberate the forces of entrepreneurial risk taking that have always been America’s hallmark, and that allowed successor generations to live far better lives than their parents ever thought possible. Only then will we get back to generating the jobs and the prosperity for all of our people, not just for financial sharpies. Only then will we restore faith in the prospect of upward mobility for all, not just the few. And only then, with the nation’s economy firmly back on a trajectory of promise and prosperity, will we feel “braced” with confidence that no force can dislodge by sneaking up behind us with a proverbial lead pipe.\n\nBobby, I thank you and this wonderful audience for your time. Now, in the best tradition of central banking, I would be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

        "content": "November 15, 2011 New York City\n\nIt is bracing to be with bright, young students here at the Politics and Business Club of Columbia University. I understand I have a high bar today: I need to surmount the heights reached in the insightful lecture recently given your undergraduate students by Vinny Guadagnino from the show Jersey Shore. I’ll do my best.\n\nExecutive Summary\nToday, I will speak to the issue of depository institutions considered “too big to fail” and “systemically important.” I will argue that, just as health authorities in the United States are waging a campaign against the plague of obesity, banking regulators must do the same with regard to oversized banks that undermine the nation’s financial health and are a potential threat to economic stability. I shall speak of the difficulty of treating this pernicious problem in a culture held hostage by concerns for “contagion,” “systemic risk” and “unique solutions.” I will posit that preoccupation with these concerns leads to an ethic that coddles survival of the fattest rather than promoting survival of the fittest, to the detriment of social welfare and economic efficiency.[1] I will express my hope that, properly implemented, the capstone of financial oversight, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd–Frank), might assist in reining in the pernicious threat to financial stability that megabanks or “systemically important financial institutions”—the SIFIs—have become. But I will also express concern about the difficulty of doing so, concluding with a suggestion that perhaps the financial equivalent of irreversible lap-band or gastric bypass surgery is the only way to treat the pathology of financial obesity, contain the relentless expansion of these banks and downsize them to manageable proportions.\n\nThe Problem with SIFIs\nAspiring politicians in this audience do not have to be part of the Occupy Wall Street movement, or be advocates for the Tea Party, to recognize that government-assisted bailouts of reckless financial institutions are sociologically and politically offensive; they stand the concept of American social justice on its head. Business school students here will understand that bailouts of errant banks are questionable from the standpoint of the efficient workings of capitalism, for they run the risk of institutionalizing a practice that distorts the discipline of the marketplace and interferes with the transmission of monetary policy.\n\nTo this last point, my colleague and director of research at the Dallas Fed, Harvey Rosenblum, and I have written about how too-big-to-fail banks disrupt the transmission of policy initiatives. I refer you to the article we jointly authored for the Wall Street Journal in September 2009, titled “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy.” Our thesis was that as their losses mounted, the too-big-to-fails, or SIFIs, were forced to cut back their lending and gummed up the nation’s capital markets in general. Thus, before the Dodd–Frank Act was even proposed, we wrote that “guarding against a resurgence of the omnivorous TBTF Blob [must] be among the goals of financial reform.”[2]\n\nIn previous speeches I have taken note of another dimension to the problem of sustaining behemoth financial institutions, and that is the cost of doing so. Andrew Haldane, executive director for financial stability and a member of the Financial Policy Committee at the Bank of England, provides some rough estimates of the subsidy that flows to banks from governments following a too-big-to-fail policy. With markets working under the assumption that they will invariably be protected by government, the cost of funds is measurably less, according to Haldane’s work, giving them preferential access to investment capital. He estimates the global subsidies enjoyed by the too-big-to-fails in 2009 ranged up to a staggering $2.3 trillion.[3]\n\nThus, I argue that sustaining too-big-to-fail-ism and maintaining the cocoon of protection of SIFIs is counterproductive, expensive and socially questionable.\n\nAs students, you should know that financial booms and busts are a recurring theme throughout history and that bankers and their regulators suffer from recurring amnesia. They periodically forget the past and all the lessons of history, tuck into some new financial, quick-profit fantasy—like the slicing and dicing and packaging of mortgage financing—and underestimate the risk of growing into unmanageable and unsustainable size, scale and complexity as they overindulge in that new financial fantasy. Invariably, these behemoth institutions use their size, scale and complexity to cow politicians and regulators into believing the world will be placed in peril should they attempt to discipline them. They argue that disciplining them will be a trip wire for financial contagion, market disruption and economic disorder. Yet failing to discipline them only delays the inevitable—a bursting of a bubble and a financial panic that places the economy in peril. This phenomenon most recently manifested itself in the Panic of 2008 and 2009.\n\nPaul Volcker states the problem thus: “The greatest structural challenge facing the financial system is how to deal with the widespread impression—many would say conviction—that important institutions are deemed ‘too large or too interconnected’ to fail.”[4]\n\nPaul ‘Moses’ and John Milton\nOn previous occasions, I have referred to Paul Volcker as the Moses of central bankers. He is an iconic figure who led us out of the desert of inflation and economic stagnation in the 1980s. Mr. Volcker is a man of principle and probity; is selfless and indifferent to financial gain; and is wise to the political shenanigans of powerful lobbies that perpetuate structural distortions that interfere with the public good. (In short, he is the perfect stuff of a central banker.) Most importantly, he understands the necessity of allowing for failure as a part of the process of creative destruction, especially so in the world of finance.\n\nHaving referred to Moses, I trust that in this academic setting, I might be forgiven if I draw upon one of my favorite literary references to failure, albeit one that is other-worldly. In Paradise Lost, John Milton has God telling us why he created men and angels, both of whom could betray Him:\n\nMilton considered the issue of failure on a much higher plane than the realm of bank regulatory policy. But the principle, expressed in that stanza of his paean to God’s creation of the “ethereal Powers,” applies equally to banking. Banks are created and given powers as mechanisms of credit intermediation, in order to allow an economy to grow and become prosperous. Yet, if regulators—who oversee the creation of banks and monitor their business—can’t secure capital structures at our largest financial institutions that are “just and right,” and do not allow for institutions that “betray” their creators to be “free to fall,” it is unlikely those financial institutions will fulfill their proper intermediary role and be agents of economic prosperity.\n\nThus far, regulators have failed in their mission of warding off betrayal.\n\nPerpetuating Obesity\nWith each passing year, the banking industry has become more concentrated. Half of the entire banking industry’s assets are now on the books of five institutions. Their combined assets presently equate to roughly 58 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). The combined assets of the 10 largest depository institutions equate to 65 percent of the banking industry’s assets and 75 percent of our GDP.\n\nSome of this ongoing consolidation is the result of a dynamic set in place by Congress’ passage of interstate branching legislation in 1994 and repeal of Glass–Steagall provisions in 1999. But some of it also reflects the result of the recent financial crisis. When difficulties began to appear at large financial institutions, resolution policies often entailed their merger or acquisition with other large institutions. Add to this the regulatory forbearance and financial backstops that tend to be granted to the largest banks in exigent circumstances, and the end result is a few financial behemoths, each with well over a trillion dollars in assets and a heavy concentration of power. In fact, the top three U.S. bank holding companies each presently have assets of roughly $2 trillion or more.\n\nOf course, problems in the banking sector have not been exclusively confined to large financial institutions. Regional and community banks have faced their own problems, especially connected to construction lending. But here is the rub: When smaller banks get in trouble, regulators step in and resolve them. The term “resolve” in the context of smaller banks is a fancy way of saying their demise was quickly and nondisruptively arranged—they were disposed of. We might have expected equal treatment of big banks, but, of course, that did not happen.6 To be sure, some very large financial firms have ceased to exist or have been through a corporate reorganization with some of the characteristics of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But these institutions deemed “too big to fail,” and deemed to be “systemically” important due to their size and complexity, were given preferential treatment. Many were absorbed by still larger financial institutions, thus perpetuating and exacerbating the phenomenon of too big to fail.\n\nThis problem of supersized and hypercomplex banks is not unique to the United States. Europe is struggling today with how to cushion its megabanks from excessive exposure to intra-European sovereign debt. And Japan is still feeling the negative impacts of not successfully resolving the financial difficulties at its megabanks two decades ago.\n\nA Perverse Lake Wobegon\nWhy are too-big-to-fail institutions treated differently than smaller banks? Even Vinny Guadagnino knows the obvious answer to that question: In a system of large and/or interconnected banks, difficulties at one institution can easily spill over and take down other banks or even the entire industry. Fear of “systemic risk” conditions the treatment of financial behemoths.\n\nIn today’s interconnected, globalized financial system, systemic risk is more pronounced than ever. And we know that when a systemic crisis occurs—as it did in the Panic of 2008–09—the results can be catastrophic to the economy. Small wonder that in commenting on the problems currently besetting Europe, the U.S. Treasury secretary recently stated, “The threat of cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic risk must be taken off the table.”[7] This has become dogma among banking regulators and their minders. Thus, in the recently announced Greek bond deal, the Euro Summit Statement tells us that “Greece requires an exceptional and unique solution.”[8]\n\nSuch a solution is certainly in the interest of American bankers. In Saturday’s New York Times, it was reported that the Congressional Research Service has estimated that the exposure of U.S. banks to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain amounted to $641 billion; American banks’ exposure to German and French banks was in excess of an additional $1.2 trillion. According to the Bank for International Settlements, U.S. banks have $757 billion in derivative contracts and $650 billion in credit commitments from European banks. Thus, the Congressional Research Service concluded that “a collapse of a major European bank could produce similar problems in U.S. institutions.”[9]\n\nIn the land of the too-big-to-fails, we find ourselves in something akin to a perverse financial Lake Wobegon: All crises are “exceptional,” and all require “unique solution(s).”\n\nYet, it seems to me that in our desire to avoid “cascading default” and “catastrophic risk,” and in our search for “exceptional and unique solution(s),” we may well be compounding systemic risk rather than solving it. By seeking to postpone the comeuppance of investors, lenders and bank managers who made imprudent decisions, we incur the wrath of ordinary citizens and smaller entities that resent this favorable treatment, and we plant the seeds of social unrest. We also impede the ability of the market to clear or, to paraphrase Milton, allow the marketplace to distinguish “freely” those who should stand and those who should fall.\n\nEnter Dodd–Frank\nI said earlier that financial crises are nothing new. Nor is the response to them: a flurry of legislation that ends up giving more power to regulators in the hope of preventing the next crisis. The Glass–Steagall Act was enacted during the Great Depression, the FDIC Improvement Act after the banking and savings-and-loan troubles in the late 1980s. And now, in response to the Panic of 2008–09, we are implementing the Dodd–Frank Act.\n\nDodd–Frank—which is over 2,000 pages long, contains 16 titles, 38 subtitles and a total of 541 sections—is the most complex document ever written in the history of efforts to change the financial regulatory landscape. A cheeky historian might recall French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau’s reaction to Woodrow Wilson’s 14 points, proposed as a safeguard for world peace after World War I: Clemenceau is reported to have thought that God did a pretty good job with only 10.\n\nWhether it is through 10 commandments or 14 points, or over 2,000 pages, the question is: Does Dodd–Frank appropriately confront systemic risk and the associated problem of too big to fail? Its preamble certainly states a desire to do so, declaring boldly that its purpose is to “end ‘too big to fail’” and “protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts.”[10]\n\nDodd–Frank does, in fact, contain a number of measures that attempt to address too-big-to-fail-ism. It creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council—or FSOC—composed of the major financial-sector regulators charged with overseeing the entire financial system. The FSOC can recommend that important nonbank firms be brought under the regulatory umbrella. Those who will be brought under that umbrella will be subjected to periodic stress tests to make sure they can withstand reversals in the economy and other adverse developments. Dodd–Frank calls for enhanced capital requirements for SIFIs. And it provides for a new authority for resolving bank holding companies and other financial institutions that wasn’t available to authorities during the recent crisis.\n\nImplementing Dodd–Frank\nWill it work? Will Dodd–Frank achieve the desired goals declared in its preamble? The devil, as always, is in the details of how the legislation is implemented.\n\nAt the most basic level, the legislation leaves many of the details to rulemakings by various regulatory agencies; more than one year after enactment, there is still much work to be done in actually implementing the act. On Nov. 1, the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell released its monthly progress report on Dodd–Frank implementation. According to that report, of the 400 rulings required by the legislation, 173, or roughly 43 percent, have not yet been proposed by regulators. Of the 141 rulemakings required of bank regulators—the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currencey—58, or about 41 percent, have not yet been proposed.[11]\n\nCapital Requirements and an Atomic Reaction\nWhile acknowledging that the specific regulations spawned by Dodd–Frank have yet to be perfected, one of the harshest criticisms of its treatment of SIFIs has come from my former colleague and president of the Kansas City Fed, Tom Hoenig, who is now the nominee to be vice chair of the FDIC. He has argued that the very existence of SIFIs is “fundamentally inconsistent with capitalism” and “inherently destabilizing to global markets and detrimental to world growth.”[12] Moreover, according to Mr. Hoenig—who had unquestionably the greatest depth of regulatory experience of all the Federal Reserve presidents and governors—even with the completion of Dodd–Frank, the existence of too-big-to-fail institutions will likely remain and “poses the greatest risk to the U.S. economy.”[13]\n\nOne might counter that the enhanced capital requirements envisioned by Dodd–Frank—being negotiated presently by the Fed and other regulators nationally and internationally—will be a fitting treatment for too-big-to-fail-ism. In theory, it certainly sounds good. But as Paul Volcker has pointed out, “That’s an old story.”[14] We’ve had a system of international risk-based capital requirements in place for some time under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements, beginning with Basel I in the early 1990s. That morphed into Basel II in the early 2000s, and now we are introducing Basel III. In fact, in the U.S., we can go all the way back to the National Bank Act of 1864 to find a system of capital requirements on banks.\n\nCapital requirements are indeed important. A strong capital base protects a business when times get tough, giving it reserves to draw upon so that it can wait out a storm. Applied to banks, it also should mitigate risk-taking incentives that are an inevitable by-product of our too-big-to-fail system: If you put meaningful shareholder money directly at risk, managers of banks beholden to those shareholders will be less tempted to take pie-eyed risks.[15]\n\nThe operative word in the previous sentence is “meaningful.” The existing regulatory measures were found wanting on measures of meaningful capital. For example, at the height of the crisis in mid-2008, two of the largest, most troubled institutions—Citigroup and Bank of America—were considered “adequately capitalized” (or even higher), according to the then-prevailing regulatory criteria. The Belgian bank Dexia is another case in point. In a press release issued just last May, it highlighted its regulatory capital ratio of 13.4 percent as “confirming our Group’s high level of solvency.”[16]\n\nWinston Churchill used the phrase “terminological inexactitude” to suggest a certain lack of directness; one might easily conclude that there was some “inexactitude” surrounding the capital structures of Citi, Bank of America and Dexia.\n\nI return to Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England. Haldane makes an intriguing parallel between the financial system and epidemiological networks. Conventional capital requirements seek to equalize failure probabilities across institutions to a certain threshold, say 0.1 percent. But using a systemwide approach would result in a different calibration, if the objective were to set a firm’s capital requirements equal to the marginal cost of its failure to the system as a whole. Regulatory capital requirements would then be higher for banks posing the greatest risk to the system, which is what Dodd–Frank proposes, and what the current Basel III requirements are also considering.\n\nTo Haldane, this is a new approach in banking, but not in epidemiology where “focusing preventive action on ‘super-spreaders’ within the network to limit the potential for systemwide spread” is the norm. As Haldane emphasizes, “If anything, this same logic applies with even greater force in banking.”[17] To me, treating too-big-to-fail institutions as potential “super-spreaders” of financial germs has a great deal of appeal.\n\nThe latest round of international capital standards is seeking to correct for “terminological inexactitude” and tighten up the definition of what banks can count as capital, so as to prevent “super-spreading.” That’s good news. Yet, this effort is being met with fierce resistance from the SIFIs. Tom Hoenig once suggested that when regulators begin the process of tightening up the latitude granted the megabanks, they will find themselves “facing an atomic force of resistance.”[18] He appears to have been spot on. The head of one of the major U.S. financial institutions has called these new proposals “anti-American.”[19] Last Thursday, the Wall Street Journal wrote of “bankers seething over rising … capital requirements.”[20] Such is the intensity of emotion to resist the work of the Fed and other regulators as they seek to protect the system from the pernicious risk inherent in the existence of megabanks.\n\nWe cannot let that resistance prevail.\n\nAnd we must insist, as Dodd–Frank does, that SIFIs be required to submit a “living will” that describes their orderly demise. Credit exposure reports must also be submitted periodically to estimate the extent of SIFI interconnectedness. We must see to it that the FDIC “ensure(s) that the shareholders of a covered financial company … not receive payment until after all other claims … are fully paid.”[21] This is essential to restoring the discipline of the marketplace and is what the Fed expects to achieve when it finalizes its work on Section 165 and other aspects of the legislation, as discussed last week by Vice Chair Janet Yellen in a speech in Chicago.[22]\n\nAn Achilles' Heel\nFor all that it specifies to treat the unhealthy obesity and complexity of too-big-to-fails, Dodd–Frank has an Achilles' heel. It states that in the disposition of assets, the FDIC shall “to the greatest extent practicable, conduct its operations in a manner that … mitigates the potential for serious adverse effects to the financial system.”[23] This is entirely desirable; nobody wants to initiate serious financial disruption. But directing the FDIC to mitigate the potential for serious adverse effects leaves plenty of wiggle room for fears of “cascading defaults” and “catastrophic risk” to perpetuate “exceptional and unique” treatments, should push again come to shove.\n\nI may be excessively skeptical on this front. Vigilantes of the bond and stock market, of which I was once a part, have been demanding greater transparency in reporting the exposures of the megabanks, including a more fulsome account of both gross and net exposures of credit default swaps. And Moody’s has recently downgraded the long-term debt of major U.S. and U.K. banks. This is oddly reassuring. Moody’s said that “actions already taken by U.K. authorities have significantly reduced the predictability of support over the medium to long term,”[24] whereas in the U.S., it found “a decrease in the probability that the U.S. government would support [major banks].”[25]\n\nOf course, the ratings agencies did not exactly cover themselves in glory during the crisis. Let’s hope their assessment of at least somewhat more limited government support for the megabanks proves more accurate than the triple-A ratings they gave to so many mortgage-backed securities.\n\nThe Alternative: Radical Surgery\nIn short, progress is being made in the direction of treating the pathology of SIFIs and the detailing of enhanced prudential standards governing their behavior. Yet, in my view, there is only one fail-safe way to deal with too big to fail. I believe that too-big-to-fail banks are too-dangerous-to-permit.[26] As Mervyn King, head of the Bank of England, once said, “If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then … they are too big.” I favor an international accord that would break up these institutions into more manageable size. More manageable not only for regulators, but also for the executives of these institutions. For there is scant chance that managers of $1 trillion or $2 trillion banking enterprises can possibly “know their customer,” follow time-honored principles of banking and fashion reliable risk management models for organizations as complex as these megabanks have become.\n\nAm I too radical? I think not. I find myself in good company—Paul Volcker, for example, advocates “reducing their size, curtailing their interconnectedness, or limiting their activities.”[27]\n\nIn my view, downsizing the behemoths over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders is the appropriate policy response. Then, creative destruction can work its wonders in the financial sector, just as it does elsewhere in our economy.\n\nWe shouldn’t just pay lip service to letting the discipline of the market work. Ideally, we should rely on market forces to work not only in good times, but also in times of difficulties. Ultimately, we should move to end too big to fail and the apparatus of bailouts and do so well before bankers lose their memory of the recent crisis and embark on another round of excessive risk taking. Only then will we have a financial system fit and proper for servicing an economy as dynamic as that of the United States.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "November 2, 2011 New York City\n\nThis is an important evening. We gather under the name of Frédéric Bastiat to celebrate those who write about free markets, a concept that for many of today’s foremost economic policy pundits is as provocative as a Texan evoking the virtues of a Frenchman.\n\nBastiat would no doubt be pleased that this most famous of dining rooms is not lit by candlelight, but by the agent of creative destruction that is electricity. Of course, the term “creative destruction” is Joseph Schumpeter’s, not Bastiat’s. Like Bastiat, Schumpeter was an eccentric. Having immigrated to America and to Harvard, Schumpeter was said to introduce himself to his first class by saying he wished to be considered “the greatest economist in the world, the greatest horseman in Austria and the best lover in Vienna.” To which he quickly added, “I never became the greatest horseman in Austria.” Schumpeter was impossibly vain, but discerning. It is no small thing that he described Bastiat as “the most brilliant economic journalist who ever lived.”[1]\n\nIn July, Jim Grant wrote a fine piece on Bastiat for the Wall Street Journal, titled “For Love of Laissez-Faire,” reviewing an English-language collection of Bastiat’s letters titled The Man and the Statesman. Grant quotes Bastiat as praising the qualities of readable literature as follows: “It has to be short, clear, accurate and as full of feeling as of ideas, all at the same time.”[2] You might be aghast at my quoting Keynes as having suggested what I think might be a good addendum to Bastiat’s literary advice: “Words ought to be a little wild, for they are the assault of thoughts upon the unthinking.”[3]\n\nTonight, we celebrate a small coterie of women and men who write “short, clear, accurate” articles that are “full of feeling” for the idea of free markets and, if not necessarily wild, do, in fact, frontally assault run-of-the-mill thinking.\n\nTonight, we celebrate not just free markets, but freedom itself. Freedom to express thought. Freedom to challenge convention. Freedom to be heard and to be seen and felt doing so.\n\n“The cause of freedom is not the cause of a race or a sect, a party or a class—it is the cause of human kind, the very birthright of humanity.”[4] Anna Julia Cooper, the daughter of a slave and one of the first African-American women to earn a doctorate—at the University of Paris, no less—said that.\n\n“Don’t wink at a girl in the dark.” My father said that.\n\nAmity was kind to mention my dad and what he overcame. Like Bastiat, my father was orphaned at a young age—at the age of 6. Unlike Bastiat, he did not inherit an estate in Mugron. In fact, until he was picked up by local magistrates in Queensland, he and his father, my grandfather, begged for food on the streets in the aftermath of the depression that gripped Australia at the turn of the previous century. Unlike Ms. Cooper, he never received an education. He barely made it through fourth grade; he certainly did not get a formal education in economics. Yet, like Ms. Cooper, he understood the romance and power of freedom. And he understood what Bastiat taught us all: He understood an idea that is “full of feeling,” unseen or improperly communicated, is the equivalent of the proverbial tree that falls in the forest. He could not have spelled it, but he instinctively understood the meaning of praxeology; his quip about winking is as good as any to remind economists of the need to understand the basics of human action and reaction when they ply their models and their prescriptions for what ails us.\n\nThe nice things that Amity said about me were all made possible because my father and mother came to America. Because they believed that here, more than anywhere else, human endeavor was prized, and that here, freedom was and is the “birthright of humanity.” Having been a ward of the state, my father taught his son—me—that individual effort is the sole proven basis for advancement; that dependence on government, which he managed to escape, is just another word for entrapment and, however well intentioned, severely regressive.\n\nMost everyone in this room tonight is concerned that, as Bastiat wrote in the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1848, we are at risk of becoming a nation where “the state is responsible for providing a living for everyone.”[5] The reality is that even if this were desirable, which it is not, pliant fiscal authorities—Republican and Democrat—who have led us down this road for decades find themselves in a financial cul de sac; they have run out of enabling money.\n\nOf course, they could skip the curb and keep on moving in the same direction were the central bank to accommodate them by monetizing their debts. But we all know that ends ultimately in the most ruinous of scenarios, the onset of hyperinflation. It is a far better thing for them to face up to the fact that they have been improvident and must now change their ways—that they must not, and cannot, hide under the skirts of the Federal Reserve. The central bank must never become an accomplice to feckless government. Indeed, as we at the Fed and central banks worldwide are guardians of a fiat currency—a faith-based currency—it is imperative that we never, ever, ever, be seen to have the slightest inclination to countenance doing so. For that fragile faith, once violated, can never be restored.\n\nTo be fair, our politicians develop their initiatives according to what gets them elected and reelected. This is how a democracy works. Those of us who cherish freedom know that democracy is freedom’s great enabler. Thus, it is incumbent upon all of us to provide the people with the information they need to make informed judgments, not in obscure math published in elite journals, but in plain language they understand, disseminated through media they can readily access.\n\nThe awardees tonight do all of us one better: They strip bare the hypocrisy of the nanny state, see through the veil of differential calculus and complex formulae that modern economists have come to rely upon, and in the very best tradition of Bastiat and his disciples, appeal to logic to expose the unintended consequences and longer-term effects of popular policy prescriptions. They do so in readable form that would do Bastiat proud: They wink in the brightest of daylight, communicating their passion for free markets for all to see. Tonight, we honor their courage. We applaud the strength of their conviction and obstinacy in sticking to their principles. And not unimportantly—thanks to Tom Smith, Pamela Hoiles, Charles Kadlec, Jim Piereson and others—we reward them with generous prizes so that they will keep on doing what they do so well: Articulating the virtues of free and open markets.\n\nAfter dinner—and what I am certain will be a far more entertaining speech than this one, by Professor [Russ] Roberts—this year’s Hoiles Prize and Bastiat Prize will be presented. I was honored to be a judge for the latter. I learned something from each of the articles I read from each of the six worthy Bastiat Prize finalists. You are all bright, shining stars. Yet, Amity, being the discreet task master and master of surprise that she is, has not even revealed the winner to the judges. I am eager to find out. So in my best Texan imitation of what I am sure was the most frequent of all of Bastiat’s exhortations: À table et place au spectacle. Let’s eat and get on with the show. Mille fois merci.",

        "content": "October 21, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nIt has been decades since I was an active member of this prestigious forum. Last night, I attended a book party for Kathryn McGarr, Cappy McGarr and Janie Strauss McGarr’s daughter. She has written a zinger of a book about her mother’s uncle, Bob Strauss, one of our most accomplished and colorful public servants.[1]\n\nThe evening brought to mind the time—I believe it was in 1979 or thereabouts—when Bob was U.S. trade representative and spoke to the Friday Group. He was introduced by his brother Ted, who gave such an admiring and thorough background introduction that it went on longer than Bob had time to speak. When Bob finally stood up to the podium, right off the bat he was vintage Strauss: “G-- d---it Ted, I asked for an introduction, not a G-- d---ed travelogue!” (And it wasn’t “Gosh darned.”)\n\nEven if I had the temerity to speak like Bob Strauss, I’d have no need to do so today. That was a nice, short intro, Mark [Sinclair]. Thank you.\n\nLeaders at the Dallas Fed\n\nBefore getting into the substance of my talk, I am going to let you in on a little secret. As mentioned, I am, indeed, the CEO of a $110 billion bank, the largest in Texas, the ultimate banker’s Bank of this region. But while CEOs get all the credit for running a business, the truth is they are only as good as the people they have operating their business. With me today are some of the key operators of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; I want to single them out:\n\nHelen Holcomb is my chief operating officer and chair of our senior management committee. Helen operates the Bank with remarkable efficiency and is a person of wise and insightful judgment. I do not do a thing without first consulting Helen.\n\nMeredith Black wears two hats as our chief financial officer and chief information officer. Meredith plays a key role in management of the Federal Reserve System’s information technology, on which we spend over $1 billion a year.\n\nJoanna Kolson is our senior vice president in charge of cash operations. About $105 billion in Federal Reserve notes—ones and twos, fives and tens, twenties and fifties and one-hundred-dollar bills—passed through our vaults last year. Joanna is known as the “keeper of the vault,” in addition to overseeing the management of all of our facilities.\n\nAnn Worthy runs our lending operations—we lent over $30 billion to banks in Texas during the financial crisis in 2009 to assist them with their operating needs. Ann’s keen eye made sure we were paid everything back, and at a profit.\n\nAnd Mine Yücel is our senior economist. Mine was born and educated in Turkey and received her PhD from Rice. She is the Dallas Fed’s leading expert on our region and also a renowned energy economist, serving as president of the International Association of Energy Economics.\n\nEach of you has the image of a Federal Reserve note—what you call a dollar bill—at your seat. In the middle of the left side of that note is the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve Texas;” the inner circle reads “Bank of Dallas.” K is the 11th letter in the alphabet; the number 11 is printed in each of the four corners of the bill. There are 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all founded in 1913; the Dallas Fed and its branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso constitute the Eleventh Federal Reserve District, serving some 27 million people over an expanse of 360,000 square miles and with economic output that exceeds that of Australia and only recently fell behind that of India. (I like to tease my colleagues at the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks that our “Dallas dollars” represent greater nominal value than all the rest.)\n\nI am blessed to serve as the president and CEO of the Dallas Fed. But in reality, I am just a pretty face; the muscle and brains of the Dallas Fed are these brilliant women and the men and women they work with and lead. Please join me in thanking them for what they do.\n\n‘Help Me Out’\n\nLast week, I was in Washington. I had breakfast with a wise and worldly old friend from my days as a trade negotiator for the United States—Mike Moore, the former prime minister of New Zealand and director-general of the World Trade Organization who is now New Zealand’s ambassador to Washington. Ambassador Moore’s perspectives are different from mine; I always find them thought-provoking. The ambassador is blessed with a keen mind and the ability to deploy a pungent sense of humor, usually wrapped in a memorable analogy, in order to convey a serious message. He told me the story of a God-fearing man who prayed several times a day, imploring the Lord to let him win the lottery. Day after day, year after year, God listened to this man. Finally, He grew weary of the man’s prayers and spoke to him: “Help me out, my son, so that I might help you,” the Lord said. “Buy a ticket!”\n\nThis afternoon, I am going to make reference to the Federal Reserve and the job of a central banker. This is what I do for a living, and it has become reflexive for me to explain my, and my colleagues’, calling. Mark has asked me to broaden my theme today, however, and I am going to do just that: I am going to suggest that our nation has a crying need for public leadership to correct what is wrong with our economy; that the Federal Reserve has provided the leadership required of it; that monetary policy cannot do it alone and must be complemented by responsible fiscal policy—policy that is exclusively the responsibility of those whom we elect to represent us in Washington; that rather than posturing for political expediency and positioning for victory at the polls in November 2012, our nation’s political leaders need to actually “buy a ticket” and put themselves at risk, right now and without delay. Each passing day they fail to do so further jeopardizes our economic stability and our nation’s future.\n\nUnemployment Is THE Issue\n\nOur great country now finds itself in a very difficult economic predicament. It is true that the situation here in Texas is relatively better than that of the nation; Texas is an oasis in a national economic desert devoid of life-giving job creation. We went into the Great Recession last and were one of the first to come out. As we have for the past 40 years, we continue to outpace the rest of the United States in employment growth by a significant margin. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, only North Dakota (a plucky state whose population is less than that of Collin or Denton counties) has seen faster job growth than Texas.\n\nAs I speak, Texas has almost as many people employed as we did before the recession began. Our banks are in better shape than those in the rest of the country. We are benefiting from the blessings of nature, with copious amounts of oil and gas and abundant agricultural production. Our fellow citizens have seen to it that our Legislature continues to hew to a tax, regulatory and legal environment that attracts job-creating investment and encourages business formation and growth.\n\nAnd yet, even in this blessed state, there are too many unemployed and underemployed, just as there are in the rest of America. We can do better. America must do better.\n\nThe question is: How?\n\nTo create employment, we must have economic growth.\n\nThe simplest of econometric equations posits that the key components of economic growth are: domestic consumption, plus foreign demand for U.S.-produced exports, plus investment by businesses, plus spending by government.\n\nI think it is pretty clear to everyone who lives on the planet that in order to expand our economy and put our people back to work, we must rely on our ability to curry to domestic and foreign consumption and invest here at home to produce the goods and services to sell into the marketplace here and abroad. You’d have to be from Mars to believe that our financially strapped federal and state governments will be the source of much direct spending stimulus to the economy going forward.\n\nAesop’s Fable\n\nPresently, all eyes are focused on the ongoing budget deliberations in Washington. During the summer debt-ceiling negotiations, I was reminded of Aesop’s classic fable. Rather than work like ants to build and store for difficult times, our fiscal authorities—Congress after Congress, under Republican and Democrat leadership alike, and with presidents of both parties occupying the White House—have been proverbial grasshoppers. Except for a few interludes, they have partied along for decades using the people’s money as though life were an endless summer, storing nothing to draw upon for the blustery fall and the bleak winter that inevitably follow. Now a fiscal reckoning is upon us. The gig is up. Congress can no longer carry on as before, oblivious to the deleterious effect of spending our, and the successor generations’, money with unfunded abandon.\n\nTongues firmly in cheek, clever pundits have reminded us that there are alternative versions of this fable. In 1924, Somerset Maugham wrote a version about two brothers: one an ant-like hard worker and the other a grasshopper wastrel. In the end, the grasshopper marries a rich widow, who dies and leaves him a fortune.[2] Case closed! In Things Change, a film released by Columbia Pictures in 1988, the character played by Don Ameche recites a version in which the grasshopper, fed up with all this moralizing about the virtues of hard work and saving for a rainy day, just up and eats the ants.\n\nI think we can safely assume that neither of these scenarios will occur. No one is going to bail out our federal government at the last minute; there is no rich-widow equivalent for rescuing fiscal spendthrifts. The ants that are the hardworking taxpayers are, if anything, poised to chew up and spit out improvident politicians should they fail to put an end to fiscal profligacy. The fiscal authorities have no choice but to come to terms with the need to bring about a better balance between taxes and spending and to not only bend the curve, but also reverse the inexorable growth in federal debt accumulation. This is the stuff of the great negotiations taking place in Washington.\n\nNo Small Chore\n\nThis is no small chore. The parties involved must stop the hemorrhaging without inducing cardiac arrest; they must solve the long-run debt and deficit problem without, in the short run, pushing the economy back into recession, creating still more unemployment. And they not only must confront their addiction to debt and spending beyond their means, but also reorganize the tax system, redirect the money they spend and rewrite the regulations they create so as to be competitive in a world that wants to beat us at our own game.\n\nThis is an essential point. My wife, Nancy, is in Vietnam as we speak. Imagine that! When she and I were in college, we were at war, killing the Vietnamese. And they were killing us, including my close friend and high school football teammate, Greg Lavery, who was shot dead by a Vietcong sniper as he patrolled a rice paddy in 1968. Today, my wife is free to walk unafraid across a rice paddy or through the streets of Saigon and Hanoi. American companies trade and invest in Vietnam, and Vietnamese companies do so here. This is good news! We won the Cold War. Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong and all the brutal dictators who ruled the Soviet Union are long gone. In the blink of history’s eye, we have gone from mutually assured destruction on the battlefield to mutually reinforcing competition in the marketplace. This is what we spent an entire generation of American blood and treasure to achieve, and it is a far better thing.\n\nThe consequence, however, is that we are now being challenged as the place to invest job-creating capital by the Vietnamese, the Chinese, the Indians and countless others who have decided to engage full bore in the commercial interplay of a global economy. Our business operators are obligated by their shareholders and their creditors to earn a return on investment and maximize profit; we live in a globalized, interconnected world, and money is free to go to wherever it earns the best return. The point is that our fiscal and regulatory authorities do not operate in a vacuum. It will not be enough to reach a real deal on the debt ceiling or on reining in deficits. In the post-Cold War, post-Bamboo Curtain world, there are many governments and great swathes of people outside the United States that want to attract investment and improve their lot.\n\nIn crafting a solution to the nation’s fiscal crisis, our political leaders must take this new reality into account and develop an entirely new structure of incentives for private businesses and investors to put their money to work creating jobs, here at home rather than abroad.\n\nOnly fiscal authorities have the power to affect this outcome. Monetary authorities, like me and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve, have limited influence. We can fill the gas tank with attractively priced fuel—abundant and cheap money—needed to propel the economy. But we cannot trigger the impulse to step on the pedal and engage the transmission mechanism of job-creating investment by the private sector. This is the province of those who write our laws and regulations—the Congress of the United States.\n\nThe Limits of Monetary Policy\n\nI happen to believe that the Federal Reserve is exhausting the limits of prudent monetary policy. The programs popularly known as QE2 and Operation Twist are, to my way of thinking, of doubtful efficacy, which is why I have not been able to support them. I suspect that, at least in the case of Operation Twist, they have so far been of greater benefit to traders and large monied interests than to job-creating businesses. But even if you believe, as the majority of my learned colleagues do, that the benefits of QE2 and Operation Twist outweigh their costs, you would be hard-pressed to now say that still more liquidity, or more fuel, is called for given the $1.5 trillion in excess bank reserves and the substantial liquid holdings businesses are hoarding above their normal working-capital needs.\n\nEven surveys of small businesses—for example, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s survey of companies with less than $25 million in sales and fewer than 500 employees conducted in July, or the National Federation of Independent Business survey of September—indicate that fewer than 10 percent of small enterprises (which employ half of the private sector’s workers) are having problems accessing credit.[3]\n\nI would submit that adding more liquidity, or making money still cheaper, is not the answer to our problems.\n\nEconomic Forecast—Caveat Emptor\n\nWith monetary policy having broached what I consider to be the limits of accommodation, and the federal government at sixes and sevens, what then is the economic outlook? Are we going to grow through the rest of the year and on into the next, or are we going to dip back into recession?\n\nForecasting economic growth is not a precise business. Economics is an art form, not a science; it is very judgmental and subjective. The FOMC is composed of 17 thoughtful, introspective and deliberate men and women. Five of the members who serve full time are in Washington as governors of the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by presidents of the United States with the approval of Congress. The remaining 12, like me, are presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks, chosen by nine-member, nonpolitical boards of directors of citizens in their districts and charged with conducting the business of the Fed in the field based on our acumen and with developing policy insights based upon what we see, hear and measure on Main Street. Together, the 17 of us formulate policy with the best judgment we can collectively muster, focused on what is in the best long-term interest of the country’s economy. This is critical for the nation: Your central bank must remain independent of political influence, free from political pressures or the passions of the moment.\n\nWithin the FOMC, we each develop forecasts for the economy. To provide those forecasts, we employ sophisticated econometric models, study the entrails of numerous comprehensive surveys conducted all across the nation—like the Dallas Fed’s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey and the Texas Retail Outlook Survey (developed under the watchful eye of Mine Yücel), and counterpart surveys conducted by other Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors—and draw upon input from our boards of directors, numerous advisory boards and contacts with businesses and stakeholders nationwide and worldwide. These forecasts are helpful guideposts, but they must be kept in context.\n\nKenneth Arrow, a Nobel Laureate in economics, had his own perspective on forecasting. During World War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with a team charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead weather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed statistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The corps’ weather forecasts were no more useful than random rolls of a die. Understandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow’s recollection of his superiors’ response was priceless: “The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.”[4]\n\nKeep Professor Arrow in mind when you hear economists tout precise forecasts carried out several places to the right of the decimal point. You may need economists’ forecasts for planning purposes, but you should always take them with a grain of salt, even when the time horizon is a short one. I direct you to an article in the Feb. 14 edition of the Wall Street Journal as evidence. The Journal had polled 51 leading economists, and they forecast that gross domestic product would expand 3.6 percent in that very same first quarter, ending in less than a month’s time.[5] Growth came in at 1.9 percent.\n\nHeaded in the Right Direction…Slowly\n\nWhen economists forecast we will have growth of, say 3.6 percent, remember they are saying point-zero, three-six. It is an elaborate conceit to think anybody can be that precise in an economy as large as that of the United States, operating as it does within the context of an even larger, very dynamic, global economy. This is true for Fed economists as well as academics and those who sell their forecasts for a living. What matters most to me is the direction in which the numbers are headed and the general sense of momentum.\n\nAt this juncture, I think it sufficient to say that—assuming the people we elect to tax us and spend our money and create the rules and regulations that govern our economic behavior can get their act together, confront their own denial of most rudimentary budgetary discipline, learn to shoot straight and remove the Damocles Sword of uncertainty that they have for too long wielded over our job-creating private sector—there is plenty of potential for confidence to be bolstered and propel the economy forward at an accelerating clip. This is especially the case now that the Fed has reliquified the economy.\n\nWe need not remain stuck in the low gear of the first half of this year. Some of the temporary influences that I believe retarded growth in the first half—high gasoline and unprocessed-food prices, the supply disruptions in Japan, etc.—have passed through the system and are either being reversed or digested. To be sure, some businesses are being hit with higher input costs from imported goods and other nonlabor cost increases. Having become as lean as possible and having learned to preserve their margins by years of tight cost management and by maximizing productivity, they don’t have much fat to absorb the cost of input increases. If input price increases continue or spread, these businesses will naturally attempt to pass them on to consumers, who are wary of anything else that will compress their living standards.\n\nInflation?\n\nBut I see a bit of a tug-of-war developing here. The issue will be whether businesses can exercise pricing power in the face of fallow consumer demand and high unemployment. As an inflation “hawk”—I don’t particularly like that term; I prefer to think of myself and my 16 colleagues, hawks and doves alike, as wise owls, but so be it—I am watching this very carefully. I am aware that the Producer Price Index remains stout and that consumer prices remain sticky at current high levels. If I see inflation continuing to rise and, most important, inflationary expectations beginning to spread, I will be the first out of the box to advocate the removal of the substantial monetary accommodation now in place. I cannot think of anything more damaging to the welfare of hardworking Americans who have jobs, those who are unemployed and barely eking out a living, retirees who are earning minimum returns on their savings, or any consumer already stretched thin, than to have their purchasing power reduced by still-higher inflation. Adding the suffix “flation” to the present stagnation will only result in “stagflation,” the worst of both worlds. This affliction, for example, appears to be taking place in the U.K. and is most vexing for the Bank of England.\n\nPresently, however, I don’t consider stagflation the most likely U.S. outcome. The Dallas Fed has its own measure of inflation. We track the prices of 178 items people actually use—from the cost of gasoline and food to the price paid a hairdresser and to have one’s shoes repaired, the cost of guns and ammunition, beer (my favorite, being the son of an Australian who considered beer one of the basic food groups) and even funerals—in a series we have tracked and updated since 1977. We trim away abnormal monthly squiggles and calculate an underlying trend rate of inflation known as Trimmed Mean Personal Consumption Expenditures. We have found this to be the most accurate forecaster of the direction of inflation.\n\nThe six-month rate of the trimmed mean is 2 percent through August. Thus, we expect the more conventional headline indexes—now running at 3.9 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, and 3 percent, as measured by the last reported personal consumption expenditures index—to gravitate toward the 2 percent level.\n\nJob Creation Is THE Problem\n\nThe problem presently afflicting the nation is not inflation; it is job creation. Our most urgent issue is creating jobs and reducing unemployment. We have too many people out of work and for too long. This is why people have taken to the streets in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and elsewhere in those demonstrations so widely reported in the media. When people are out of work, they get desperate; when masses of people are out of work, you have the recipe for social unrest.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Federal Reserve has filled the tanks with the liquidity, or fuel, needed to create jobs. But only the fiscal authorities—the Congress and the executive branch—can provide the tax, spending and regulatory incentives to induce the private sector to step on the accelerator and engage the transmission of job creation.\n\nEvoking Dr. King\n\nAt the beginning of this talk, I mentioned Ambassador Mike Moore of New Zealand. His most recent book is dedicated “To honorable public servants, elected or otherwise,” as he put it. He then inserts a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. as follows:\n\n“Cowardice asks the question—is it safe? Expediency asks the question—is it politic? Vanity asks the question—is it popular? But conscience asks the question—is it right? … There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular, but one must take it because it is right.”[6]\n\nI would suggest to you that the time is now. Our nation’s economy is at risk. The Federal Reserve is doing everything it can to bolster unemployment without forsaking our sacred commitment to maintaining price stability. I personally don’t care which party is in the White House or controls Congress. All I know is that the “honorable” members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, have conspired over time, however unwittingly, to drive fiscal policy into the ditch. They purchased their elections and reelections with popular programs so poorly funded that they now threaten the economic well-being of our children and our children’s children. Instead of passing the torch on to the successor generation of Americans, the Congress is simply passing them the bill. This is the opposite of honorable, and it must stop.\n\nBack to the Land of Milk and Honey\n\nNow, lest you think I am just another central bank sourpuss, I should tell you that I am actually encouraged that the public—from the Tea Party to the unemployed and disaffected who have taken to the streets—is forcing the politicians to focus on the dire need to get their act together. Indeed, I refuse to yield to pessimism, even as it becomes fashionable to do so. I am the child of immigrants. My parents came to this country because there was no limit to upward mobility; they came to the United States because it was the land of milk and honey. It still is. We just have to re-create a fiscal and regulatory environment that—in conjunction with the Fed conducting prudent monetary policy—will liberate the forces of entrepreneurial risk taking that have always been America’s hallmark. Only then will we get back to generating the jobs and the prosperity for all of our people, not just for financial sharpies. Only then will we restore faith in the prospect of upward mobility for all, not just the few.\n\nAs to the immediate economic outlook, there are a plethora of risks above and beyond the possibility that our politicians will fail to do what is right. They range from possible trip wires that might spring from the fiscal fiasco among the 17 countries in the euro zone to the tempering of growth in many of the emerging markets we sell into. These risks could be the subject of an entire speech. But in surveying that landscape and the risks therein, let me simply say that in the parlance of A.A. Milne, I am certainly no “Tigger” when it comes to my outlook for the economy. Neither am I an “Eeyore.”\n\nAt present, we are slowly healing from the financial crisis and great panic of 2008 and 2009. I expect the healing process to continue and gather momentum over time. I think we will see that growth in the third quarter was substantially greater than what we saw in the second quarter. Absent some shock, I envision a slow but steady improvement in the economy into 2012. That is, if our fiscal authorities will remove their stranglehold on clarifying fiscal initiatives. If not, then, in my view, I expect job creators will remain in a defensive crouch and all bets are off.\n\nRecalling Gov. Dewey\n\nI realize that my view is not presently the conventional one. During the Q&A that followed a speech of mine abroad—in New York—a questioner cited the sickly economic pace of the first half of the year and then recited the consensus view that very weak growth will likely ensue for the rest of the year and beyond, seemingly to eternity. In response, I cautioned that forecasting based on current trends can be very misleading. And the consensus view—usually conveyed with confidence all the way out to three places to the right of the decimal point—is almost always wrong, even within the shortest of time periods.\n\nI asked my interlocutor to recall the presidential election of 1948. The consensus view called for a landslide victory by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. Indeed, an early edition of the Chicago Tribune on the very night of the election announced in the boldest of headlines that Dewey had won. Before going to sleep, an overconfident Dewey is reported to have turned to his wife and said, “Just think about it, darling: Tomorrow night, you are going to be sleeping with the president of the United States!”\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, Mrs. Dewey asked, “Am I going up to Washington this evening or is Harry Truman coming to our house?”\n\nThank you, Mark. That was something of a Ted Straussian travelogue, and I thank you for your patience in letting me cover a broad landscape. In the few minutes we have left, I would be happy to avoid answering any and all questions you might have.",

        "content": "October 7, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Cheryl [Bridges] for that kind introduction. Carl Sewell called me some months ago and invited me here today. Carl and I are the closest of friends. And our two sons, “Little Carl,” as I affectionately call him, and my son Miles are also best buddies. No one on the planet is better at making a sale than Papa Carl and Little Carl, so this is why you are stuck with me as your morning speaker.\n\nThis morning I would like to provide an overview of the national economy and inflation as we see it from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Before doing so, however, allow me to demystify the Federal Reserve System and the Dallas Fed’s role within that System.\n\nFederal Reserve Functions\n\nIf you look closely at the face of any $1 note, you will see a letter in the middle of the left side. Every $1 bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco Fed. Dallas Fed dollars are identified by the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and the inner circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” “K” is the 11th letter in the alphabet—the number “11” is printed in all four corners of the bill. The Dallas Fed is responsible for the administration of the Federal Reserve’s affairs in the 11th of 12 districts that were set up by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Presently, there are nearly $1 trillion worth of Federal Reserve notes in circulation. (Of course, you know that the Eleventh District’s dollars—what I call “Texas Dollars”—are of greater nominal value than the others!)\n\nThe economic activity conducted within the Eleventh District—which includes roughly 27 million people and covers some 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded north of Louisiana—is serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its three branches.\n\nI am the president and CEO of a $110 billion bank. That bank operates at a profit—a profit that we send to the Treasury. Indeed, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, transferred over $125 billion to the Treasury in 2009 and 2010. You are looking at an individual affiliated with one of the few public agencies that actually pay down the federal deficit.\n\nWhat do we do for those 27 million people in the Eleventh District? For starters, we make sure they have the cash they need. In the second quarter of this year, the Dallas Fed distributed and received almost 2.9 billion circulating banknotes, worth over $53 billion at face value. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate around 100,000 bills per hour and process them so they can be shipped from our vaults in El Paso, Houston and Dallas to banks throughout our district, providing you and your customers with folding money. Of course, in addition to making sure there is a sufficient amount in circulation, we have to make sure your folding money is valid and looks respectable: Each month, we pluck out about 35 million worn bills that have lived a full life and are ready to be shredded, sent off to money heaven and replaced by new, crisp notes.\n\nBeginning this year, the Dallas Fed stopped processing checks. (In 2009, we processed 120 million paper checks.) Since the use of paper checks has been, and will continue to be, on a substantial decline as consumers and businesses take up their electronic counterparts, the Federal Reserve Board decided to consolidate all paper-check processing at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (After the loss of LeBron James, losing paper-check processing would have been too much for the city to handle.)\n\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to district depository institutions through our discount window operations—in other words, to be the ultimate banker’s bank. Those of you in this room who are at all affiliated with depository institutions are certainly aware of this vital function. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by providing short-term funding, which is fully secured and collateralized, to depository institutions to help them conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of you and their other customers. Activity levels at the discount window vary with changes in the economic environment. For example, in 2009, during a time of duress, the Dallas Fed made 594 loans approximating $30 billion. In 2010, after Texas had come out of recession, we made only 156 loans for about $3 billion. I chair our credit committee and personally review the loans we make every evening.\n\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our district. Currently, we supervise 37 “state member” banks and 523 bank holding companies. Last June—thanks to the Dodd–Frank Act—we took on the responsibility of supervising savings-and-loan holding companies. We currently have 23 of them in our district.\n\nThis supervisory role is important. I began my private-sector career at the bank of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle: Know your customer. We at the Fed rely upon our regulatory relationship to better know our customers, actively monitoring our constituents’ needs and services on the front line of the commercial banking industry and using this insight to be better lenders to all our customers. Without that supervisory and regulatory responsibility, we could not operate effectively as the nation’s lender of last resort. Moreover, the knowledge gained through banking supervision aids the formation of monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed also organizes public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on significant issues within our economy. Not unimportantly, we work with universities and high schools throughout our district.\n\nCurrency processing, lending as a banker’s bank, banking supervision and public education efforts are integral parts of the Federal Reserve’s job. But you wouldn’t know it if you read the papers: They are not the parts of central banking that usually garner the most public attention. The sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered “sexy”—deal with monetary policy.\n\nThe presidents of the 12 Fed Banks, in addition to the five governors of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to holdups in the nomination and confirmation process by the Senate), normally meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the appropriate policy response. We do so in a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, commonly known as the FOMC. It is in these meetings that we set the base interest rate for interbank lending known as the federal funds, or “fed funds,” rate and where we develop other monetary policy initiatives, like the various programs we put in place to restore liquidity in the commercial paper, mortgage and other markets during the recent financial crisis. Our more recent initiatives are commonly known as “QE2” and “Operation Twist.”\n\nI come to each FOMC meeting armed with input from a research team that provides the intellectual heft for informed monetary policy making, as well as insights provided by Dallas Fed board members—including Chairman Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines and Mike Ullman of J.C. Penney—by businesses that populate my district and by a group of CEOs from around the nation with whom I constantly consult. The Dallas Fed employs a crack team of economists and analysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top-notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an adviser to our research team in Dallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004 (and despite that, offers sensible advice).\n\nThe FOMC is one of the few public service decisionmaking bodies in the country whose members can come together and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions without fear of political retribution and without posturing for the cameras, then hammer out agreement on a course of action based solely on what they solemnly consider judicious for the long-term health of the economy rather than for political convenience. On the afternoon in which we conclude our discussion, we craft a statement for public release explaining the actions taken. We then release a lengthy set of minutes of our deliberations three weeks after our meeting. The minutes of our most recent meeting will be released on Oct. 12. I urge those of you who wish to dig beneath the headlines and better understand the deliberations of the committee, including the views of those like me, who dissented in supporting “Operation Twist,” to pull the minutes off the web. They are only 12 pages long and are readily readable.\n\nThe subject of dissent needs to be placed in context. The president of the United States appoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 Federal Reserve bankers like me, who sit side by side with those governors, are not subject to that process. We are hired and fired by nine-member boards of directors that represent the financial institutions and stakeholders and economic diversity of our respective districts. I want to make this clear: Like the 11 other Federal Reserve Bank presidents, I am not accountable to any Washington politicians, be they Democrat or Republican. I am politically neutered, devoutly nonpartisan and guided solely by what I believe is the best way to craft policy so as to encourage sustainable economic growth with price stability, regardless of who is in the White House or the Congress. I work hard to represent the views and ideals of my part of the country. My fellow Bank presidents and I represent Main Street, not the Washington or Wall Street establishment. Every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the FOMC—which is quite often (I am, after all, a Texan)—I do so very much with that in mind.\n\nIn keeping with that spirit, there are times when I (and other Bank presidents) take a different view of the cost/benefit analysis of proposed initiatives acceptable to a majority of the committee, judge the costs to outweigh the benefits and respectfully cast a dissenting vote. This is in keeping with the culture of the FOMC. When I was offered the job of running the Dallas Fed by its board, I was asked to come see then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. He said, “Richard, one thing is required of you if you accept this job.” I thought: Aha, now I’m going to learn the secrets of the temple. Then he said, “You must always speak to the truth.” And that’s what each member of the FOMC does: We call ’em as we see ’em, whether or not our positions are popular or politically acceptable. At times, we just have an honest difference of opinion, and as Eisenhower once said, “Never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion.” Each and every member of the FOMC, hawk or dove, dissenter or validator of the majority, is totally loyal to the mission of the Federal Reserve.\n\nEconomic Overview\n\nSo what is my honest view of the current economic situation?\n\nOverall, the data show that Texas continues to grow at a modest pace. Our data show Texas gained 13,700 jobs in August after adding 29,300 in July, bringing the total number of jobs created here to 171,200.[1] Year to date through August, our fellow Texans have accounted for 20 percent of the nation’s overall net private-sector job creation. (If you calculate Texas’ contribution to job creation by lopping off those states that have continued losing jobs and consider only those that have positive growth in employment, Texas has accounted for 15 percent).\n\nIn order to more effectively gauge the health of our regional economy, I keep a close eye on both the manufacturing and service sectors in our district. Texas accounts for 10 percent of our nation’s manufacturing output. The Dallas Fed conducts the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey to track this industry, and according to the most recent survey, Texas factory activity increased in September. The production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, rose, suggesting growth picked up last month after stalling in August. Expectations regarding future business conditions, however, were generally less optimistic in September. The index of future general business activity edged down to its first negative reading since April 2009. The index for future company outlook fell as well, staying positive but registering its lowest reading in more than a year. This tells me that considerable uncertainty is hampering the confidence of our manufacturers.\n\nWhile we have good reason to be proud of our manufacturing prowess, the main driver of the Texas economy is the service sector. The service sector accounts for almost 60 percent of private-sector output and employs close to 7 million hardworking Texans. To understand trends in the service sector, we conduct the Texas Service Sector Outlook Survey, covering 230 service-providing firms. According to the most recent survey, Texas service-sector activity increased in September. The revenue index, a key measure of state service-sector conditions, climbed, with one-third of respondents noting that revenue increased from August. Indexes of future service-sector activity remained in positive territory in September. However, expectations regarding future business conditions were mixed. The index of future general business activity remained negative, albeit less so than in our August survey, and the index for future company outlook bounced back into positive territory after posting a negative reading in August.\n\nOf particular interest to this audience, our service-sector survey has a breakout for the retail sector. Retail sales increased in September, according to business executives surveyed, marking two consecutive months of sales growth. Thus, I was not surprised to read this morning that retail sales tracked by Thomson Reuters rose 5.1 percent in September.\n\nIndexes of Texas retail-sector activity remained in positive territory in September, with the exception of part-time employment and hours worked. Expectations regarding broader economic activity improved slightly, although the index of general business activity remained negative.\n\nI should add that we are always looking for ways to improve the accuracy of these surveys. As such, if any of you would be interested in participating in these surveys, please contact me or my staff.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Texas economy continues moving forward, albeit at a slower pace. Nationally, the data are less sanguine. This morning’s payroll report of a gain of 103,000 jobs in September serves only to partially offset the slight gains in the June and August nonfarm payroll reports. The problem remains that we have far too many people out of work and for too long.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nShifting to prices, we continue to see inflationary pressures both at home and abroad, although less so than in the spring. An astute reader of Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal would have noted the article by Ann Zimmerman—who I understand is in the audience today—on page B1.[2] Zimmerman reported that “apparel stores face a double whammy. Many had hoped to raise prices this fall to recoup the cost of cotton, which soared last year and hit historic highs in March before a recent pullback. Now they worry that strapped consumers will resist price increases. If purchases stall, retailers will have to resort to cutting prices instead.”\n\nZimmerman correctly identifies the major issue facing many of the retail contacts nationwide whom I consult before every FOMC meeting. Higher energy and commodity prices have reduced the purchasing power of many American households, many of which continue to suffer from the scourge of unemployment and/or are working to de-lever from over-indebtedness. According to the latest readings, headline inflation increased at an annualized rate of 3 percent in August as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index and 3.75 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index.\n\nNumbers like these will make any central banker’s heart skip a beat—especially mine. Yet a close look at these numbers will reveal that energy and food prices—notoriously volatile items—make up a significant portion of this increase. This is not to say that these increases are unimportant; clearly they are worrisome, and we are following them closely. But our job as policymakers is to focus on underlying inflationary pressures so as to avoid overemphasizing temporary volatility that might lead to faulty conclusions about the course of the economy.\n\nThe question one should ask is: What is the best method to measure future inflationary trends? Headline inflation, important as it is in measuring the rise in someone’s cost of living, accurately characterizes past inflation but is not as informative as one might think for predicting future inflation. For that—counterintuitive as it might seem—it helps to exclude some of the more volatile components. That is why central bankers around the world pay such close attention to underlying measures rather than the headline number. Underlying price movements are more useful in predicting future inflationary trends.\n\nTo that end, the Dallas Fed has come up with a separate and distinct way of calculating core inflation, called the Trimmed Mean PCE analysis. This measure looks at the price movements of 178 items in the consumer basket through a constantly updated series dating back to 1977. We then strip away both the highest and lowest monthly price increases for categories of goods and services to get at the underlying trend. This trimmed-mean inflation rate has become a key component in my economic toolkit, allowing me to better gauge the direction and speed of approaching inflationary winds.\n\nOver the past six months, trimmed-mean inflation has run at a rate of 2 percent. This suggests that headline inflation will likely gravitate down toward 2 percent, a level that the majority of the FOMC believes is a tolerable target.\n\nThe point is that, as of now, higher input prices have not translated into more sustainable general price inflation numbers. We know from anecdotal soundings like Ann’s that American businesses, including retailers, are doing their utmost to offset with higher prices what have been the surging costs of inputs. The issue, which remains unresolved, is whether or not consumers have the wherewithal to take on these price increases. The dubious outlook for employment raises doubts about businesses' pricing power.\n\nOur job as central bankers is to keep broader inflation at bay. I remain on constant watch for signs of inflationary impulses. But, presently, I believe the most urgent issue is creating jobs and reducing unemployment.\n\nIn his testimony before Congress on Tuesday, Chairman (Ben) Bernanke noted that, “Monetary policy can be a powerful tool, but it is not a panacea for the problems currently faced by the U.S. economy. Fostering healthy growth and job creation is a shared responsibility of all economic policymakers, in close cooperation with the private sector. Fiscal policy is of critical importance … a wide range of other policies—pertaining to labor markets, housing, trade, taxation, and regulation, for example—also have important roles to play.”[3]\n\nI have argued this for a couple of years, so I obviously concur with Chairman Bernanke.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has done a great deal to reverse the financial and economic crisis we confronted in 2008 and 2009. We have filled the gas tanks of the economy with affordable liquidity. What is needed now is for employers to confidently step on the pedal and engage the transmission that will use that fuel to move the great job-creating machine of America forward. If I believed further accommodation or fiddling with the yield curve would do the trick and ignite sustainable aggregate demand, I would support it. But the bar for such action remains very high for me until the fiscal authorities do their job by reducing the fiscal and regulatory uncertainty that is holding our mighty economy back.\n\nCheryl, I think I have said enough. So I will end on that, and now do my best to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThank you so much.",

        "content": "October 6, 201 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Mike [Rosa] for that kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at the Texas Economic Development Council’s 2011 annual conference.\n\nLet me first congratulate you on your historic 50th anniversary. From advocating pro-business policies that attract investment and jobs to Texas, to educating our state’s public officials on tax and regulatory matters, this organization has done much to promote and support the economic growth of Texas. So thank you for making my job much easier.\n\nThere are few subjects I enjoy speaking about more than the Texas economy. For reasons well known to all of you, Texas’ record of economic growth and job creation provides an oasis in a national economic desert devoid of life-giving job creation. This record has become a subject of intense interest to the national media. Indeed, my staff and I at the Dallas Fed have been deluged with requests for data on all aspects of the Texas economy.\n\nToday I will attempt to separate fact from fiction, with a heavy focus on the data. In particular, I will take both a short- and long-term view of the Texas economy and wrap-up with some of the challenges facing our state as we go forward.\n\nFederal Reserve Functions\n\n\n\nBefore I dive into these weighty matters, I think it best to provide some background on the Fed so you’ll understand where I am coming from. If you look closely at the face of any $1 note, you will see a letter in the middle of the left side. Every $1 bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco Fed. On the screen behind me you will see that this bill has the letter “K” printed on its face and four “11s” printed near each corner. The Dallas Fed is the 11th Federal Reserve District out of 12 operating across the country. K is the 11th letter in the alphabet. There are two concentric circles around this letter K. The outermost says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas.” The innermost circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” I like to chide my colleagues that not all dollar bills are equal. I tell them those with the letter K on them—what I call “Texas dollars”—are worth more than all the rest because they represent the nation’s most dynamic economic machine.\n\nThe 12 Federal Reserve Banks were set up by federal law in 1913. I am president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which, together with our branches in Houston, San Antonio and El Paso, handles the business of the Fed in this part of the country. We are responsible for ordering and distributing paper money according to the needs of our district, supervising and regulating banks, lending money against good collateral to all banks in our district for their operating needs—whether we supervise them or not, handling payments (for a fee) for the U.S. Treasury, doing economic studies, educating the public on basic financial matters and helping determine the nation’s monetary policy at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nAt the FOMC table, I represent the perspectives of some 27 million people who reside in the approximately 360,000 square miles of land that stretches from northern Louisiana to southern New Mexico and produces an economic output that is greater than that of Mexico or Australia and, until recently, exceeded that of India.\n\nThe Dallas Fed makes a profit through its lending and other fee-generating activities: We receive no tax appropriations. After paying a small preferred dividend to the member banks of our district, we turn over our annual profit to the U.S. Treasury. Indeed, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, transferred over $125 billion to the Treasury in 2009 and 2010. You are looking at an odd duck: A member of a team within a government agency that doesn’t swallow taxpayer money but, instead, operates with private-sector efficiency and uses its profits to directly pay down the nation’s debt.\n\nAnother thing that makes me an odd duck: I am not accountable to any political authority. Unlike the five members of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to a hold-up in the nomination and confirmation process), neither I nor my counterparts who operate the Fed’s business through the 12 Reserve Banks are appointed by the president of the United States or confirmed by the U.S. Senate. I was selected for this job by—and serve at the pleasure of—the nine directors who compose the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank board, all of whom are citizens of the Fed’s Eleventh District. That board, which was chaired by Ray Hunt when I was hired, has been chaired by Jim Hackett, CEO of Anadarko Petroleum, and currently is led by Herb Kelleher, founder of Southwest Airlines. The board consists of eight others who hail from Dallas, Houston, Plano, Brady, Huntsville, Fort Worth and Alamogordo, N.M. The Dallas Fed is a Main Street operation.\n\nWhen I was sworn into office, I checked all politics and partisanship at the door. I am neither an “R” nor a “D”; I am politically indifferent. When I took this job, Alan Greenspan told me I had only one obligation, which in his words was “to speak to the truth.” I do my best to speak the straight skinny, informed by the work of the staff of the Dallas Fed, the input I receive from the bankers and businesses and citizens of my district, and my own career as a banker, an investor, a trade negotiator and a man smart enough to come to Texas 37 years ago.\n\nThe Texas Economy\n\nSo what is the straight skinny about the Texas economy?\n\nThe Texas economy has a long tradition of outperforming the nation—a tradition matched only by our long-standing reputation for modesty. From December 1967 through December 2007—the most recent employment peak according to the National Bureau of Economic Research—long-run nonfarm job growth in Texas exceeded that of the nation by 1.1 percentage points.\n\nOver the past 20 years, employment has grown at a compound annual growth rate of about 1.9 percent and our economic output has expanded at a 3.6 percent annual rate. On the screen is what we call a “spaghetti chart”—it charts employment growth in the Eleventh District economy (the bulk of which is Texas) relative to other Fed districts for the past 20 years. This graph says it all: We have consistently outperformed the rest of the nation in growing economic prosperity.\n\n\n\nWe continued that performance over the past three especially difficult years. Texas was last into the recent frightful recession and one of the strongest coming out. In 2008, the nadir of the downturn, we were still creating jobs here. In fact, while the U.S. lost 3.1 million jobs, Texas added 45,000 private-sector jobs in 2008. But stout as we are, we caught the recessionary flu at the onset of the fall of 2008, with the result that we lost 362,000 jobs in 2009. We recovered quickly and at a faster pace than the rest of the nation. We added jobs in 2010, and we have continued to add jobs in 2011. So far this year, we have added 171,200 jobs (including 13,700 jobs in August) and grown at an annual pace of 2.5 percent—more than twice the national average of 1 percent.[1]\n\nIn fact, the only other states that are back to or have punched through their previous peak employment levels are Alaska and North Dakota, which, combined, have a population of 1.4 million good citizens. As of August, the Texas unemployment rate stood at 8.5 percent. To be sure, this is lower than the national average of 9.1 percent. But while our recovery has outpaced that of the nation thus far, unemployment remains stubbornly high and too many Texans are out of work. A big part of your job as economic development professionals is to help craft the incentives for business to invest and create jobs here and drive down that rate of unemployment.[2]\n\nA quick plug: As fellow Texans who are interested in the economic development of our great state, I encourage you to visit our website (www.dallasfed.org) for factual, nonpoliticized briefs on the Texas economy. There you will find a plethora of economic briefings and economic data, including the job-creation figures that get bandied about in debates among presidential aspirants. At a minimum, I am hopeful our web postings will help you separate spin from reality and fact from fiction, as well as dispel some of the stereotypes of Texas.\n\nEconomic Prognostications\n\nI expect that during the Q&A, you might ask me for a forecast for Texas’ economic growth going forward. Let me head that off at the pass. I am wary of precise economic forecasts. Economics is more an art form than a science, despite claims to the contrary. As such, economic prognostications need to be taken with a grain of salt, even when delivered by Federal Reserve officials, for they are seldom accurate and are subject to constant revisions. One of my professors in college used to say that “the only function of economic forecasting is to make astrology look respectable.”\n\nSo let me just say—as a Piscean—that our Texas economy continues to face significant headwinds, including uncertainty that derives from the indecision or sometimes counterproductive decisions of the national government. And we will continue to be handicapped by low levels of construction activity, reduced state and local government spending and still moderate gains in consumer spending and demand. Despite these conditions, I expect Texas job growth to continue increasing at a moderate pace, but only if we can preserve the image and reality of Texas’ uniqueness as a place to do business and grow profits. Profit-making enterprises create jobs. We have too many unemployed workers. We need to attract businesses to come here and grow here. To do so, we have to press our comparative advantage relative to other states.\n\nComparative Advantage\n\nSo what is our comparative advantage?\n\nAs I see it, the key to Texas’ success lies in our ability to change to a rapidly globalized and competitive economic landscape. Texas’ transition from a resource-based economy built on cattle, cotton and oil to a knowledge-based economy built on human capital and innovation is our greatest success. We have made a fine transition “from cow chips to computer chips” and “from boots to suits.” Texas has mastered the art of what the iconic economist, Joseph Schumpeter, called “creative destruction.” We don’t linger long on the old, and we are quick to usher in the new.\n\nIn the 1930 census, for example, agriculture represented 39 percent of all jobs in the state; today, it is less than 2 percent. Despite this decrease, we continue to be one of the top agriculture-producing states in the nation. We are currently No. 1 in ranching and No. 2 in terms of crop production.\n\nIn 1981, oil and gas extraction made up 18 percent of the state’s output. After the oil bust, we diversified our economy and that share dropped significantly. That said, we are certainly blessed with abundant natural resources here, and we most definitely benefit on net from high commodity prices. Currently, oil and gas extraction contributes about 9.5 percent to state output and employs about 2 percent of our workforce.\n\nIn 1970, 15 percent of Texas jobs were in manufacturing. Presently, manufacturing accounts for only 7 percent of our employment, though output in manufacturing has fallen much less, from 18 percent to 15 percent. These sectors saw a decline in job share not due to the demise of industry, but rather because productivity growth has allowed technology to do more of the work. This has allowed labor to shift to other areas of the economy that are in high demand as our population has become wealthier. These include health care, education, finance, professional business services and leisure services.\n\nA key source of Texas’ growth in manufacturing and services has been technology. A recent Milken Institute study on high-tech centers across the U.S. concludes that Texas has three of the top 25 high-tech centers in the country—Dallas, Houston and Austin.[3] Another study by the Milken Institute ranked Texas ninth in its Technology Concentration and Dynamism Composite Index, which measures “the stock of capable entrepreneurs and risk capital available to support the conversion of research into commercially viable technology products and services.”[4]\n\nThe key factors that have contributed to our ability to grow and adapt to the changing landscape are low tax and regulatory burdens, flexible labor markets, open land availability, the success of tort reform, great seaports, airports and transportation and communication infrastructure, and, simply put, the fact that people come here to work and better themselves. All these factors have contributed to a low cost of living and have made doing business in Texas much easier.\n\nBusinesses sell to national and international markets and must compete with producers throughout the world. As a result, they seek areas of production where nominal wages are low for a given level of worker productivity. What matters to workers, however, is their real wages—what they can buy for an honest day’s work. A worker can move from the Silicon Valley or Boston to Dallas or Austin (or Fort Worth or Houston or San Antonio or El Paso), and both the company and the worker are better off. The company can pay him, say, 15 percent less, and yet the worker, who spends a significantly smaller amount for the same home he had in Silicon Valley or Boston, is taxed at lower rates, finds the cost of living cheaper and sees his real income increase by a significant amount. This is what I call the “pull factor,” and it has been a key component of the net immigration of workers and job-creating businesses to the state of Texas.\n\nData from the 2010 census show that net domestic immigration to Texas has been positive every year for the past 19 years. In just the past five years, net migration from other U.S. states (not including international migration) has totaled about 690,000 individuals—equivalent to about 40 percent of the population of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area. Positive net migration from other states is a key indicator that we are, in fact, exceptional. People do vote with their feet. They are moving to Texas from other states and from abroad because we offer them something better than they had before.[5]\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed. A recent report published by the Brookings Institution in Washington ranked Austin as the No. 1 city in the U.S. and No. 26 in the world in terms of jobs and income growth during the current economic recovery.[6] The Brookings explanation for Austin’s (and Texas’) success: “continued attraction and retention of high-skilled human capital, its diverse set of export-based industries, and its avoidance of the worst U.S. housing market excesses.” This same study ranked Dallas fourth in the U.S. and 39th in the world in terms of the strength of the recovery. San Antonio ranked 11th and 51st, respectively, while Houston ranked 15th and 61st. As to how others held up during the recession itself, Brookings cited San Antonio as the most “recession-proof” city in the United States.\n\nIn case you are looking for further evidence, the Lone Star State also dominated the Milken Institute’s 2010 Best-Performing Cities index.[7] According to this report, Texas “metros occupied 11 of the top 25 positions among the 200 largest metros in the country and five of the top 10.” It goes on to note that, “Another way to highlight Texas’ dominance is that just two of the state’s 13 metros didn’t make the top 25.” The institute’s reason for Texas’ outperformance—“Texas metros have benefited from a low reliance on durable goods manufacturing, a low cost of doing business, a favorable business climate, the benefits of BRAC [Defense Base Realignment and Consolidation] activities, greater reliance on trade with Mexico and South America … and ongoing energy exploration activities and alternative fuels research.”\n\nVulnerabilities\n\nThere is a lot of room for Texas brag when we talk about our economy and our potential. But we also have vulnerabilities that keep Texas from reaching its full potential. In the latest rankings on the competitiveness of states, the Beacon Hill Institute gave mixed results to Texas. The “good news,” according to the institute, is that Texas scores high on overall tax burden, employment in high-tech industries, venture capital, initial public offerings, low unionization, unrestrictive minimum wages, exports, foreign direct investment and percent of population born abroad who come to work. The bad news: Texas ranks near the bottom in most human capital measures. Texas is dead last in the percent of the adult population that graduated from high school, 37th in percent of population enrolled in degree-granting institutions, 35th in academic R&D and 41st in science and engineering degrees awarded.[8]\n\nWhen you get a chance, take a look at the membership list for the Association of American Universities (AAU), which is regarded by most scholars as the definition of the cream of the crop of research universities. The AAU consists of 59 U.S. (and two Canadian) universities. These 59 U.S. schools garner over 50 percent of all federal R&D dollars to colleges and universities; they are home to 87 percent of all elected members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine—the highest recognition in each of those fields. Since 1901, 35 percent of all Nobel Prizes have gone to individuals affiliated with AAU universities.[9]\n\nCalifornia has nine AAU members. The New York area also has nine. And Texas? We have three: Rice, UT–Austin and Texas A&M.\n\nAnother source that underscores the Achilles’ heel of Texas’ economy is U.S. News & World Report. According to its assessment, Massachusetts has 10 schools ranked in the top 100 universities. The New York area has 11 and California has 13. We have only six: Rice, ranked 17th, UT–Austin (45th), Texas A&M (58th), SMU (62nd), Baylor (75th) and TCU (97th).[10] I admire the Rice Owls, but I am embarrassed by having them as the sole university in the nation’s top 20. You should be, too. We ought to have several.\n\nYou can’t be happy with the fact that we are falling behind in all aspects of education, from kindergarten right up to the university level. Think about it. We know that incomes and net worth are directly correlated to educational attainment. We know that in the Knowledge Age in which we live, the mind is the capital plant of the modern economy. We all admire those who work with their muscles and by the sweat of their brow in pulling prosperity from the soil on our farms and ranches, or from deep beneath the earth in our mighty oil and gas sector. We rightly applaud those who help Texas produce almost 10 percent of the nation’s manufactured goods. But the world of today and tomorrow is driven by digits, not widgets. We will continue to move up the value-added ladder and stay ahead of the competition—not just from other states, but from China and the new emerging powers—only if we are able to nurture and harness Texas brains.\n\nWe must not lose track of this simple, unalterable, indisputable, critical fact: We have done well so far; our economy is mighty. But to stay ahead of the curve and compete in tomorrow’s global marketplace, Texas must better educate its population.\n\nMy plea is that each of you makes it one of your principal goals to make Texas an educational powerhouse. High-value-added, job-creating businesses that are world beaters will not move their top executives to Texas unless they can send their children and grandchildren to top schools and universities.\n\nWhatever our ethnicity or origin, Texans are a race of risk takers. We have from the very start defied conventional wisdom. We must now take risks, defy conventional wisdom and turn around our education system. Our economic future depends upon it.\n\nLone Star\n\nIf you’re looking for motivation to do what most others consider unthinkable, dust off T.R. Fehrenbach’s history of Texas, titled Lone Star.[11] It’s a long book—some 719 pages. But it is most readable and is, to my mind, perhaps the finest history of Texas ever written, though it has now been over 40 years since it was first printed.\n\nFor example, Fehrenbach walks his readers through how Mirabeau B. Lamar moved the capital to Austin in 1840. Then, only 900 people lived there on the border of Comanche country, facing a wild, frightful, untamed western frontier. Yet, here we are today, as I mentioned, with one of the most elite think tanks in the country concluding that Austin is the highest ranked of all American cities in this recovery and ranked internationally, incidentally, just below Säo Paulo and above Montreal. Little old Austin, ranked right up there with two of the best-known cities in the world. Who would have thought that possible?\n\nWho would have dared think that in the blink of history’s eye, Texas would be outproducing Mexico or Australia and giving the more than 1 billion people of India a run for their money? Fehrenbach recites how great men and establishment figures of the time like John Quincy Adams scoffed at Houston and Lamar and at Texas. Too bad they aren’t around now to see what those early Texans and their successors set in train.\n\nWhat has been accomplished here could only have been made possible by a people who understand that it pays to respect the “animal spirits” that drive the entrepreneurialism and risk taking that push the economic frontier both literally and figuratively. As Fehrenbach puts it: “The Texan ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise … work was the real virtue.”  “We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.” We are a people for whom “the cult of courage was obvious.”\n\nFehrenbach distills the Texas spirit into one simple sentence: “Men who exist get overrun by men who act.”\n\nNow, if you were from a part of the United States where the past is more glorious than the future and you were listening to what I have said today, you would at this point of the speech likely be thinking this all sounds like something that rhymes with “bull wit.” But we who live here know this place and its spirit.\n\nConsider yourselves the trustees of the future of our children’s generation and all that come after it. You hold the future of this unique franchise we call Texas in your hands. Your job is to keep Texas exceptional—to create the conditions that safeguard and nourish our prosperity and that of our children and our children’s children. If you do, I have no doubt we will continue to outshine the rest of the nation for another 50 years.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "September 27, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Anne [Motsenbocker]. I was privileged to have been a member of the Dallas Assembly before I aged into being “mature.” Being here today with you young folks brings back very fond memories and is wonderfully energizing. Thank you for inviting me to lunch today.\n\nJan Mayen Island\n\nI am going to start by taking you far away from Dallas, near the Arctic Circle, where, were you to visit Jan Mayen Island, you would see this sign:\n\n\n\nJan Mayen is a desolate volcanic island located about 600 miles west of Norway’s North Cape. It is the home of a meteorological and communications station manned in the harshest of winters by 17 hearty members of the Norwegian Armed Forces. If you read Tom Clancy’s Hunt for Red October, you would know it as “Loran-C,” a NATO tracking and transmissions station. In the video game Tomb Raider: Underworld, Lara Croft visits Jan Mayen in search of Thor’s Hammer, considered the most awesome of weapons in Norse mythology, capable of leveling mountains and performing the most heroic feats.\n\nMy brother Mike recently visited this station on Jan Mayen. This is the sign that greeted him.\n\nIn norsk, it reads as follows:\n\n“Theory is when you understand everything, but nothing works.”\n\n“Practice is when everything works, but nobody understands why.”\n\n“At this station, theory and practice are united, so nothing works and nobody understands why.”\n\nMy wry brother implied that this about summed it up for monetary policy. Drawing on theory and practice, the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been working in the harshest economic environment to harness monetary theory and lessons learned from practice to revive the economy and job creation without forsaking our commitment to maintaining price stability. But the committee’s policy has yet to show evidence of working and nobody seems to quite understand why.\n\nToday, I am going to quickly summarize the action taken by the FOMC at our meeting last week. I am going to explain at greater length why I dissented from the consensus of the committee, incorporating why I believe the monetary accommodation we have thus far implemented has failed to deliver.\n\nI remind you that conducting monetary policy in today’s economy is not for the faint of heart. All 17 of us who have the privilege of serving on the FOMC are working toward the same end. We devote ourselves to crafting the right monetary policy for the nation. When we meet, each of us lays out our arguments calmly, with great respect for each other and without acrimony—an approach that is sadly rare elsewhere in government. As I represent the Dallas Fed at the FOMC table, I want you and others to know what my views are so that you might have a better understanding of the difficult trade-offs involved in our decisionmaking.\n\nLast Week’s FOMC Meeting\n\nAfter meeting for two days last week, the committee announced that its outlook for the economy was less sanguine than it had previously anticipated. It foresaw “significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.” Realizing that resolution of the European situation depends on European authorities, we focused on policy alternatives that might bolster the U.S. economy. The committee decided that it would “purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and ... sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. This program,” the committee stated, “should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative.” In addition, the FOMC also reaffirmed the expectation it expressed at the August meeting, “that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate”—the interest rate we set for overnight interbank lending—“at least through mid-2013.”\n\nConcurrently, the committee decided it would depart from its previous decision to invest the proceeds from the roll-offs from its substantial portfolio of mortgage-backed and agency—Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—securities into Treasuries and would instead “reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.”[1]\n\nIn the interest of time, I will not dwell on the decision to reinvest proceeds in the agency and mortgage-backed markets. Since the beginning of this year, the spreads between mortgage-backs and Treasuries have been widening and have accelerated, especially lately, to levels last seen in early 2009. This decision, while not expected by the markets, was acceptable for me as a tactical way to provide limited assistance to the mortgage market at little cost. The decision to embark on an “Operation Twist,” however, was a strategic decision where I did not feel the benefits outweighed what I perceived to be the costs. So, I will dwell on that difficult decision.\n\nThe Rationale Behind Operation Twist\n\nAs the minutes of last week’s meeting will not be released until Oct. 12, it would be inappropriate for me to provide you a fulsome recital of the discussion that took place at the table. When you do read the minutes, however, it might help to recall a little history.\n\nThe original Operation Twist was announced by President Kennedy on Feb. 2, 1961. It was actually the idea of my mentor, Robert Roosa, who later hired me out of Stanford Business School in 1975 to be his assistant, following in the footsteps of other “Roosa Boys”—the first of whom was a fellow named Paul Volcker. In the original Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve sold a portion of the short-term Treasuries held in its System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio and invested the proceeds in longer-dated Treasuries. The goal was to decrease long-term rates and increase investment, while increasing short-term rates so as to prop up the dollar.\n\nThe purpose of Operation Twist II is similar: The FOMC seeks to drive down the cost of capital for businesses in order to induce them to invest more in expansion and create more jobs. Implicitly, the program may also lift short-term rates, albeit mildly given the expectation that rates at the short end will remain at “exceptionally low levels” through mid-2013, perhaps providing some relief to money market funds that, in searching for yields sufficient to cover their costs, have been invested in foreign bank paper now considered by many analysts to be somewhat toxic.\n\nAs background to my take on this newer version of Operation Twist, I want to make it crystal clear that I am as eager as anyone on the committee to see greater job creation. It is true that I am an inflation hawk: I believe the foremost duty of any central banker is to ensure price stability. Indeed, I believe that the Fed cannot deliver on its congressionally mandated task of seeking full employment unless it delivers first on its mandated duty of warding off both inflation and deflation.\n\nThe Dallas Fed tracks 178 items in the consumer basket through a constantly updated series dating back to 1977. Using this data, we calculate what we call a “trimmed mean” analysis of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in order to ascertain the level of inflation affecting real consumers.[2] This is my preferred compass for charting the direction of inflation. It presently suggests that headline inflation will decline from its current level—just shy of 3 percent as measured by the PCE and 3.75 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index—to 2 percent, a level that the majority of the committee believes a tolerable target. Thus, while I remain on constant watch for signs of inflationary impulses, I believe the most urgent issue is job creation and the reduction of the scourge of unemployment.\n\nI believe, however, that there is significant risk that the policies recently undertaken by the FOMC are likely to prove ineffective and might well be working against job creation.\n\nPrevious Dissents\n\nIn the interest of time, I will neither repeat the reason for my opposition to the round of accommodation known as QE2 nor discuss my dissenting vote in August, when the committee indicated its expectation that rates would remain exceptionally low through mid-2013. I have explained my logic in previous speeches, which are located on our website.[3]\n\nI’ll focus here on Operation Twist and the decisions announced last Wednesday. There is a common theme running through my dissenting views on Operation Twist, QE2 and what has come to be viewed as a commitment by the market that we will hold the fed funds rate “extremely low” for the next two years. My fundamental concern is about the efficacy of these initiatives.\n\nEfficacy Questions\n\nThe efficacy of the original Operation Twist has been vigorously debated through time. Bob Roosa once confided in me that he considered it “too clever by half” and “not (his) brightest brainchild.” Bob’s self-deprecation was recently quantified in a study by Eric Swanson of the San Francisco Fed. Swanson estimated that the impact of the 1961 program resulted in a 15-basis-point reduction—remember, 15 basis points is 15 one-hundredths of 1 percent—in long-term Treasury yields and a 2- to 4-basis-point—2 to 4 one-hundredths of 1 percent—reduction in corporate bond yields.[4] Swanson’s paper follows upon an insightful study by two top economists at Northwestern University who estimated that QE2—the previous round of accommodation—lowered Treasury yields by roughly 20 basis points and investment grade corporate bond yields by about 7 to 12 basis points.[5]\n\nTo nonfinancial market types, this may seem a tad bit esoteric. The point is that the direct benefit of QE2 seemed small relative to the cost, including the complications arising from the expansion of our balance sheet and the stirring of suspicions among our critics that the FOMC is influenced too heavily by the financial interests that make more money from trading than from lending to job-creating businesses.\n\nFor me, Swanson’s study begged questions about the cost/benefit trade-offs of a modern Operation Twist from a theoretical perspective. From a practical perspective, I had other concerns.\n\nBefore every FOMC meeting, I survey a select group of 30 or so private business and banking operators, imparting no information about monetary policy but listening carefully to their perspectives on developments in the economy as seen at the ground level. For weeks leading up to the meeting, there was speculation in the financial markets and in the press that an Operation Twist was being contemplated. I received an earful of opinions on these rumors. What I gleaned from those conversations was as follows:\n\nOne other factor gave me pause and that was, and remains, the moral hazard of being too accommodative. For years, I have been arguing that monetary policy cannot solve the problem of substandard economic performance unless it is complemented by fiscal policy and regulatory reform that encourages the private sector to put to work the affordable and abundant liquidity we are able to create as the nation’s monetary authority. These actions are not within the Fed’s purview; they are the business of Congress and the president. Chairman (Ben) Bernanke said it well in his recent speech at Jackson Hole (Wyo.): “Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank.”[6] Both within the FOMC and in public speeches, I have argued that until our fiscal authorities get their act together, further monetary accommodation—be it in the form of quantitative easing or performing “jujitsu” on the yield curve through efforts such as Operation Twist—will represent nothing more than pushing on a string.\n\nOf course, I am only a single voice at the FOMC table. I presented my views, as did other participants. All views were given a fair hearing. In the end, the decision taken by the FOMC is that of the majority, and the majority supported the initiatives that were announced. We must now hope that they will work.\n\nThe Siren Call of Inflation\n\nI might conclude by sharing my concerns about the prospect of temporarily allowing more inflation as a means of unlocking expansion in final demand.\n\nI understand the theoretical basis for entertaining that thesis: If businesses and consumers believe prices will rise, they will rush out to invest and consume now. But the practical aspects of this approach appear to counter the theoretical.\n\nPaul Volcker, who has the scars on his back from his Herculean effort to rein in inflation in the 1980s, wrote of this in the New York Times on Sept. 18.[7] He reminded us that once unleashed, inflation combines with stagnation to make stagflation, the most painful of all combinations for the poor, for workers, for job seekers, for bond and stock holders and for businesses trying to navigate the economy.\n\nHis words from that article should be engraved on the foreheads of every central banker: “The siren song [of inflation] is both alluring and predictable. … After all, if 1 or 2 percent inflation is O.K. and has not raised inflationary expectations—as the Fed and most central banks believe—why not 3 or 4 or even more? Let’s try to get business to jump the gun and invest now in the expectation of higher prices later … and maybe wages will follow. … Well, good luck. Some mathematical models spawned in academic seminars might support this scenario. But all of our economic history says it won’t work that way. I thought we learned that lesson in the 1970s. … What we know, or should know, from the past is that once inflation becomes anticipated and ingrained—as it eventually would—then the stimulating effects are lost. Once an independent central bank does not simply tolerate a low level of inflation as consistent with ‘stability,’ but invokes inflation as a policy, it becomes difficult to eliminate.”\n\nTo that I say, “Amen.”\n\nThor’s Hammer\n\nI return to where I began—Jan Mayen Island. Paul Volcker understands better than most the limitations of theory and the harsh lessons of practice. I have nowhere near the wisdom or the experience of Volcker. But as the son of a Norwegian mother, I do know a little about Norse mythology. The legend holds that with his hammer in hand, Thor “would be able to strike as firmly as he wanted … and the hammer would never fail … and never fly so far from his hand that it could not find its way back.”[8] Monetary policy is not Thor’s hammer. It is an awesome weapon. But it has limitations. We must carefully harbor its power. If we deploy it incorrectly, we might level more than interest rates and destroy that which we seek to create. And if we let it fly too far from our grasp, we may never get it back. In conducting policy going forward, we must constantly bear this in mind.",

        "content": "September 12, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Pat [Faubion]. Thank you all for inviting me to speak at this National Association for Business Economics (NABE) annual meeting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has long been involved with NABE. Our director of research and my trusted senior policy advisor, Harvey Rosenblum, is a former NABE president (2001–02). Another of my policy advisors, Tom Siems, is a two-time winner of NABE’s Edmund A. Mennis Contributed Paper Award. And Ken Rogoff, winner of this year’s Adam Smith Award, is a member of the Dallas Fed’s Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute advisory board.\n\nI benefit greatly from the insights of these talented people, as well as those of Mine Yücel and Roberto Coronado, who are also speaking to you at this conference, and one of my mentors, our Dallas Fed board chairman, Herb Kelleher, who entertained you at lunch. Herb may be the only person on the planet who discovered the formula for making a retail business with high fixed costs and intense regulatory oversight not only fly but soar; his insights into how the economy works in practice, as opposed to theory, are invaluable.\n\nI am pleased that Dick Berner, a former NABE president now at Treasury, running the Office of Financial Research, is here. I believe it was Dick who, during a round of golf at Jackson Hole [Wyo.] long ago, told me the bad joke about the fellow who suggested that a moose crossing sign be moved because “there is too much auto traffic where the sign is currently located.”\n\nI also see Bill Dunkelberg, another former NABE president, who has been most generous in sharing with me and my staff his understanding of the whys and wherefores of small business, an important input into the way we look at things at the Dallas Fed.\n\nThere are many others here today whom I would acknowledge if time permitted, but I ask their forbearance so that we can get down to business.\n\nAs learned economists, you are fully aware of the nation’s predicament. Chairman [Ben] Bernanke reviewed it concisely in his speech at Jackson Hole and again, just last week, in Minneapolis. Knowing that most of you read those speeches, my guess is that you are looking to me for two things today. The first, given that you are in Dallas and the nation is in the throes of a presidential election season with two Texas contenders for their party’s nomination, would be the Dallas Fed’s perspective on the much-discussed Texas economy. Second, I’m guessing you are looking for some insight into what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is going to do next, insight Chairman Bernanke, as leader of our pack, wisely avoided imparting in his recent comments.\n\nThe Texas Economy\n\nOn the Texas front, my colleagues and I at the Dallas Fed have lately been deluged with requests for data on all aspects of the Texas economy—which accounts for 95 percent of the Eleventh District’s output and the economic activity of some 25 million of the 27 million people living in our district. If you are interested, you can go to our website (www.dallasfed.org) to receive a factual, nonpoliticized brief on the Texas economy, including the job creation figures that get bandied about in debates among presidential aspirants. We update these numbers monthly—the data for the August employment figures will be tabulated on our website on Sept. 19—and we will keep updating them so that analysts can parse the data.\n\nAt a minimum, I am hopeful our web postings will help you separate spin from reality and fact from fiction, as well as dispel some of the stereotypes of Texas.\n\nFor example, we are blessed with abundant natural resources here, and we most definitely do benefit on net from high commodity prices; oil and gas extraction contributes about 9.5 percent to state output. Yet, when jobs are tallied, the contribution of oil and gas accounts for only 2 percent of the Texas workforce. Indeed, if you peruse our website, you will see that since the National Bureau of Economic Research proclaimed the recovery’s start in June 2009, education and health services, which employs 13.5 percent of Texas’ workers, and professional and business services, which employs another 12.5 percent, have gained 173,000 jobs during the recovery—nearly 60 percent of all the jobs added in Texas. The Texas workforce consists of more than just roustabouts and cowboys, though we are certainly proud of that heritage. Those of you who are here for the first time have no doubt already noticed this as you have wandered around Dallas and have seen nary an oil rig nor a cow.\n\nWhile you are looking at the research material on our site, you might also look over the Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey, which we refer to by the acronym TMOS. Since 2004, TMOS has had the highest correlation of all Fed bank surveys with the Institute for Supply Management’s national manufacturing index. And you might find of interest our monthly service sector and retail outlook surveys. Mine might brief you on the most recent results of these during your session with her this afternoon.\n\nPolicy Background\n\nEnough about Texas per se. I am, however, going to put up on the screen behind me a slide that bridges developments in the Texas economy and the nation’s economic predicament. I’ll use this to lead into a discussion of the issues facing policymakers as we go forward.\n\n\n\nThis slide was put together for a briefing recently by Harvey Rosenblum. It charts employment by Federal Reserve district from the time job creation peaked in each district until today. A quick explanation to make this easier on the eye: The bottom, or horizontal axis, is the time in months since employment peaked in each district. For example, it has been roughly 54 months since employment peaked in the Atlanta district, which is depicted by the tan bottom line; it has been 36 months since employment peaked in the Dallas district, as shown in the shorter red line at the top. Observing the vertical axis, you can see that the only Fed district that is recovering to employment levels enjoyed at the peak is Dallas. In point of fact, the only other states that are back to or have punched through their previous peak employment levels are Alaska and North Dakota, which, combined, have a population of 1.4 million good citizens. The other 11 Fed districts are hovering at levels approximately 3 to 8 percent below peak employment, while the nation as a whole—the black line—is still 5 percent below the levels that prevailed in 2008.\n\nOf course, in Texas we have a long tradition of outperforming the nation—a tradition matched only by our long-standing reputation for modesty. The 1.1 percentage-point gap we’ve seen between Texas and national job growth over the current recovery corresponds almost exactly to the long-run (40-year) historical gap between our growth rate and the nation’s.\n\nThe shortfall in jobs at the national level is but one indicator of the pervasive anguish of American households since the Panic of 2008. Another sign of that anguish is that average real per capita net worth in the United States has not regained the losses incurred in the latter part of the last decade. At the end of the first quarter of 2011, average per capita net worth was nearly 14 percent below the peak seen four years earlier. Real income has not fared as badly, but per capita salary income is, nevertheless, almost 2 percent below its peak in the first quarter of 2008. A likely widening of income dispersion over the period, however, suggests that median income has probably fared worse. We will get a better read on this when the Federal Reserve Board completes it triennial Survey of Consumer Finances early next year. I do not expect that survey to paint a pretty picture.\n\nI am most aware, as are many of you, that if history is any guide, getting back to where we were will be no small task. The 2008–09 recession was precipitated by a banking crisis. A number of you, including Ken Rogoff, have shown that downturns associated with banking crises tend to be the most severe, and that clawing back lost employment and output in the aftermath of a financial crisis is most vexing. My colleague Mark Wynne, who directs our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, has written an excellent brief on this for our Economic Letter publication, which should be posted on our website today.\n\n\n\nThis chart of output relative to precrisis trend summarizes Mark’s conclusion: Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008, “performance of real GDP in the U.S. is almost exactly in line with what we might have expected based on the average experience of other countries that have gone through banking crises.”[1] This chart is most definitely not a pretty sight.\n\nSmall wonder that American consumers—and the businesses that hire and serve them—remain in a defensive crouch. The question is: How do we change the picture? How do we get the pistons of job creation, income growth and wealth restoration pumping again?\n\nThis is the gist of the discussion at the FOMC table. The press and others delineate the viewpoints around the table on an ornithological scale, dividing us up into doves and hawks. I am classified according to that delineation as a hawk. I am not offended by this, but, not unlike the stereotyping of Texas, I consider it simplistic. We are actually birds of a feather in that we are simply trying to figure out the proper way to conduct monetary policy in order to live up to our dual mandate. Each of us does our utmost to craft monetary policy so as to engender restoration of full employment in the context of price stability.\n\nA word about price stability. At the Dallas Fed, we look at prices through a different lens than others. We are of the strong opinion that Jim Dolmas’ trimmed mean analysis of personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—an analytical survey of 178 items in the consumer basket that we have tracked in a constantly updated series dating to 1977—provides the best insight into prices impacting consumers and the likely path of prices going forward.\n\nThe Dallas Trimmed Mean PCE recorded an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in July, up from a more moderate 1.4 percent in June. Looking over the six-month horizon—which averages out some of the month-to-month wiggles—the trimmed mean is up precisely 2 percent on an annualized basis. Over the same six months, the headline PCE index is up 3.1 percent, owing to sharp increases in the prices of gasoline and, to a lesser but not unimportant extent, food. Barring further surges in those components, we would expect the headline rate to gravitate toward the trimmed mean rate of 2 percent over the coming months. We shall see.\n\nThe point is that while I feel the most important role for a central banker is to maintain price stability—and I am always on watch, hawk-like, on the inflationary front—I share with equal intensity the concern of my FOMC colleagues about the employment picture and the overall fragility of our economy. I am keen on finding ways to close the income and output gaps depicted in these two slides and restore economic momentum. I find the last employment report and the recent Federal Reserve Bank surveys of activity, including the Dallas Fed’s, to be discouraging in this regard.\n\nWhen people are frightened, they understandably look for a “fix.” Yet, my colleagues and I are professionally beholden to beware of short-term fixes that might contradict, or place in jeopardy, the long-term duty and credibility of the central bank. I am wary of adopting any policy that might have the unintended consequence of becoming a veterinary fix rather than a more salutary repairing of the ability to propagate jobs.\n\nIt is no secret that I thought the second round of quantitative easing (QE2) ran that risk. I could not support it when it was proposed because I saw no analytically sound justification that its purported benefits would outweigh its likely costs. Similarly, at our last meeting, I felt that the benefit of stating that the FOMC anticipates economic conditions were likely to warrant holding the base rate at “exceptionally low levels … at least through mid-2013” was outweighed by the risk that such an action would be viewed as a commitment. The majority of the FOMC felt that anchoring the fed funds rate where it is for two years would assure markets and incent business activity. I felt doing so would, instead, give job-creating companies, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses, an incentive to further delay borrowing for expansion, given that they feel stymied both by anemic demand and discomfort with how they are taxed and regulated. It seemed to me that signaling that money would likely remain cheap for two years or more would hardly induce those with access to credit to borrow to expand and add to payrolls now.\n\nThis discomfort was compounded for me by the confusion and disorienting uncertainty arising from the debacle of the debt ceiling negotiations that took place shortly before the FOMC meeting—an uncertainty that has yet to be resolved. Moreover, it struck me that such a stance risked creating a perception that the FOMC might be a little bit trigger-happy in reacting to short-term developments in the securities markets; that we were collectively signaling there was a readily available “Bernanke Put.”\n\nThe press and the Street are currently brimming over with assumptions about new fixes. Market operators are, to varying degrees, pricing in probabilities of one or more of the following: further expansion of our balance sheet; an “Operation Twist,” wherein we lengthen the duration of our portfolio so as to drive down already historically low nominal intermediate and longer-term rates (rates that are below 2 percent all the way through the 10-year range and have negative yields in real terms); reducing from 25 basis points to zero what we pay on excess reserves (though the banks that deposit these reserves with us reportedly aren’t able to identify a sufficient number of willing borrowers or believe they need a cushion to deal with regulatory concerns).\n\nThe Federal Reserve has done a great deal to reverse the situation that we confronted in 2008 and 2009. As I have said repeatedly, we have filled the gas tanks of the economy with affordable liquidity. What is needed now is for employers to confidently step on the pedal and engage the transmission that will use that gas to move the great job-creating machine of America forward.\n\nSources of Uncertainty\n\nThat confidence is not lacking because of U.S. monetary policy. It is, however, my firm opinion that confidence is being significantly undermined by at least two sources of uncertainty.\n\nOne is domestic. It arises from the fiscal and regulatory authorities. Congress and the president must put together a program that will encourage growth in final demand as soon as possible by incentivizing private businesses to do what they do best to make growth in final demand possible: Expand investment, hire workers and go about the business of lifting the income and net worth of the American people. Yet, they must do so without running afoul of the need to reverse the downward spiral of the nation’s finances. To this end, I am encouraged that the president and the Congress are going at it hammer and tong, searching to find the right balance between goosing up the economy short term and reining in the long-term fiscal imbalances that are imperiling our nation’s future.\n\nThe second source of uncertainty has largely emanated from the European debt crisis, which intensified in the spring of 2010. At that time, risk spreads jumped, and both securities prices and confidence retreated. This helped derail the momentum that the economy had built up in late 2009 and early 2010. The sovereign debt crisis has reintensified, as you are all aware, and risk premiums in bond and stock markets are rising once again. Another global factor that undermined the pace of recovery this year, of course, was the disruptive earthquake in Japan and the economic aftershock from this tragedy.\n\nIt is hard for domestic monetary policy to offset such effects, both because they are external in nature and because it is unclear how long they will dampen the U.S. recovery. One thing is for certain: Given the effects of banking crises on economic recoveries and the interconnectedness of financial markets, it is imperative that our European partners resolve their banking issues if we are to sustain a prolonged economic upturn.\n\nThis is not to say that the Federal Reserve has no role to play. Our franchise includes assuring an efficient financial transmission mechanism. For example, everyone acknowledges that small business is the originator of jobs and the incubator of our nation’s prosperity. In addition to wanting to see the whites of the eyes of growing final demand, needing clarity on fiscal policy and wanting regulatory relief, many of the small businesses that Dunk [Bill Dunkelberg] represents—and others that we survey—will need better access to the abundant and cheap liquidity the FOMC has made possible. Small businesses turn to community and regional banks for credit; their credit activity does not move the needle on the dashboards of the megabanks. It is incumbent on the Fed and other bank regulators to reduce the regulatory burdens that are inhibiting—indeed, overwhelming—community bankers whose business it is to lend to creditworthy small businesses. This is a supervisory and regulatory matter, not a matter of general monetary policy. My point is that the Fed needs to examine and perfect the transmission mechanism under its purview just as intensely as it looks at monetary policy per se.\n\nAnd we must be ever-mindful that the central bank cannot carry the load alone, as Chairman Bernanke and others of us have often said. Indeed, there is great danger in any temptation to do so. A recent Economist article aptly summarized my perspective on this as follows: “Above all, there is a moral hazard in central-bank activism. It risks encouraging governments to sit back and let others do the work that they find too difficult themselves.”[2]\n\nIf I believe further accommodation or some jujitsu with the yield curve will do the trick and ignite sustainable aggregate demand, I will support it. But the bar for such action remains very high for me until the fiscal authorities do their job, just as we have done ours. And if they do, further monetary accommodation may not even be necessary.\n\nWith that, I’ll stop. And in the best tradition of central banking, I’d be happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

        "content": "August 17, 2011 Midland, Texas\n\nThank you, Kirk [Edwards]. It is great to be here in the cool climes of Midland, Texas.\n\nI appreciate your having walked our friends today through the operations of the Dallas Fed. You know as chairman of our El Paso Branch board that we operate a well-run business as we provide services to the American people that only a central bank can provide, from making sure you have folding money, to lending to our community and regional banks, to supervising and regulating bank and thrift holding companies so as to protect depositors. As president and CEO of the Dallas Fed, I am responsible for a $100 billion bank, accountable to a board of local directors. That board is chaired by Herb Kelleher (you Midlanders will appreciate that Herb’s immediate past predecessors were Jim Hackett, president and CEO of Anadarko Petroleum, and Ray Hunt) and consists of eight other citizens of our district; I am also advised by the private-sector directors of the El Paso, San Antonio and Houston branches of our bank.\n\nI am not appointed by a president of the United States or subject to confirmation by the U.S. Senate. I, along with the 11 other Federal Reserve Bank presidents, operate the business of the Federal Reserve as efficiently as any bank in the private sector. And as Kirk mentioned, we make money for the U.S. taxpayer: We returned over $125 billion to the U.S. Treasury in 2009 and 2010. You are looking at one of the few public servants that make money from its operations, rather than just spending taxpayer money. This wouldn’t be possible without a first-rate staff, led by my chief operating officer, Helen Holcomb, and the other senior officers that Kirk introduced. I love and admire these folks and too rarely get to single them out for public praise. So, please join me in applauding them.\n\nTwo Matters\nAs Kirk has already said much of what I planned to say today about how the Fed works, I would like to address two non-operational matters.\n\nFirst is the record of job creation in Texas. For obvious reasons, this has become a subject of intense interest to the national media; my staff and I are being hounded by the national press corps for data and commentary. Today I will try to separate fact from fiction, with a heavy focus on the data.\n\nThe second matter I wish to address is why I dissented from the consensus at the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe two would appear to be unrelated, but might well be—though not in a manner that would be readily apparent. I will conclude by trying to connect the two dots.\n\nTexas’ Record of Job Creation\nHere is a chart that displays nonagricultural employment growth by Federal Reserve Districts over the past 21½ years, using the employment levels of 1990 as a base of 100 and tracing job creation through June.\n\n\n\nTo illustrate a point, I am going to separate out three districts: the Second, headquartered at the New York Fed and consisting of New York, southwestern Connecticut, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and a dozen counties in New Jersey; the Eleventh, represented by the Dallas Fed, made up of Texas, the wooded areas of northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico; and the Twelfth, or the San Francisco Fed’s district, which consists of California, eight other states, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and Guam. The state of New York produces 72 percent of the economic output of the Second District; Texas accounts for 95 percent of the Eleventh District’s output; and California accounts for 62 percent of the Twelfth District’s output. One might consider this second chart to be an imperfect but reasonable proxy for the employment growth over the past two decades of the three largest states in the country.\n\n\n\nLike the chart for employment in all 12 of the Fed’s districts, the three districts’ employment levels are indexed to 100 in 1990. You will see that, at the end of June, the index stands at 150 for the Eleventh District, 125 for the Twelfth and 103 for the Second. Nonagricultural employment growth in Texas has compounded at an annual rate of 1.95 percent over 21½ years; that of California at 0.57 percent; and New York’s at 0.19 percent. If you are interested in the output of their workers over this same period, the compound annual growth rate of Texas GDP is 3.6 percent; California’s is 2.59 percent; and New York’s 2.06 percent.\n\nNow, let’s look at job creation in Texas since June 2009, the date that the National Bureau of Economic Research (or NBER, the body that “officially” dates when a recession starts and ends) declared the recent economic recession to have ended.\n\nThere are several ways to calculate Texas’ contribution to national job creation from June 2009 through the end of June 2011. One is to look at the number of jobs created by all 50 states, including those that have lost jobs since the nation’s anemic recovery began. Using this metric, through June of this year Texas has accounted for 49.9 percent of net new jobs created in the United States.\n\nAnother way to calculate Texas’ contribution to job creation is to lop off those states that have continued losing jobs and consider only those that have positive growth in employment these past two years. Using this metric, Texas has accounted for 29.2 percent of job creation since the recession ended.\n\nThese are the facts. You may select whichever metric you wish. Regardless, it is reasonable to assume Texas has accounted for a significant amount of the nation’s employment growth both over the past 20 years and since the recession officially ended.\n\nThis raises the obvious question—what kind of jobs are being created in Texas? Here are two charts that might help you form an opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first provides a breakdown of employment growth by sector since the recession ended, listing each employment sector by its weight in the employment mix of Texas. The most jobs have been created in the educational and health services sector, which accounts for 13.5 percent of Texas’ employment. The second-most jobs have been created in the professional and business services sector, which accounts for 12.5 percent of the Texas workforce. The mining sector, which includes support activities for both mining and oil and gas, employs 2.1 percent (yes, two-point-one percent) of Texas’ workers. In the second chart, you will see that these jobs are not low-paying jobs. The average weekly wage in the education and health services sector is $790; in the professional and business services sector it is $1,117; and in the mining sector, the average weekly wage is $2,271. Together these three sectors account for 68 percent of the jobs that have been created in Texas in the past two years.\n\nI should point out that in 2010, 9.5 percent of hourly workers in Texas earned at or below the federal minimum wage, a share that exceeds the national average of 6 percent. California’s share was 2 percent and New York’s was 6.5 percent. Texas and New York do not have a state minimum wage that is higher than the federal minimum wage.[1] At least 17 states do have minimum wages that are above the federal level of $7.25; California’s minimum wage, for example, is $8.\n\nThe agricultural sector has a relatively high share of minimum wage workers. Approximately 2 percent of Texas’ workers are in the ag sector, whereas 1.1 percent of California’s workforce and a mere 0.5 percent of New York’s workforce are employed in agriculture. This is true especially in the border area, which also has many migrant workers and where the level of education is relatively low. Finally, Texas has a younger workforce than the nation, further boosting the share of minimum wage earners in the state. For example, the leisure and hospitality sector employs a disproportionate number of young people, and the average weekly wage in that sector is a very low $347.\n\nSo those are the facts. The Dallas Fed will henceforth be providing monthly updates on employment in Texas through our website at www.dallasfed.org. We hope it will be a useful tool for everyone ranging from columnists who write for the New York Times to the pundits who provide commentary for Fox News, as well as serious economists.\n\nFOMC Decision\nNow to the second matter I wish to discuss with you today: my decision to dissent from the commitment of the majority of my colleagues on the FOMC in their decision to hold the base interest rate for interbank lending—the fed funds rate, the anchor of the yield curve—at its current level well into 2013.\n\nI have posited both within the FOMC and publicly for some time that there is abundant liquidity available to finance economic expansion and job creation in America. The banking system is awash with liquidity. It is a rare day when the discount windows—the lending facilities of the 12 Federal Reserve banks—experience significant activity. Domestic banks are flush; they have on deposit at the 12 Federal Reserve banks some $1.6 trillion in excess reserves, earning a mere 25 basis points—a quarter of 1 percent per annum—rather than earning significantly higher interest rates from making loans to operating businesses. These excess bank reserves are waiting on the sidelines to be lent to businesses. Nondepository financial firms—private equity funds and the like—have substantial amounts of investable cash at their disposal. U.S. corporations are sitting on an abundance of cash—some estimate excess working capital on publicly traded corporations’ books exceeds $1 trillion—well above their working capital needs. Nonpublicly held businesses that are creditworthy have increasing access to bank credit at historically low nominal rates.\n\nI have said many times that through the initiatives we took to counter the crisis of 2008–09, and the dramatic extension of the balance sheet that ensued, the Fed has refilled the tanks needed to fuel economic expansion and domestic job creation. Though I questioned the efficacy of the expansion of our balance sheet through the purchase of Treasury securities known as “QE2,” I have come to expect that the Federal Open Market Committee would continue to anchor the base lending rate at current levels and also maintain our abnormally large balance sheet, now with footings of almost $2.9 trillion, for “an extended period.”\n\nI do not believe it wise to commit to more than that, or to signal further accommodation, when the cheap and abundant liquidity we have made available is presently lying fallow, and when the velocity of money remains so subdued as to be practically comatose. At the FOMC meeting, the committee announced that it “currently anticipates that economic conditions … are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.” In monetary parlance, that is language designed to signal that we are on hold until then.\n\nI voted against that commitment-cum-signal. In the press’ reporting of my dissenting vote and those of the other two members of the FOMC who voted against that commitment—Mr. Kocherlakota, my counterpart from the Minneapolis Fed, and Mr. Plosser, my counterpart from Philadelphia—there was substantial speculation as to the reasons for our dissent. I will let my other two colleagues speak for themselves; I can only speak for myself. Let me make clear why I was opposed to freezing the fed funds rate for two years.\n\nFirst, in reporting my views to the committee, I noted my concern for the fragility of the U.S. economy and weak job creation. It might be noted by the press here today that although I am constantly preoccupied with price stability—in the aviary of central bankers, I am known as a “hawk” on inflation—I did not voice concern for the prospect of inflationary pressures in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean analysis of the inflationary developments in June indicated that the trimmed mean PCE turned in its softest reading of the year. The trimmed mean analysis we do at the Dallas Fed focuses on the price movements of personal consumption expenditures. It is an analysis that tracks the price movements of 178 items that people actually buy, such as beer, haircuts, shoe repair, food and energy prices. In June, the trimmed mean came in at an annualized rate of 1.3 percent, versus 2.1 percent for the first five months of the year. The 12-month rate was 1.5 percent.\n\nMy concern is not with immediate inflationary pressures. Core producer prices are still increasing at a higher than desirable rate. But I have suggested to my colleagues that while many companies have begun and will likely continue to raise prices to counter rising costs that derive from a range of factors—including the run-up of commodity prices in 2010 and increases in the costs of production in China—weak demand is beginning to temper the ability of providers of goods and services to significantly raise prices to consumers.\n\nMy concern is with the transmission mechanism for activating the use of the liquidity we have created, which remains on the sidelines of the economy. I posit that nonmonetary factors, not monetary policy, are retarding the willingness and ability of job creators to put to work the liquidity that we have provided.\n\nI have spoken to this many times in public. Those with the capacity to hire American workers—small businesses as well as large, publicly traded or private—are immobilized. Not because they lack entrepreneurial zeal or do not wish to grow; not because they can’t access cheap and available credit. Rather, they simply cannot budget or manage for the uncertainty of fiscal and regulatory policy. In an environment where they are already uncertain of potential growth in demand for their goods and services and have yet to see a significant pickup in top-line revenue, there is palpable angst surrounding the cost of doing business. According to my business contacts, the opera buffa of the debt ceiling negotiations compounded this uncertainty, leaving business decisionmakers frozen in their tracks.\n\nI would suggest that unless you were on another planet, no consumer with access to a television, radio or the Internet could have escaped hearing their president, senators and their congressperson telling them the sky was falling. With the leadership of the nation—Republicans and Democrats alike—and every talking head in the media making clear hour after hour, day after day in the run-up to Aug. 2 that a financial disaster was lurking around the corner, it does not take much imagination to envision consumers deciding to forego or delay some discretionary expenditure they had planned. Instead, they might well be inclined to hunker down to weather the perfect storm they were being warned was rapidly approaching. Watching the drama as it unfolded, I could imagine consumers turning to each other in millions of households, saying: “Honey, we need to cancel that trip we were planning and that gizmo or service we wanted to buy. We better save more and spend less.” Small wonder that, following the somewhat encouraging retail activity reported in July, the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment released just recently had a distinctly sour tone.\n\nImportantly, from a business operator’s perspective, nothing was clarified, except that there will be undefined change in taxes, spending and subsidies and other fiscal incentives or disincentives. The message was simply that some combination of revenue enhancement and spending growth cutbacks will take place. The particulars are left to one’s imagination and the outcome of deliberations among 12 members of the Legislature.\n\nNow, put yourself in the shoes of a business operator. On the revenue side, you have yet to see a robust recovery in demand; growing your top-line revenue is vexing. You have been driving profits or just maintaining your margins through cost reduction and achieving maximum operating efficiency. You have money in your pocket or a banker increasingly willing to give you credit if and when you decide to expand. But you have no idea where the government will be cutting back on spending, what measures will be taken on the taxation front and how all this will affect your cost structure or customer base. Your most likely reaction is to cross your arms, plant your feet and say: “Show me. I am not going to hire new workers or build a new plant until I have been shown what will come out of this agreement.” Moreover, you might now say to yourself, “I understand from the Federal Reserve that I don’t have to worry about the cost of borrowing for another two years. Given that I don’t know how I am going to be hit by whatever new initiatives the Congress will come up with, but I do know that credit will remain cheap through the next election, what incentive do I have to invest and expand now? Why shouldn’t I wait until the sky is clear?”\n\nBased on past behavior of fiscal policy makers, businesses understandably regard the debt ceiling agreement and the political outcome of negotiations between Congress and the president with the suspicion akin to how the British humorist P.G. Wodehouse regarded his aunts: “It is no use telling me there are bad aunts and good aunts,” he wrote. “At the core they are all alike. Sooner or later, out pops the cloven hoof.”[2]\n\nIt will be devilishly difficult for businesses to commit to adding significantly to their head count or to meaningful capital expansion in the United States until clarity is achieved on the particulars of how Congress will bend the curve of deficit and debt expansion and the “cloven hooves” are revealed. No amount of monetary accommodation can substitute for that needed clarity. In fact, it can only make it worse if business comes to suspect that the central bank is laying the groundwork for eventually inflating our way out of our fiscal predicament rather than staying above the political fray—thus creating another tranche of uncertainty.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I should add that I was also concerned that just by tweaking the language the way the committee did, our action might be interpreted as encouraging the view that there is an FOMC so-called “Bernanke put” that would be too easily activated in response to a reversal in the financial markets. For those of you unfamiliar with the expression “Bernanke put,” or more generally, a “central bank put,” this term refers to the concept that a central bank will allow the stock market to rise significantly without tightening monetary policy, but will ease monetary policy whenever there is a stock market “correction.” Given the extent of the drop in the stock market leading up to and following Standard & Poor’s downgrade of U.S. debt, combined with the FOMC’s commitment to hold short-term rates near zero until mid-year 2013, some cynical observers might interpret such a policy action as a “Bernanke put.” My long-standing belief is that the Federal Reserve should never enact such asymmetric policies to protect stock market traders and investors. I believe my FOMC colleagues share this view.\n\nConnecting the Dots\nNow, how do you connect the dots between Texas’ record of economic growth and my dissenting vote?\n\nDespite the fact that Texas has severely limited social services and an education system that faces great challenges, people and businesses have been picking up stakes and moving to Texas in significant numbers over a prolonged period.[3] It should be noted that in the last census, Texas gained population and congressional seats, while California’s population growth and congressional representation was static and New York’s was diminished. Jobs have been created for American workers in Texas in several different sectors, not just in the oil and gas and mining sectors. People have taken those jobs of their own free will, even though the jobs may not measure up to the compensation levels everyone would like. And yet Texas, like all states, is subject to the same monetary policy as all the rest: We have the same interest rates and access to capital as the residents of any of the other 49 states, for the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy and regulates financial institutions under its purview for the nation at large. From this, I draw the conclusion that private sector capital and jobs will go to where taxes and spending and regulatory policy are most conducive to growth.\n\nTherein lies a lesson for our fiscal policy makers as they grapple with their monumental task of reconfiguring fiscal policy and eliminating the prevailing uncertainty about their remedy.\n\nWe live in a world that, through steadfast sacrifice of the American treasure and with blood and capable diplomacy, won the Cold War, induced the Chinese to pull back the Bamboo Curtain and opened up the majority of the world to once unimaginable economic opportunity. China, the rest of Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, India, most of Latin America and significant swathes of Africa are eager to improve the lot of their people through full participation in the global economy. In doing so, they have become serious competitors for capital, including that plentiful and affordable capital we at the Federal Reserve have created.\n\nIn a cyberized, globalized world, those with the means to create jobs will gravitate to those places that provide the best prospect for a return on the investment of the abundant capital on business’ balance sheets or available to them in the marketplace or from eager bankers. Just as many people and firms within the United States have relocated to Texas from other states, investment will flow to countries anywhere in the world where it is most welcome.\n\nOur fiscal authorities must not only figure out the way to contain the nation’s runaway deficits and public debt accumulation, but they must do so in a manner that is competitive with others who seek access to our money, and do so in a manner that does not pull the rug out from under the meager recovery we are experiencing. The Committee of 12 and the president have an awesome task. Essentially, they must reboot our entire system of economic incentives and come forward with an updated tax and spending and regulatory regime that incentivizes businesses to invest in the United States and create jobs for American workers rather than gravitate to foreign shores. And they must do so in a manner that avoids engaging in a race to the bottom, but rather, puts us back on the path to ever higher achievement of prosperity.\n\nThe sooner they get on it, the better. Uncertainty is corrosive; it is hurting job creation and capital expansion when we need it most. As Margaret Thatcher would say: “Don’t dawdle. And don’t go wobbly on us, Congress.” Monetary policy cannot substitute for what you must get on with doing. Get on with your job.\n\nThe Ugly Truth\nI think I have made it pretty clear today that I believe what is restraining our economy is not monetary policy but fiscal misfeasance in Washington. We elect our national leaders to safeguard our country. An integral part of that consists of safeguarding the nation’s fiscal probity. Pointing fingers at the Fed only diminishes credibility—the ugly truth is that the problem lies not with monetary policy but in the need to construct a modern, appropriate set of fiscal and regulatory levers and pulleys to better incentivize the private sector to channel money into productive use in expanding our economy and enriching our people. Only Congress, working together with the president, has the power to write the rules and provide the incentives to correct the course of the great ship we know and love as America. I hope you, as the voters who put them in office, will demand no less of them.\n\nThank you. I will be happy to do my level best to avoid answering any questions you might have.",

        "content": "July 13, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nThank you, Jim [Struble], for that kind introduction.\n\nIt is always a pleasure to speak to Rotarians. Until I went to Washington in 1997 to serve as the deputy U.S. trade representative, I was a member of this wonderful downtown club. I especially loved the patriotism and the esprit de corps that characterize every meeting. I have always considered Rotarians the Marine Corps of the civic community. Remember what Ronald Reagan said about the Marines? &ldquo;Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they have made a difference. The Marines don&rsquo;t have that problem.&rdquo; Neither do Rotarians.\n\nNor do they have a problem injecting a little humor to lighten the load of the day. When I was a member of this great club, Carol Reed used to read the &ldquo;news&rdquo; at the beginning of every meeting, picking subjects not ordinarily reported in the traditional media. One of her most memorable reports was about a man who had fallen into a river in Egypt and had allegedly managed to fight off an attack by a 14-foot crocodile. The punch line, of course, was that if you didn&rsquo;t believe a man could fend off a croc with his bare hands, then you yourself were in &ldquo;de-Nile.&rdquo;\n\nWe are no longer in denial about our national economic plight. Our great country now finds itself in a very difficult predicament. It is true that the situation here in Texas is relatively better than that of the nation; Texas is an oasis in a national economic desert devoid of life-giving job creation. We went into the Great Recession last and were one of the first to come out. As we have for the past 20 years, we continue to outpace the rest of the United States in employment growth by a significant margin. Since the Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, only North Dakota (a plucky state whose hearty population totals less than that of Collin or Denton counties) has seen faster job growth than Texas.[1] As I speak, Texas has almost as many people employed as we did before the recession began. Our banks are in better shape than those in the rest of the country; we are benefiting from the blessings of nature, with copious amounts of oil and gas and abundant agricultural production; our fellow citizens have seen to it that our Legislature continues to hew to a tax, regulatory and legal environment that attracts job-creating investment and encourages business formation and growth. And yet, even in this blessed state, there are too many unemployed and underemployed, just as there are in the rest of America. We can do better. America must do better.\n\nThe question is: How?\n\nTo create employment, we must have economic growth.\n\nThe simplest of econometric equations posits that the key components of economic growth are domestic consumption, plus foreign demand for U.S.-produced exports, plus investment by businesses, plus spending by government.\n\nI think it is pretty clear to everyone who lives on the planet that in order to grow our economy and put our people back to work, we must rely on our ability to curry to domestic and foreign consumption and invest here at home to produce the goods and services to sell in the marketplace. You&rsquo;d have to be from Mars to believe that the federal and state governments will be the source of much direct spending stimulus to the economy.\n\nPresently, all eyes are focused on the budget negotiations in Washington as the debt-ceiling clock ticks on. Aesop&rsquo;s classic fable comes to mind. Rather than work like ants to build and store for difficult times, our fiscal authorities&mdash;Congress after Congress, under Republican and Democrat leadership alike, and with presidents of both parties occupying the White House&#8213;have been proverbial grasshoppers. Except for a few interludes, they have partied along for decades using the people&rsquo;s money as though life were an endless summer, storing nothing to draw upon for the blustery fall and the bleak winter that inevitably follow. Now a fiscal reckoning is upon us. The gig is up. Congress can no longer carry on as before, oblivious to the deleterious effect of spending our, and the successor generations&rsquo;, money with unfunded abandon.\n\nTongue firmly in cheek, Carol Reed might have reminded us that there are alternative versions of this fable. In 1924, Somerset Maugham wrote a version about two brothers: one an ant-like hard worker and the other a grasshopper wastrel. In the end, the grasshopper marries a rich widow who dies and leaves him a fortune.[2] Case closed! In Things Change, a film released by Columbia Pictures in 1988, the character played by Don Ameche recites a version in which the grasshopper, fed up with all this moralizing about the virtues of hard work and saving for a rainy day, just up and eats the ant.\n\nI think we can safely assume that neither of these scenarios will occur. No one is going to bail out the government at the last minute. The ants that are the hard-working taxpayers are, if anything, poised to chew up and spit out improvident politicians should they fail to put an end to fiscal profligacy. The fiscal authorities have no choice but to come to terms with the need to bring about a better balance between taxes and spending and to not only bend the curve, but reverse the inexorable growth in federal debt accumulation. This is the stuff of the great negotiations taking place among the executive branch and the two houses of Congress.\n\nThis is no small chore. The parties involved must stop the hemorrhaging without inducing cardiac arrest; they must solve the long-run debt and deficit problem without, in the short run, pushing the economy back into recession, creating still more unemployment. And they must not only confront their addiction to debt and spending beyond their means, but they must reorganize the tax system, redirect the money they collect and rewrite the regulations they create so as to be competitive in a world that wants to beat us at our own game.\n\nThis is an essential point. It will not be enough to reach a deal on the debt ceiling or on partially reining in deficits. In the post-Cold War, post-Bamboo Curtain world, there are many governments and great swathes of people outside the United States that want to attract investment and improve their lot. We are being challenged as the place to invest job-creating capital. Our fiscal and regulatory authorities do not operate in a vacuum; we live in a globalized, interconnected world where money is free to go to wherever it earns the best return. In their solution to the debt crisis, our political leaders must develop an entirely new structure of incentives for private businesses and investors to put their money to work creating jobs here at home.\n\nOnly fiscal authorities have the power to affect this outcome. Monetary authorities, like me and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve (FOMC), have limited influence. We can fill the gas tank with attractively priced fuel&#8213;abundant and cheap money&#8213;needed to propel the economy forward. But we cannot trigger the impulse to step on the pedal and engage the transmission mechanism of job-creating investment by the private sector. This is the province of those who write our laws and regulations&#8213;the Congress of the United States.\n\nI firmly believe that the Federal Reserve has already pressed the limits of monetary policy. So-called QE2, to my way of thinking, was of doubtful efficacy, which is why I did not support it to begin with. But even if you believe the costs of QE2 were worth its purported benefits, you would be hard pressed to now say that still more liquidity, or more fuel, is called for given the more than $1.5 trillion in excess bank reserves and the substantial liquid holdings above the normal working capital needs of corporate businesses. Even surveys of small businesses&mdash;most recently, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce&rsquo;s survey of companies with less than $25 million in sales and fewer than 500 employees&mdash;indicate that fewer than 10 percent of small enterprises (which employ half of the private sector&rsquo;s workers) are having problems accessing credit.[3] The National Federation of Independent Business specifically noted just yesterday that &ldquo;91 percent [of those surveyed in June] reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing.&rdquo;[4]\n\nU.S. banks and businesses are awash in liquidity. Adding more is not the answer to our problems.\n\nWith monetary policy having reached the limits of accommodation, and the federal government at sixes and sevens, what then is the foreseeable economic outlook? Are we going to grow through the rest of the year and on into the next, or are we going to dip back into recession?\n\nForecasting economic growth is not a precise business. Economics is an art form, not a science; it is very judgmental and subjective. The FOMC is composed of 17 thoughtful, introspective and deliberate men and women. Five of the members serve full time in Washington as Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, appointed by presidents of the United States with the approval of Congress. The remaining 12, like me, are chosen by nine-member, nonpolitical boards of directors of citizens in their districts and charged with conducting the business of the Fed in the field based on our business acumen and with developing policy insights based upon what we see, hear and measure on Main Street. Together, the 17 of us formulate policy with the best judgment we can collectively muster, free from political pressures or the passions of the moment, on what is in the best long-term interest of the country&rsquo;s economy.\n\nWe each gin up forecasts for the economy. All 17 FOMC participants&rsquo; expectations for the economy through 2013 and beyond were released to the public yesterday and widely reported in the press today.[5] To develop those forecasts, we employ sophisticated econometric models, study the entrails of numerous comprehensive surveys conducted all across the nation&#8213;like the Dallas Fed&rsquo;s Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey and the Texas Retail Outlook Survey and their counterparts in other Federal Reserve districts&#8213;and draw upon input from our boards of directors, numerous advisory boards and contacts with businesses and stakeholders nationwide and worldwide. These forecasts are helpful guideposts, but they must be kept in context.\n\nKenneth Arrow, one of the most notable Nobel Laureates in economics, has his own perspective on forecasting. During World War II, he served as a weather officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps and worked with a team charged with the particularly difficult task of producing month-ahead weather forecasts. As Arrow and his team reviewed these predictions, they confirmed statistically what you and I might just as easily have guessed: The Corps&rsquo; weather forecasts were no more useful than random rolls of a die. Understandably, the forecasters asked to be relieved of this seemingly futile duty. Arrow&rsquo;s recollection of his superiors&rsquo; response was priceless: &ldquo;The commanding general is well aware that the forecasts are no good. However, he needs them for planning purposes.&rdquo;[6]\n\nKeep Ken Arrow in mind when you hear economists tout precise forecasts carried out several places to the right of the decimal point. You may need economists&rsquo; forecasts for planning purposes, but you should always take them with a grain of salt, even when the time horizon is a short one. I will direct you to an article in the Feb. 14 Wall Street Journal as evidence. The Journal had polled 51 leading economists, and they forecast that gross domestic product (GDP) would expand 3.6 percent in that very same first quarter.[7] Growth came in at 1.9 percent.\n\nWhen economists forecast we will have growth of, say 3.6 percent, remember they are saying .036. It is an elaborate conceit to think anybody can be that precise in an economy as large as that of the United States, operating as it does within the context of an even larger, very dynamic, global economy. This is true for Fed economists as well as academics and those who sell their forecasts for a living.\n\nThis is not to say that we will cease and desist from making &ldquo;point&rdquo; forecasts. But what matters most to me is the direction in which the numbers are headed and the general sense of momentum. At this juncture, I think it sufficient to say that, assuming the people we elect to tax us and spend our money and create the rules and regulations that govern our economic behavior can at long last get their act together, confront their own denial of most rudimentary budgetary discipline, learn to shoot straight and remove the Damocles Sword of uncertainty that they have for too long unwittingly wielded over our job-creating private sector, there is plenty of potential for the economy to move forward at an accelerating clip. This is especially the case now that the Fed has reliquified the economy.\n\nI expect that economic activity will accelerate in the second half of this year, with real GDP likely to rise at an average annual rate of between 3 and 4 percent. Lest you get carried away with excitement, I must note that some of the acceleration in activity will be a function of inventory adjustment, and much will stem from an unwinding of the disruption caused by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami as the Japanese make up for supply interruptions to the auto and other industries faster than many thought possible. Looking beyond 2011, I hope that growth above 3 percent can be sustained, again assuming the fiscal authorities get it right.\n\nAs Jim has referenced, I may have called the bottom of the recession in the summer of 2009 well before most anybody else did, but I made the point in that Dallas Morning News interview that going forward, we were going to have a slow slog.[8] I have said many times since then that, in light of the fact that we were recovering from &ldquo;post-traumatic shock syndrome&rdquo; stemming from the Panic of 2008 and 2009, economic recovery would proceed hesitantly, taking two steps forward and one step back until it finds its new legs. We took a step backward in the first half; I expect we will proceed forward, however haltingly, in the second half and into 2012.\n\nThe point is that I do not think we need be stuck in the low gear of the first half. Some of the temporary influences that I believe retarded growth in the first half&#8213;high gasoline and unprocessed-food prices, the supply disruptions in Japan, etc.&mdash;are passing through the system and are either being reversed or digested. To be sure, some businesses are being hit with higher input costs from imported goods and other nonlabor cost increases. Having become as lean as possible and having learned to preserve their margins by years of tight cost management and by maximizing productivity, they don&rsquo;t have much fat to absorb the cost of input increases. If input price increases continue or spread, these businesses will naturally attempt to pass them on to consumers, who are wary of anything else that will compress their living standards.\n\nI see a bit of a tug-of-war developing here. The issue will be whether businesses can exercise pricing power in the face of fallow consumer demand. As an inflation &ldquo;hawk&rdquo;&#8213;I prefer to think of myself and my 16 colleagues, hawks and doves alike, as wise owls&#8213;I am watching this very carefully. If I see inflation continuing to rise and, most importantly, inflationary expectations beginning to spread, I will be the first out of the box to advocate the removal of the substantial monetary accommodation now in place. I cannot think of anything more damaging to the welfare of hard-working Americans who have jobs, those who are unemployed and barely eking out a living, retirees who are earning minimum returns on their savings, or any consumer already stretched thin, than to have their purchasing power reduced by still higher inflation.\n\nYet even though I am a central banker and am professionally disposed to being a worrywart, I am more optimistic about the economic outlook than the consensus. American businesses and workers have made very important improvements in their efficiency and competitiveness that will aid growth. If we can add to that a sound long-run budget deal, the recovery could gain even more strength. We are a resilient people. I know it is fashionable to think we have somehow been infected with an economic stasis with no way out, but as a Texan and an American, I am culturally unable to accept that view.\n\nDuring the Q&amp;A that followed a recent speech of mine abroad&#8213;in New York&#8213;a questioner cited the sickly economic pace of the first quarter and then recited the consensus view that very weak growth will likely ensue for the rest of the year and beyond. In response, I cautioned that forecasting based on current trends can be very misleading. And the consensus view&#8213;usually conveyed with confidence all the way out to three places to the right of the decimal point&#8213;is almost always wrong, even within short time periods.\n\nI asked my interlocutor to recall the presidential election of 1948. The consensus view called for a landslide victory by Gov. Dewey. Indeed, an early edition of the Chicago Daily Tribune on the very night of the election announced in the boldest of headlines that Dewey had won. Before going to sleep, an overconfident Dewey is reported to have turned to his wife and said, &ldquo;Just think about it: Tomorrow night, you are going to be sleeping with the president of the United States!&rdquo;\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, Mrs. Dewey asked, &ldquo;Am I going up to Washington this evening or is Harry Truman coming to our house?&rdquo;\n\nCarol Reed would love to have reported that story!\n\nThank you, Rotarians. You are the embodiment of what makes this country great. Carry on with your good works.",

        "content": "June 16, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nI am here today not simply to say bienvenido and welcome you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas with un fuerte abrazo, but to underscore the importance I attach to our achieving a better understanding of the Hispanic economic experience and, very importantly, the potential for greater Hispanic advancement within the U.S. economy.\n\nLet me cut to the quick: Hispanics are underachieving in our society, especially in Texas. Here are the data:\n\nThose are some basic facts. Here are some others for you to consider:\n\nFor the past 20 years, the Eleventh Federal Reserve District―in which 96 percent of the economic output is generated by Texas―has outgrown the rest of the Federal Reserve districts and the United States by significant margins. We have grown our real―or inflation-adjusted output (real state gross domestic product)―by 3.6 percent compounded over 20 years, whereas the rest of the U.S. (real gross domestic product) has grown at 2.5 percent compounded; annual job growth in Texas has outpaced the nation by 1 percentage point a year; population growth within Texas has compounded over the past two decades by 2 percent per annum, versus 1.1 percent for the rest of the nation.\n\nWe now have the second-largest Congressional delegation in the country behind California. But the growth dynamic here is vibrant, whereas that of California is stagnant. This is why we are picking up population and Congressional seats, while the recent U.S. census apportioned no additional seats to California.\n\nIn sum, we are a vibrant and strong economy. The economic tenor in California and the rest of America is weary, if not downright weak: Somos fuerte; los otros son flojos. Since the recent economic recession ended, Texas has been responsible for 48 percent of all the jobs created in America.\n\nAnd yet, the Hispanic population is not participating in our economic prosperity in proportion to its weight in the Texas census.\n\nThe unemployment rate among Latinos here is substantially higher than it is for non-Hispanic Texans. Hispanics earn 36 percent less in hourly wages than non-Hispanic whites; median household income of Latino-headed households in Texas is about 60 percent of median household income of non-Hispanic households. For the U.S. as a whole, Latino-headed households earn about 73 percent of non- Hispanic white household income.\n\nPia Orrenius and our other economists are hard at work in deciphering what accounts for the differences between the economic status of Texas Hispanics and Latinos elsewhere in the U.S. Already, one factor is clear: Hispanic educational achievement in Texas is abysmal.\n\nIn Texas, as anywhere else in the United States and in all capitalist societies, “you earn what you learn.” Every study known to man, and plain common sense, tell you that income is directly correlated to educational attainment. High school graduates earn significantly more than high school dropouts; a college degree results in greater lifetime earnings than a high school degree; the highest income groups are those with graduate degrees.\n\nNearly 50 percent of Texas public schoolchildren are Hispanic, but only 38 percent of high school graduates are Hispanic.\n\nSome 54 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 48 percent of non-Hispanic blacks age 18 to 24 with a high school degree were in college in 2008. The percentage of Hispanics was only 43 percent.\n\nWithin the age cohort between 25 and 64, only 14 percent of native-born Texas Latinos have college degrees; 23 percent of native-born Hispanics in Texas age 25 to 64 are high school dropouts.\n\nNo matter how you slice it or dice it, it is glaringly clear that Hispanics in Texas are failing at school. This must be corrected. If not, they will continue to trail in economic achievement. And all of us―white, black, Asian-American, Hispanic or non-Hispanic―will suffer the consequences of economic underperformance.\n\nTexas is a remarkable place. We embody the “can do” spirit. My favorite Texas historian is T.R. Fehrenbach. I recommend his book, Lone Star: A History of Texas and the Texans, to anybody who wishes to understand what makes this place unique.\n\nAs Fehrenbach puts it, the key to overcoming the odds in the Lone Star State has been that “the Texas ethic and Texas society rewarded enterprise,” ... “work was the real virtue.” … “We chose this land; we took it; we made it bear fruit.” We are a people, in Fehrenbach’s words, for whom “the cult of courage was obvious.”[1] And he distills the Texas spirit that prevails to this day in one sentence: Here, “men who exist get overrun by men who act.”[2]\n\nIt is time for our great Latino population to have the courage to face the facts: They must do a better job as families and within their communities to dedicate themselves to educational achievement. And it is time for all Texans, Hispanics and non-Hispanics, to act to create the conditions that will safeguard and nourish the prosperity of all our children and that of our children’s children.\n\n¡Ándale pues! Delve into the Hispanic experience. Help us understand through this conference and your various studies how to advance Hispanic prosperity. For in doing so, you are helping us advance Texas and the nation.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "June 6, 2011 New York, N.Y.\n\nThank you for that kind introduction. This discerning audience no doubt noted that despite being overeducated, I am not a formally trained economist. I do not have a Ph.D. in economics; those who do will correctly deduce that I am somewhat “dismal” in comprehending the arcana of “the Dismal Science.” After my undergraduate education in economics and my studies at Oxford, I took a different path. I earned an MBA and then went to Wall Street and into funds management before cashing out and taking to public service. My perspective on monetary policy and regulation is shaped less by theory and more by my experience as a market operator.\n\nI confess that in matters of monetary policy and regulation, I am often in the minority. This does not make me the least bit uncomfortable. The majority opinion is not always right; indeed, my experience as an investor has biased me to conclude that more often than not, the consensus view is the wrong view, even among the most erudite. Exhibit A of the fallibility of consensus thinking is the herd mentality among supposedly sophisticated financiers as well as theoretical economists who believe in efficient-markets theory and other nonsense themes that led us into the recent financial crisis. I happen to believe that Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, was right when she said, “You cannot lead from the crowd.”[1] There is a role for contrarians, not just in the investment arena, but also at the highest level of policymaking; at a minimum, it is important to question and challenge consensus views, even when they are formed by the most credentialed individuals.\n\nFor example, some of you may recall the public letter written by 364 eminent economists predicting disastrous consequences that would result from Thatcher’s policy initiatives. That letter was published in the Times of London on March 30, 1981.[2] The British economy began a recovery almost immediately afterward, in 1982; by 1983, inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels in over a decade, while economic growth accelerated. The failure of the consensus view led Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe to define an economist as “a man who knows 364 ways of making love, but doesn't know any women.”[3]\n\nTo be sure, economic theories and econometric models are of great utility for providing a framework for policymaking; we cannot make policy without them. But they are imperfect substitutes for common sense. The late New York intellectual Irving Kristol is reported to have said: “Don’t fall for fantastical notions that have nothing to do with the way people really are.”[4] My experience of having worked in real time in the financial markets leads me to a different perspective on financial operators and markets than that of most of my colleagues at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This not only affects my views on the implementation of monetary policy, but also shapes my perspective on regulation.\n\nMonetary policy and regulation are intricately linked. When conducting its monetary policy, the Fed is governed by a dual mandate: creating the monetary conditions to foster maximum employment growth while constraining inflation and its alter ego, deflation. These goals cannot be realized without financial stability that results from effective regulation. As the FOMC now sets its sights on concluding the accommodative monetary policy it fashioned to stave off financial collapse and deflation, our supervision and regulation team is wrestling with developing the appropriate policy for dealing with the lingering effects of the financial crisis, and, most importantly, erecting a new regulatory framework to substantially reduce the chances of financial crises. Or at least make them more manageable, should one occur again. (In all candor, it would be more historically accurate to say “when one occurs again,” because crises and panics have occurred repeatedly throughout history, including three times just in my own career: the mid-1970s, the late 1980s and just recently).\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s efforts to revamp the regulatory framework are being led by Governor Tarullo, who is providing focused, important leadership on this critical matter.[5] The revamping.is largely shaped by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd–Frank”), which became law last summer. The act establishes a new regulatory infrastructure for promoting financial stability. Among its most prominent macroprudential features is the Financial Stability Oversight Council, an interagency body charged with detecting and deterring threats to the financial system. The act also establishes an Office of Financial Research, a mechanism for the orderly winding down of failing financial firms, and new responsibilities for the Federal Reserve in overseeing certain nonbank financial companies and certain payment, clearing and settlement utilities. The Federal Reserve Board is also directed to develop enhanced prudential standards for large banking organizations and systemically important nonbank financial firms.\n\nDodd–Frank itself mostly provides only high-level direction, leaving an extraordinary number of details and critical decisionmaking to regulatory discretion. As a result, the ultimate nature and future of reform rest in the hands of regulators. As many of you are aware, the various regulatory agencies are presently seeking public comments on a range of issues involving implementation of Dodd–Frank.\n\nMost regulatory reform initiatives applied since the Banking Act of 1864 have missed the mark. They looked good on paper and appeared to solve the problems of the day but later proved not up to the task. This is especially true with efforts to solve the “too big to fail” problem, in which an unwillingness to follow through on prior policy commitments to actually close down large failures and impose losses on their uninsured creditors has led to what economists call “time inconsistency” in policy. Let’s hope this time will be different, that regulators will make their commitments credible and consistent with future rather than past needs.[6]\n\nHaving come from the financial industry, I take a keen interest in these issues, and I hold some strong opinions as to how we should proceed. I believe there are leverage points for effective reform. There are areas where, if regulators act decisively, they might have profound positive effects and avoid time inconsistency. Conversely, there are other areas where regulatory action would at best generate small benefits and, in the worst case, might actually be counterproductive.\n\nThe key to successful reform will be to identify the leverage points that exist and do our best to ensure regulators are up to the task in those areas while not burdening other aspects of the financial system with heavy intervention that might trigger the law of unintended consequences.\n\nEye on Target\n\nLet us be clear about the goals of reform. With so much energy being expended on the what, the when and the how of implementing Dodd–Frank, the first risk we run is forgetting the why—the reasons for the act, its primary goals.\n\nFor this, we need only turn to the law itself, the preamble, which spells out the key objectives as follows: “To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail,’ to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices and for other purposes.”[7] On the subject of too big to fail, the legislation is quite blunt. The Conference Report summary of the legislation’s key provisions, provided in plain English by the Senate Banking Committee, states that it seeks to end “the possibility that taxpayers will be asked to write a check to bail out financial firms that threaten the economy by: creating a safe way to liquidate failed financial firms; imposing tough new capital and leverage requirements that make it undesirable to get too big; updating the Fed’s authority to allow system-wide support but no longer prop up individual firms; and establishing rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses.”[8]\n\nWhile there is much to criticize about Dodd–Frank, I cotton to those blunt statements on ending too big to fail. For, if after the myriad rules and regulations are written and implemented we have not eradicated too big to fail from our financial infrastructure, reform will have failed yet again.\n\nI have spoken to this topic on several occasions.[9] If you pull up a copy of the Sept. 28, 2009, Wall Street Journal, you will find an article I wrote with my colleague Harvey Rosenblum about the interference too big to fail poses for the effective conduct of monetary policy. In looking at regulatory reform and implementing Dodd–Frank, I think a key point worth repeating is that the distinction between “commercial banks” and “the shadow banking system” is a false one. The two became intertwined beginning with the bypassing of Glass–Steagall strictures by Sandy Weill and Citicorp and the deregulatory initiative of Gramm–Leach–Bliley. The fact is that the largest commercial banks played a major role in many of the more problematic phenomena of the recent credit boom and ensuing crisis, including the spread of what I have previously referred to as financial STDs, or securitization transmitted diseases.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Panic, these viruses linger. Last week, the New York Times printed an interesting article by Joe Nocera, who drew upon the observations of a highly regarded regional banker from Buffalo, Robert Wilmers of M&T Bank.[10] Wilmers claimed that of the $75 billion made by the six largest bank-holding companies last year, $56 billion derived from trading revenues. Nocera noted that “in 2007, the chief executives of the Too Big to Fail Banks made, on average, $26 million … more than double the compensation of the top nonbank Fortune 500 executives.” A recent survey conducted for the Wall Street Journal of CEO compensation at 350 public companies shows that financial services compensation has been tempered; the rate of increase in compensation for 2010 was just 1 percent.[11] The Journal attributed this to higher levels of scrutiny of financial firms as well as pressure from shareholders and regulators. Even so, some financial-sector CEOs enjoyed robust increases in their total compensation, including a 74 percent increase and a 51 percent increase at two of the five largest U.S. banking organizations. Interestingly, the trading revenue of these two firms accounted for almost half of the $56 billion in total trading revenue mentioned by Mr. Wilmers. These recent numbers buttress Nocera’s reasonable conclusion that bank CEOs “were being compensated in no small part on their trading profits—which gave them every incentive to keep taking those excessive risks.”\n\nI am sympathetic to these concerns. I have no problem with risk takers being rewarded with large compensation packages. I put my own and my partners’ capital at risk for the 20 years I operated in the markets and profited handsomely. But I never was provided with capital that was safeguarded by government guarantees. There is no logic to having the public underwrite through deposit insurance or subsidize through protective regulation the risk-taking ventures of large financial institutions and their executives. There is a substantial case to be made for separating the “public utility”—or traditional core function of banking—from the risk-taking function.\n\nTo be sure, financial problems are not limited to large institutions and their complex, opaque and conflicted operations. Regional and community institutions that have, for the most part, stuck to the public utility function have faced their own difficulties, especially in the context of construction lending. But while over 300 banks failed during the crisis, another 7,000 did not. Community and regional banks that are not too big to fail appear to have succumbed less to the herdlike mentality and promiscuous financial behavior that affected their megabank peers.\n\nMoreover, when smaller banks got into deep trouble, regulators generally took them over and resolved them. In the treatment of big banks, regulators, for the most part, tiptoed around them. Failing big banks were allowed to lumber on, with government support, despite the extensive damage they wrought. Big banks that gambled and generated unsustainable losses received a huge public benefit: too-big-to-fail support.\n\nPostcrisis, the large institutions are even larger: The top 10 now account for 64 percent of assets, up from 58 percent before the crisis and substantially higher than the 25 percent they accounted for in 1990. In effect, more prudent and better-managed banks have been denied the market share that would have been theirs if mismanaged big banks had been allowed to go out of business. This strikes me as counter to the very essence of competition that is the hallmark of American capitalism: Prudently managed banks are being victimized by publicly subsidized competition from less-prudent institutions.\n\nA student of existentialism is tempted to recall Nietzsche’s lament that, “He who is punished is never he who performed the deed.”[12] An acerbic devotee of H.L. Mencken might be given to recite his dictum that while “injustice is relatively easy to bear; what stings is justice.”[13] I do not doubt for a New York minute that the savvy big players who “performed the deed” did so with confidence they would be protected by the authorities who might find “justice” difficult to impose. In solving the crisis at hand during the Panic, it appears that the most imprudent of lenders and investors were protected from the consequences of their decisions; the sinners were rescued and the virtuous penalized. In crafting regulations in response to Dodd–Frank, we need to restore market discipline in banking and let the market mete out its own brand of justice for excessive risk-taking rather than prolong the injustice of too big to fail.\n\nIt is not difficult to see where this dynamic, if uncorrected, will lead—to more pronounced financial cycles and recurring crises. I would argue that the failure to reform the banking system in Japan was one of the principal reasons for that country’s “Lost Decade(s).” We must not let that pathology take hold here.\n\nMaking Matters Worse\n\nIf we do not keep this ultimate goal of reform firmly in mind, our rule making not only might fail to promote the original objectives of reform, but could actually work against them. Ironically, with Dodd–Frank, such a perverse outcome is a distinct possibility.\n\nThe Dodd–Frank law entails the writing of more than 200 proposals and rules covering a host of issues—risk-based capital requirements, ability-to-pay requirements for home mortgages, protections for consumers sending remittances to foreign countries and so on. The Congress decided the need for these rules to be written, drawing on the input of many, including some very thoughtful economists. Here, I think it wise to draw upon the insight of the classical liberal Frédéric Bastiat in his take on unintended consequences. Bastiat opined, “There is only one difference between a bad economist and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.”[14] The same might be said of regulators. As regulators grapple with implementation of the voluminous Dodd–Frank reform act, the unforeseen must be taken into account. The law of unintended consequences is always lurking in the shadows. To get regulatory reform right, we have a lot of “foreseeing” to do.\n\nOne can envision, for example, that the potential cumulative impact of the many regulations demanded by Dodd–Frank will be to artificially raise the cost structure of the non-too-big-to-fail depository institutions. Imposition of the new requirements and restrictions risks creating new economies of scale in banking generated by the costs of regulatory compliance, many of which could be fixed costs not fully proportional to bank size.\n\nTo the extent that a large scale becomes necessary to absorb the regulatory cost associated with reform, Dodd–Frank could intensify the tendency toward bank consolidation, resulting in a more concentrated industry, with the largest institutions predominating even more than in the past. Such an outcome would appear to me contrary to the stated spirit and goal of the act. A more consolidated industry would only magnify the challenge of dealing with systemically important institutions and offsetting their historically elevated too-big-to-fail status.\n\nMy concerns over regulation-induced economies of scale and the implications for industry consolidation apply to all the size classes of banks, given the extensive list of new or enhanced requirements created by Dodd–Frank and their associated compliance costs. As it affects community banking, my concerns are tempered somewhat, though not completely alleviated, by the small-bank exceptions that have been granted to several of the new law’s more costly requirements.\n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot yet be said for the case of regional banks. The act indicates that all banking organizations with more than $50 billion in assets should be subject to enhanced supervision. Some of the related regulatory proposals have already been distributed for comment. Still other proposals for new, stricter “enhanced supervision” rules for these banks will be unveiled soon.\n\nYet, few really believe a $50 billion bank poses a systemic threat to our $17 trillion banking system. Nor is a $50 billion bank qualitatively similar along risk dimensions to the very largest ones that exceed $2 trillion in size. The top 10 banking organizations have a cutoff point of $300 billion. I posit that this group should constitute the primary target for enhanced supervision. Interestingly, despite its large share of industry assets, this group holds only about 20 percent of the small-business loans on bank books. Clearly, these institutions are engaged in substantial activities outside the traditional banking role. It is within these very largest banks, and perhaps a few slightly smaller yet highly complex or interconnected ones, that systemic risk is concentrated.\n\nIf the enhanced-supervision requirements are not highly graduated and imposed primarily on the very largest banks, it is not difficult to imagine how the costs associated with such supervision could lead mid-tier banks that exceed the $50 billion threshold—yet fall well short of megabank status—to seek merger partners in order to achieve sufficient scale by which to help cover the cost of regulation. This would compound the problem rather than alleviate it.\n\nWith regard to enhanced standards for such important factors as capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits and risk management, Dodd–Frank instructs regulators to differentiate among these banks. Enhanced supervision can be implemented on a graduated scale, based on the extent of assets beyond $50 billion and possibly other factors. Let us do that fully, then, applying these measures along a highly graduated scale, with only minimal added mandates directed at mid-tier banking organizations.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the top 10 or so, I would apply Dodd–Frank extensively and vigorously. I would apply all the elements of heightened supervision—from enhanced standards for capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits and risk management to the additional measures of living wills and credit-exposure reports, concentration limits, extra public disclosures and short-term debt limits—with full force.\n\nTo this we would add robust annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve, along with the additional tools and procedures of macroprudential supervision, including in-depth horizontal reviews across large companies.\n\nConclusion\n\nI trust regulators will rise to the challenges posed by the financial crisis and too big to fail, leaving a legacy of success and providing a practicable infrastructure for next-generation supervision and regulation.\n\nI quoted Bastiat’s criterion for a good economist as one who accounts for “effects that must be foreseen.” Economists did not do a good job of foreseeing the financial crisis. Neither did regulators. Moreover, previous measures directed at containing too big to fail proved ineffective, with no one too surprised that when crisis came, many large-bank counterparties were protected under implicit guarantees. Let’s hope that going forward, regulators can do better, avoiding both unintended consequences and time inconsistencies. For if they don’t, and they are unable to solve the too-big-to-fail issue in a timely manner, we will ultimately have to take more draconian measures and simply break up the largest banking organizations to eliminate the threat they pose to financial stability and economic growth.\n\nThat is my contrarian view, and I’m sticking with it.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

        "content": "May 4, 2011 Las Cruces, New Mexico\n\nThank you, President [Barbara] Couture, for that kind introduction. It is an honor to speak at New Mexico State University.\n\nI will keep my comments as brief as possible this afternoon so as to leave ample time for Q&A. I want to first provide the précis of the analysis of the nation’s economy that I presented to the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) last week on behalf of the 27 million citizens of the 11th District of the Federal Reserve System, including the citizens of Las Cruces and southern New Mexico. Second, I will discuss inflation as we see it at the Dallas Fed. But before getting into these weighty matters, let me demystify the Federal Reserve System and the Dallas Fed’s role within that System.\n\nIf you look closely at the face of any $1 note, you will see a letter in the middle of the left side. Every $1 bill bears the imprint of one of the Federal Reserve Banks, starting with the “A” of the Boston Fed and ending with the “L” of the San Francisco. Dallas Fed dollars are identified by the letter “K,” surrounded by two concentric circles. The outer circle says “Federal Reserve” and “Texas,” and the inner circle says “Bank of” and “Dallas.” “K” is the 11th letter in the alphabet—in all four corners of the bill are printed the number “11.” The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas is responsible for the administration of the Federal Reserve’s affairs in the 11th of 12 Federal Reserve Districts that were set up by Congress under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Presently, there are nearly $1 trillion worth ($903 billion to be exact) of Federal Reserve notes in circulation. (Of course, you know that Dallas Fed dollars are of greater nominal value than the others!)\n\nThe economic activity conducted within the Eleventh District—which includes roughly 27 million people and covers some 360,000 square miles in southern New Mexico, Texas and the wooded north of Louisiana—is serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and its three branches.\n\nI am the president and CEO of a $98 billion bank. That bank operates at a profit—a profit that we send to the Treasury. Indeed, the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, collectively, transferred approximately $79 billion to the Treasury in 2010. You are looking at an individual affiliated with one of the few public agencies that actually pay down the federal deficit.\n\nWhat do we do for those 27 million people in the Eleventh District? For starters, we make sure they have the cash they need. In the first quarter of this year, the Dallas Fed distributed and received almost 1.5 billion circulating banknotes, worth nearly $27 billion at face value. Our mammoth machines scan the cash at an average rate of around 100,000 bills per hour and process them so they can be shipped from our vaults in El Paso, Houston and Dallas to banks throughout our district, providing you and the other citizens in our district with folding money. Of course, in addition to making sure there is a sufficient amount in circulation, we have to make sure your folding money is valid and looks respectable: Each month, we cull hundreds of counterfeit bills, and we pluck out about 36 million worn bills that have lived a full life and are ready to be shredded, sent off to money heaven and replaced by new, crisp notes.\n\nBeginning this year, the Dallas Fed no longer processes checks. (In 2009, we processed 120 million paper checks.) Since the use of paper checks has been, and will continue to be, on a substantial decline as consumers and businesses take up electronic counterparts, the Federal Reserve Board decided to consolidate all paper–check processing with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. (After the loss of LeBron James, losing paper–check processing would have been too much for the city to handle.) The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta will serve as the sole electronic–check processing site for the entire System.\n\nAnother important function of the Dallas Fed is to provide liquidity to district depository institutions through our discount window operations—in other words, to be the ultimate banker’s bank. Those of you in this room who are at all affiliated with depository institutions are certainly aware of this vital function. The lending programs that make up our discount window help relieve liquidity strains by providing a source of short–term funding, which is fully secured and collateralized, to depository institutions to help them conduct uninterrupted business on behalf of you and their other customers. In 2009, we made 594 loans approximating $30 billion, and in 2010, we made 156 loans for about $3 billion. I chair our credit committee and personally review the loans we make every evening. Their size and structure depend on the needs of the borrowing bank.\n\nAmong our other responsibilities is supervising the banking industry within our district. We conduct on–site audits of our state–chartered member banks and bank holding companies and monitor bank performance and stability using electronic surveillance technologies. Currently, we supervise 37 “state member” banks and 522 bank holding companies, ranging from more than $50 billion to less than $20 million in total assets. In June of this year?thanks to the Doddâ??Frank bill?we will take on the responsibility of supervising savings and loan holding companies. We currently have 92 of them in our district.\n\nThis supervisory role is important. I began my private–sector career at the bank of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., where my superiors instilled in me one overarching principle—one I’m sure the bankers in this room know quite well: Know your customer. Well, we at the Fed rely upon our regulatory relationship to better know our customers, actively monitoring our constituents’ needs and services on the front line of the commercial banking industry and using this insight to be better lenders to all our customers. Without that supervisory and regulatory responsibility, we could not operate effectively as the nation’s lender of last resort. Moreover, the knowledge gained through banking supervision aids the formation of monetary policy.\n\nThe Dallas Fed also organizes public education programs designed to raise financial and economic literacy in our community. We frequently host public events and conferences on significant activities within our economy. Not unimportantly, we work with universities and high schools throughout our district. Our team at our El Paso Branch, for example, works with students in New Mexico State University’s Doctor of Economic Development Program, which allows students to participate in internships at the branch. We have partnered with New Mexico State University to sponsor the Collegiate Advisory Board?an independent study program?and we have developed a Student Board of Directors program for the top high school students for the Las Cruces school district.\n\nCurrency processing, banking supervision, lending as a banker’s bank and public education efforts are integral parts of the Federal Reserve’s job. But you wouldn’t know it if you read the papers: They are not the parts of central banking that usually garner the most public attention. The sexier bits of what I do—to the extent anything in central banking is considered sexy—deal with monetary policy.\n\nThe presidents of the 12 Fed Banks, in addition to the five governors of the Federal Reserve Board (two shy of normal, thanks to a holdup in the nomination and confirmation process), normally meet every six weeks to discuss the current trajectory of the economy and craft the appropriate policy response. We do so in a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, commonly known as the FOMC. It is in these meetings that we set the base interest rate for interbank lending known as the federal funds, or “fed funds,” rate and where we develop other monetary policy initiatives, like the various programs we put in place to restore liquidity in the commercial paper and mortgage and other markets during the recent financial crisis.\n\nI come to each FOMC meeting armed with input from a research team that provides the intellectual heft for informed monetary policy making, as well as insights provided by board members, including Laura [Conniff] and Cindy [Ramos–Davidson], and the many businesses—large and small—that populate my district and with whom I constantly consult. The Dallas Fed employs a crack team of economists and analysts who study the local, national and international economies. Their work is top–notch. Few of you might know, for example, that Finn Kydland, an advisor to our research team in Dallas for the past 15 years, won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2004.\n\nThe FOMC is one of the few public service decisionmaking bodies in the world where members can come together and, in the span of only a few hours, present their positions without fear of political retribution and without posturing for the cameras, then hammer out agreement on a course of action based solely on what they solemnly consider judicious for the long–term health of the economy rather than for political convenience. On the afternoon in which we conclude our discussion, we craft a statement for public release explaining the actions taken. We release a lengthy set of minutes of our deliberations three weeks after our meeting.\n\nThe FOMC is where Texas and the parts of Louisiana and New Mexico that we cover have a voice at the policymaking table for the most powerful and essential central bank in the world. The president of the United States appoints and the Senate confirms the governors of the Federal Reserve System. The 12 Federal Reserve bankers like me who sit side by side with those governors are not subject to that process. We are hired and fired by nine–member boards of directors that represent the financial institutions and stakeholders and economic diversity of our respective districts. I want to make this clear: I am not accountable to any Washington politicos, be they Democrat or Republican. I am politically neutered, devoutly nonpartisan and guided solely by what I believe is the best way to craft policy so as to encourage sustainable economic growth with price stability, regardless of who is in the White House or the Congress. I work hard to represent the views and ideals of my part of the country. My fellow Bank presidents and I represent Main Street, not the Washington or Wall Street establishment. I want you to know that every time I speak or intervene in our policy discussion at the FOMC—which is quite often (I am, after all, a Texan)—I do so very much with that in mind.\n\nEconomic Overview\n\nWhich brings me to our current economic situation.\n\nDespite being hit with a variety of shocks last year and early this year, the economy continues to recover. Last year, concerns over the euro debt crisis and uncertainty over health and financial reform slowed the economy’s momentum during the summer. But the economy shook off those drags and reaccelerated late last year, reflecting a combination of policy stimulus and the ability of the U.S. economy to reinvigorate itself. More recently, bad winter weather and an increase in energy prices have sapped some steam from the recovery. Nevertheless, a host of more timely indicators suggest that economic growth will likely pick up in coming months.\n\nThe recovery in manufacturing and a bounceback in capital goods orders are particularly heartening. Not only do they contribute toward an economic recovery, but they are also harbingers of a needed rebalancing of our economy. During the credit boom of the prior decade, we became too dependent on consumption and housing for our economic growth. We borrowed too much, had unsustainable trade deficits and did not invest enough in business capital. The good news today is that we are making headway in shifting the mix of growth in our economy.\n\nOur manufacturing sector is recovering as we export more and as our entire economy invests more in equipment and software. In the long run, that will raise our productivity and our living standards. And that’s the kind of recovery that not only will restore jobs, but also will be more sustainable and will help bolster our standard of living.\n\nPrice Stability\n\nShifting to prices, we have seen inflationary impulses gaining ground both at home and abroad. An astute reader of today’s Wall Street Journal would have noted the article on page A12.[1] It reported the data released yesterday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development?the OECD?showing that consumer prices in its 34 member countries rose 2.7 percent in the last 12 months, driven largely by food and energy prices. Of note, industrial producer prices in the European Union rose 6.7 percent year–over–year?the steepest annual increase since September 2008, just as the financial panic broke the back of the inflationary thrust that had been gaining steam throughout the summer of that year. At the core of the euro zone, Germany, where unemployment is actually lower than before the financial crisis, wage inflation is pressing up against 3 percent. Retail price inflation in the United Kingdom now exceeds 5 percent, despite very high unemployment. Reported inflation now exceeds 5 percent in China, 6 percent in Brazil and 10 percent in India.\n\nIn this country, as many of you have experienced firsthand, higher energy and commodity prices have reduced the purchasing power of many households. According to the latest readings, headline inflation increased at an annualized rate of 4.9 percent in March after clocking in at 5.1 percent in February.\n\nNumbers like these will make any central banker’s heart skip a beat, especially mine. Yet, here and abroad, a closer look at these numbers will reveal that energy and food prices?notoriously volatile items?make up a significant portion of this increase. This is not to say that these increases are unimportant; they are clearly worrisome, and we are following them closely. But our job as policymakers is to focus on underlying inflationary pressures, so as to avoid overemphasizing temporary volatility that might lead to faulty conclusions about the economy.\n\nThe question one should ask is: What is the best method to measure future inflationary trends? Headline inflation, important as it is in measuring the rise in someone’s cost of living, accurately characterizes past inflation but is not as informative as one might think for predicting future inflation. For that?counterintuitive as it might seem?it helps to exclude some of the more volatile components. This is why central bankers around the world pay such close attention to underlying measures rather than the headline number. Underlying price movements are more useful in predicting future inflationary trends.\n\nWe at the Dallas Fed came up with a separate and distinct way of calculating core inflation, called the trimmed mean analysis. Developed by senior economist Jim Dolmas, this measure looks at the price movements of 178 personal consumption expenditure items that matter to average consumers in a series that goes back to 1977. We then strip away both the highest and lowest monthly price increases for categories of goods and services to get at the underlying trend. This “trimmed–mean inflation rate” has become a key component in my economic toolkit, allowing me to better gauge the direction and speed of approaching inflationary winds.\n\nOver the past six months, the trimmed–mean inflation rate, while rising, has run at a somewhat sedate rate of 1.3 percent, though it has risen from a low of 0.7 percent in mid–2010. The 12–month inflation rate rose from a low of 0.8 percent in the second half of 2010 to 1.1 percent most recently. These numbers excluded items with extreme price increases, such as gasoline and many food items. We also trimmed out items with extreme price declines, such as toys, natural gas and wine. Among the items that were included to ascertain the underlying trend of prices were physician services, rent, tobacco, dining out, the costs of life and health insurance, sporting goods, guns and ammunition and child care costs. As the son of an Australian, I noted that the median item?the one smack in the middle?was beer! I also noted that the number of falling items in the basket has been declining to what has been a historically normal level of about 30 percent of items people consume. This trend in the number of items actually declining in price has been in place for a while, which is what convinced me early on that the risk of deflation was not as high as some of my other colleagues at the FOMC surmised.\n\nThe point is that, as of now, the higher gas and commodities prices have not translated into more general price inflation numbers. My gut, however, tells me that we must not become complacent on this front. We know from anecdotal soundings that American businesses, like businesses in other countries, are doing their utmost to offset with higher prices the surging costs of inputs such as fuel, other commodities and materials, and components, parts and processes sourced from abroad. As Chairman Ben Bernanke mentioned in his inaugural press conference last week, our job is to keep these from passing into prices and wages throughout the economy and creating a broader inflation. Such a result would be much more difficult, and painful, to extinguish.\n\nWe are committed to keeping inflation low and maintaining the credibility gained so painstakingly by former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. I will remain steadfast in my resolve to keeping inflation low and stable. In monetary parlance, I am known as an inflation hawk?a description with which I am comfortable. As I have pointed out many times, ornithologists classify doves as being from the pigeon family, and I do not wish to be anybody’s pigeon. Nor am I alone in my firm commitment to keeping inflation under control. As Chairman Bernanke commented last week, if we are going to have success in creating a long–run sustainable recovery with lots of job growth, we must keep inflation under control. I am confident in our ability to do so.\n\nSo, bottom line: With regard to the economy, like the music of Wagner, the pace of economic growth may not be as bad as it sounds. With regard to inflation, like gangsta rap, it may not be as good as it sounds.\n\nTo counter the recession and ward off the risk of deflation, the Federal Reserve has provided a great deal of stimulus to the economy in the past few years. In my view, we have done as much as we can to supply the liquidity needed to restore economic growth. Now, as Ben Bernanke made clear in his press conference last week, we must remain sharply attuned to movements of underlying inflationary forces. Should it prove necessary to counter inflationary pressures, I will be among the first to advocate the unwinding of some of the stimulus we have provided and returning monetary policy to a more normal stance.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve System.",

        "content": "April 8, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nIn the fall of 2006, I was asked to draw upon some 30 years of experience in Germany and speak at the American Academy in Berlin, addressing the question: “Is Germany’s Decline Exaggerated or Inevitable?”[1] This was against the backdrop of reforms that had been initiated by the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and carried on by his successor, Angela Merkel. I argued that Germany’s economic fate and position as primus inter pares in Europe was at a tipping point. The answer to the question of whether Germany was fated for decline or ascent depended upon how Germans would adapt their education system, labor laws, health care system, financial infrastructure, corporate governance, tax regime and myriad other changes needed to advance their economic competitiveness in a world being transformed by the forces of globalization and cyber-ization. I ended that speech by saying I was encouraged that changes had been initiated, but drew on St. Peter and Calvin Coolidge, neither of whom would have considered themselves economists, to underline the essential ingredient for success in these critical initiatives. For it was St. Peter who urged, “Be serious and discipline yourselves.”[2] And it was Silent Cal who said, “Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. …The slogan ‘press on’ has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.”\n\nTwo weeks ago, I was back in Germany. My interlocutors there, having been serious, determined and persistent in implementing change and who are now sitting rather pretty, turned the question back on me, asking: “Is America’s Decline Exaggerated or Inevitable?” I thought I would speak to that question today.\n\nFor those of you who are impatient, the answer is: “It depends.” It depends not upon the outcome of the conflicts in North Africa and the Middle East, nor upon the effect of the tsunami and the disruption of nuclear facilities in Japan, nor upon any of the other pressing issues of the moment that are the subject of day-to-day angst assiduously reported by your colleagues in the press.\n\nIt depends upon monetary and fiscal policy.\n\nIt depends upon whether the United States can get its economic house in order.\n\nIt depends, in the end, upon whether the Federal Reserve, as the nation’s central bank, and the Congress, working with the executive branch in discharging its duty as the nation’s fiscal authority, will adhere to the maxims of St. Peter and President Coolidge—whether each of these institutions has the will to be serious and discipline itself, and be persistent in pressing on with their respective duties.\n\nMonetary Policy\n\nI’ll start with the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn contemplating future policy of the Federal Reserve, it is important to remember the frightful predicament we faced in the fall of 2008. The financial gears of our economy—the most powerful and important economy in the world—had ground to a halt. The entire panoply of markets for financial instruments essential to the daily lives of businesses and individual citizens—interbank lending, commercial paper, asset-backed lending, money-market mutual funds and the mortgage markets—seized up. In the blink of an eye, liquidity and trust in financial counterparties disappeared. In those darkest of days, a colleague of mine wittily summed up what had transpired by noting that on the balance sheets of the most important financial institutions, “nothing on the right is right and nothing on the left is left.”\n\nWe could have an endless discussion of who was responsible for this so-called black swan scenario. We would likely agree that it resulted from a combination of factors, including the speculative excesses that occur when interest rates remain too low for too long; the consequences of systemically important bank and financial intermediaries embracing risk-management tools that are formulaic and dependent upon “quant jocks” rather than upon common sense and good judgment; the abuses that ensue when regulatory authorities let down their guard; the comeuppance that inevitably occurs when policymakers and their advisers are lulled into complacency with theoretically comforting, but nonsensical, shibboleths like “efficient markets”; or just the financial tomfoolery that disturbingly repeats itself at periodic intervals throughout history when, in the memorable words written in 1856 by the English essayist Walter Bagehot, “[A]t particular times … people have a great deal of … money…. At intervals … the money of these people … is particularly large and craving: it seeks for some one to devour it, and there is [a] ‘plethora’; it finds some one, and there is ‘speculation’; it is devoured, and there is ‘panic.’”[3]\n\nRegardless of how it came to be, when the Panic of 2008 occurred, the Fed did what central banks are called to do when pandemonium strikes: As the lender of last resort, we stepped into the breach, used the powers given to us by our government to create money and credit, and deployed the considerable array of tools at our disposal to calm and restore the financial markets.[4]\n\nThe Bernanke-led Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had confidence in the programs we undertook, for they were well-vetted, disciplined and carefully considered. We persisted with them even though our actions gave rise to great consternation and warnings of bleak consequences from an understandably anxious Congress, skeptical financial pundits and frightened citizens. Teddy Roosevelt once said, “When people lose money, they strike out unthinkingly, like a wounded snake, at whoever is most prominent in the line of vision.”[5] The Fed—as the nation’s central bank and first responder to a financial crisis—was front and center in dealing with the panic, and we felt the sting of a rattled public and its elected representatives. Still, we “pressed on.”\n\nWe now know that the exigent measures we undertook worked. The end result of the Fed’s efforts was that the credit markets and the lifeblood of liquidity needed to conduct commerce and sustain the economy were restored. The economy responded and began a recovery in the middle of 2009 that is slowly gaining steam and now appears to be self-sustaining.\n\nImagine that! A government agency that (a) devised programs that actually worked, (b) shut most of them down when they had done their job and (c) made money for the taxpayer in the process.\n\nThis is not to say there was no cost to what we accomplished. There were trade-offs and unintended consequences, some of which were distinctly unpleasant.\n\nIn saving the system, for example, it can be argued that we protected imprudent lenders and investors from the consequences of their decisions; we rescued sinners and penalized the virtuous.\n\nPostcrisis, the “too big to fail” financial behemoths that had placed our economy in jeopardy have ended up with even greater financial power. (And, adding insult to injury, by the grace of their shareholders, most of their leaders retain their posts and few, if any, have suffered financial setbacks). This concentration of power comes at the expense of community and regional banks, an imbalance that the Federal Reserve and other authorities must now address through tough-minded, clear-eyed regulation.\n\nAt the individual citizen’s level, we eased the pain of overextended homeowners with mortgages by buying up $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and driving mortgage rates to historic lows. The Fed’s interventions to drive interest rates to historically low levels resulted in significant capital gains for bondholders and equity investors in the most plain-vanilla securities and mutual funds. Yet, by taking interest rates to zero and making money cheap and abundant so as to reliquefy the economy, those who invested the most conservatively—tucking their savings away in the safest of vehicles, like CDs, money market funds, and Treasury bills and notes—saw the income earned on their hard-earned savings dramatically reduced.\n\nI personally fret over these and other costs, but on net, I believe the Federal Reserve did what is expected of a responsible central bank: We stemmed a panic and averted a depression.\n\nWhile we have wound down most all of our exigent programs, we remain with a bloated balance sheet, with footings in excess of $2.4 trillion, roughly triple the size of our precrisis balance sheet. And the composition of our balance sheet has changed: We hold about $937 billion in mortgage-backed securities and over $1.3 trillion in Treasury securities, including those of longer duration than is typical.\n\nWhen we buy an interest-bearing security from the market, we pay the seller of that security. This expands liquidity in the system. Whereas in the Panic there was no liquidity, today our large-scale asset purchases have made for abundant liquidity. Banks have $1.4 trillion in excess reserves parked in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks; other financial intermediaries are flush with cash; there is a surfeit of cash on the books of corporations and nonfinancial businesses, and more is available at little cost through a robust bond market and a fully recovered stock market.\n\nPersonally, I felt the liquidity needed to propel our economy forward was sufficient even before the FOMC opted last November to buy $600 billion in additional Treasuries on top of the committee’s pledge to replace the runoff of our $1.25 trillion mortgage-backed securities portfolio. I argued as much at the FOMC table. I considered the risk of deflation and of a double-dip recession to have receded into the rearview mirror. In fact, I gave an interview to my introducer here, Mr. [Brendan] Case, that was published under his byline in the Dallas Morning News on Aug. 26, 2009, in which I said the recession was over and the long slog of recovery from the Great Recession had begun.[6] Last November, I felt the problem was not the lack of liquidity in the economy, but that regulatory and fiscal uncertainty—the handiwork of fiscal authorities and lawmakers, not the Fed—was inhibiting the deployment of that liquidity into job creation. I also worried that these simultaneous programs would have the effect of buying up—of “monetizing”—the equivalent of most all of the U.S. government’s issuance of new debt through June of this year, a dangerous course for any central bank to embark upon.\n\nThe majority of my colleagues on the FOMC felt differently, and the committee voted to initiate the program now known as QE2. Whether you feel that we are providing a prudent amount of liquidity, as they do, or too much, as I do, I think you would be hard-pressed to dispute that there is now plenty of fuel in the tanks of American businesses to finance expansion and put unemployed and underemployed Americans back to work.\n\nHaving done our job, I see many risks to the Fed overstaying its welcome.\n\nThere are perceptional risks, for example. Our duty is most distinctly not to monetize—or even be perceived as monetizing—the debt of fiscally imprudent government. Throughout the history of nations, monetizing the budgetary excesses of governments has proven to be a direct path to economic perdition. Having already peeked inside that door, I feel strongly that we must now shut it, lock it and throw away the key.\n\nThere is the risk that we might breach our duty to hold inflation at bay. Inflationary impulses are gaining ground in the rest of the world. At the core of the euro zone, Germany, where unemployment is actually lower than before the crisis, wage inflation is pressing up against 3 percent. Retail price inflation in the United Kingdom now exceeds 5 percent, despite very high unemployment. Reported inflation now exceeds 4.5 percent in China, 6 percent in Brazil and 8 percent in India.\n\nWe know from anecdotal soundings that American businesses, like businesses in other countries, are doing their utmost to offset with higher prices the surging costs of inputs such as fuel, other commodities and materials, and components, parts and processes sourced from abroad. My gut tells me that this will result in some unpleasant general price inflation numbers in the next few reporting periods, even though the trimmed-mean inflation rate we calculate at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas—based on the price movements of 178 personal consumption expenditure items—while rising, has over the past six months run at a sedate rate of 1.2 percent.\n\nGiven that we still have significant excess capacity of unemployed workers, extremely subdued wage growth, strong productivity growth and weak domestic demand, one might reasonably posit that the general inflationary pressures we are experiencing presently are transitory. Nonetheless, adding still more liquidity, or not withdrawing in a timely manner what we already provided in abundance, would do nothing to quell emerging inflationary pressures and might well compound them, proving doubly injurious to savers and the earnings of those who do have jobs.\n\nAnd there is always the risk that, having provided so much liquidity, we might unwittingly abet a resurrection of the tomfoolery so well-described by Bagehot. Some disturbing practices are beginning to rear their ugly heads again: We have seen a resurgence of “covenant-lite” loans, with some $24 billion issued in the first quarter versus $100 billion for all of 2007; private-equity firms are back in size and turning to leverage to pay dividends; credit-boom acronyms most thought would never return after the Panic, such as “payment-in-kind,” or PIK, and “toggle” notes, are prominent once again; traditionally unleveraged asset managers, such as insurance companies and pension funds, are turning to leverage and exotic asset classes to juice returns. These are all signs of the intoxicating effects of the ambrosia of inexpensive and plentiful money. Further spiking the punch bowl with accommodative monetary policy would do nothing to rein them in.\n\nIn summarizing the monetary side of the equation, I would argue that the Federal Open Market Committee did its job. In the face of great skepticism and cynicism, we persisted and pressed on with doing what central banks are supposed to do to pull an economy back from the brink. We reliquefied the financial markets: Liquidity is no longer scarce. Money is no longer dear; it is cheap. Job-creating businesses have the financial means to get on with putting Americans back to work. Continued accommodation presents significant risks. In my view, no amount of further accommodation by the Fed would be wise—either by prolonging or “tapering off” the volume of purchases of Treasuries past June, or adding another tranche of large-scale asset purchases. Indeed, it may well be that we should consider curtailing what remains of QE2.\n\nNow, we at the Fed are nearing a tipping point. Just as we pressed on in doing our duty through extraordinary, exigent measures, we must now discipline ourselves to just as persistently normalize our operations in a timely way.\n\nFiscal Policy\n\nAs for the fiscal side of the equation, you know the story. I have been harping on this for years. I spoke of the dangers of what in polite parlance might be called the fiscal incontinence of Congress when I addressed the Commonwealth Club of California in May of 2008.[7] Under both Republican and Democratic leadership, past Congresses have created a fiscal sinkhole that is so deep and so wide, it threatens to swallow up our prosperity and render our economy an abattoir. They have forsaken the most sacred responsibility they have to successor generations of Americans: Instead of passing the torch to our children, they have passed them the bill.\n\nPast Congresses have made promises they cannot keep. Now, the new Congress is embarking on a corrective course. This is just the beginning of what I expect to be a long, arduous exercise. Here I evoke St. Peter: Congress, “be serious and discipline yourselves.” You have no choice but to go through a painful and gut-wrenching rehabilitation and begin leading a sober life of living within your means. You must press on with getting your accounts in order, however politically unpleasant it may be to do so.\n\nThis will be a titanic struggle. Our Congress must find a way to align spending with income through taxation that (a) does not cut off the incipient economic recovery, (b) provides a credible path toward bringing their accounts—including the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security—to solvency and (c) respects the fact that in a globalized, cyber-ized world, those with the ability to create jobs may create them in places that offer more compelling fiscal and regulatory environments.\n\nThis last point is not unimportant. Permanent jobs are created by the private sector. Businesses, large and small, publicly or privately held, have a duty to earn a return on investment for their shareholders. In a globalized, cyber-ized world, they need not invest or expand their payrolls in the United States; they are free to go practically anywhere on the planet. This is the result of one of our greatest accomplishments as a nation: We won the Cold War. Before the demise of the Soviet Union and the death of Mao, we lived in a world of mutually assured destruction; today, we live in a world of mutually assured competition. This is what we spent an entire generation of blood and national treasure to achieve. Now, those with the power to levy taxes and direct spending must get with it and adjust to the new world as they seek to incentivize job creation through businesses that, thanks to monetary policy, now have the financial means to put Americans back to work right here at home.\n\nThere cannot be robust direct investment in the United States without confidence in the nation’s ability to reverse its budgetary death spiral, especially the inexorable accumulation of national debt and unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security. The need to break the back of that spiral is as dire now as was the need for Paul Volcker to break the back of inflation in the 1980s. Those who are leading the charge to restore fiscal sanity, be they Republican or Democrat, will no doubt recall the personal vitriol hurled at the then-Fed chairman; they should steel themselves against it. They should remember that, as a result of his steadfast determination to press on with exorcising inflation, Mr. Volcker is today among the most respected living Americans and widely considered an exemplar for public servants worldwide.\n\nGetting our fiscal house in order will not be an easy task. But there are worse alternatives. Resorting to protectionism or capital controls or sustained negative real interest rates or inflation, in lieu of real fiscal reform, would be pyrrhic solutions.[8] Corrupting the independence of the Fed would surely lead the nation to the same fate that befell Weimar Germany and Peron’s Argentina when their central banks took to monetizing debt. The nation cannot, must not, and, in my view, will not go down those sordid paths. Indeed, I sense we have turned the corner and are on the road to fiscal redemption, however bumpy it might be.\n\nMy German interlocutors asked why I am encouraged that we would now finally get on with the business of cleaning up our fiscal house. Central bankers are, after all, genetically programmed to be sourpusses; we are inherently wary of the capacity of politicians to be serious and discipline themselves.\n\nMy answer is admittedly emotional. I am the son of immigrants; my parents came to this country because it is the land of promise. Moreover, I am a naturalized Texan, and Texans are a persistent people who have always pressed on against the odds. The great historian of Texas, T.R. Fehrenbach, wrote that Texans understand that “men who exist get overrun by men who act.”[9] I believe deep in my heart that this is not unique to Texans—it is a quintessential American trait. I believe that the people of this great country will reward those members of Congress who act and will overrun those who exist only to encumber us with unsustainable debt and an imbalance of taxes and spending that threatens our prosperity rather than advances it. So, yes, I am hopeful that our elected leaders will get on the stick.\n\nBesides, I believe Winston Churchill had it right: “Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing … after they have exhausted all other possibilities.”\n\nThank you. In the best tradition of central bankers, I would be happy to avoid answering your questions.\n\n",

        "content": "March 7, 2011 Washington, D.C.\n\nWinston Churchill was in New York on Oct. 29, 1929, Black Thursday. Bernard Baruch took him to dinner that night with some 40 or so luminaries of finance—“friends and former millionaires,” Baruch called them. Churchill listened and, over the course of the evening and the next few days, took measure of the situation. He recorded his impression as follows: No one “could doubt that this financial disaster, huge as it is, cruel as it is to thousands, is only a passing episode in the march of a valiant…people who…are showing all nations much that they should attempt and much that they should avoid.” [1]\n\nThe historian Martin Gilbert later wrote that in the face of a fearful crisis, Churchill had seen the United States “at its most magnificent and its most tormented.” [2]\n\nMove the clock forward 82 years. We have no one on the world stage as eloquent as Churchill. But even the most prosaic observer might now be given to repeating the Last Lion’s observation: The financial disaster of 2008 and 2009 was huge. It was cruel not to thousands but to millions of Americans who lost their jobs and saw their savings and standard of living decimated. And yet, painful as it was—and remains for so many—it is proving to be a passing episode in the onward march of a valiant people.\n\nIn coping with the crisis and its aftermath, we have seen America at its most magnificent and its most tormented. We have shown others much that they should attempt and much that they should avoid.\n\nYou all know what transpired over the past few years, so let me give you an abridged version to set the stage of lessons learned and what I believe we now confront.\n\nDuring the recent Panic, the most important ingredient in the functioning of financial markets—trust in counterparties—imploded. The liquidity required to finance the business of America disappeared. Interbank lending evaporated. Risk premiums soared. The commercial paper market faltered. A hallmark money market fund “broke the buck.” Asset-backed security lending stopped cold. The entire spectrum of financing for businesses collapsed; the gears of the American economy went into reverse. Seemingly overnight, we were transformed from a grand vessel that had been sailing along on the tranquil sea of the Great Moderation into a battered wreck tossed about in a perfect storm threatening to dash us on the rocks of deflation, depression and ruin.\n\nEager to avoid the mistakes made by our predecessors during the 1930s, and led by an unassuming but determined chairman, the Federal Reserve created a panoply of programs to revive the key financial markets. In the face of widespread fear among businesses and the broader public, consternation among financial operators, and a great deal of breast beating by politicians threatening to compromise the independence that is so vital to operate a successful central bank, the Fed stepped into the breach. It did so in keeping with the ultimate duty of any central bank as lender of last resort: Drawing on emergency powers previously given us by the Congress, we addressed the exigent circumstances we faced by opening the floodgates to restore the credit markets and pull the economy back from the brink.\n\nThe long and short of it all was that the medicine applied by the Federal Reserve worked. Whereas, then there was no liquidity to finance our economy, now there is plenty: Money is cheap; banks and credit markets are flush; the stock market has soared. Financial wherewithal is widely available to businesses, public and private, that have the capacity to put the American people back to work.\n\nTo be sure, there are some, including me, who worry that the Fed ultimately may have taken out too much insurance against a double-dip recession and slippage into a deflationary spiral. There are some, including me, who argued against the last tranche of insurance we took out in committing to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries between last November and the end of this coming June as we were simultaneously purchasing additional Treasuries to make up for the roll off in our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. There was a strong feeling among those of my policy persuasion that we had already sufficiently refilled the tanks holding the financial fuel businesses needed to drive their job-creating machines. They felt that by being too accommodative, we might run the risk of planting the seeds that could germinate into renewed volatility, speculation and inflation, or give comfort to a government that for far too many congressional cycles has fallen down on the job by spending and borrowing and committing to unfunded programs with reckless abandon.\n\nBut whether you feel that the Federal Reserve has gotten it just right or gone a bit beyond the call of duty, it is hard for anyone to argue that the Fed did not succeed in pulling the financial markets back from the brink and has successfully reliquefied the economy, restoring the flow of the vital lifeblood of commerce.\n\nIn an interview published in the Dallas Morning News on Aug. 26, 2009, I said the Great Recession was over but that the healing process would take time before gathering momentum and resulting in meaningful job creation.[3] (It took the National Bureau of Economic Research, or NBER, 15 months to reach the same conclusion,[4] leading one of my most prominent colleagues on the FOMC to quip: “And the NBER is expected to soon tell us that Christmas last year occurred on Dec. 25!”) We now know the economy bottomed in the second quarter of 2009 and has slowly been gaining momentum since then. As is evident in the latest round of data, a recovery is well under way.\n\nBy acting with purpose, I believe the Federal Reserve, in the words of Winston Churchill, did its part to show the world “much that should be attempted and much that they should avoid.” We demonstrated that a lender of last resort must avoid being timid in the face of a crisis. We showed our nation, and others who look to us for leadership, that central banks must act deliberately and conduct their duties doggedly, however intense the criticism or political heat. But we also revealed the price of acts of omission—that an institution ultimately responsible for maintaining financial stability can ill afford to be lax in its duties as a regulator and supervisor of systemically critical financial institutions under its jurisdiction—a failure we have taken significant organizational steps to correct and are working hard to avoid letting happen again.\n\nI happen to believe one of the best outcomes of the crisis is that the Fed demonstrated the importance of a central bank keeping its word. We said we would close the numerous emergency programs we engineered once they had done their job. And we have thus far done so. Imagine that: A government agency that (a) does what it says it will do; (b) actually closes down programs once they have served their purpose; and (c) not only does not lose taxpayer money in the process but makes a profit for the Treasury from it.\n\nYet, though the recovery is gaining strength, we still have a long and arduous path ahead of us. I managed a grin when I read the giddy headline on the release last Thursday of the latest survey of the National Federation of Independent Business: In bold capital letters it proclaimed, “Whoo Hooo. Best Job Creation Number in 3 Years!!” [5] But I suppressed a more fulsome smile. The news is better; job creation is gathering momentum; the economy is moving in the right direction. But it is worrisomely clear that the task of putting millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans back to work will take an anguishing amount of time.\n\nI do not, however, feel that further monetary accommodation will speed the process. It might well retard job creation, should it give rise to inflationary expectations or, worse, imply that, having suffered the slings and arrows of popular and political contempt as we went about doing what we did to save the financial system, we have now been compromised and become a pliant accomplice to Congress’ and the executive branch’s fiscal misfeasance. I am wary of those risks. Indeed, as a voting member of the FOMC this year, I have made clear within the meeting room and in public speeches that, barring some frightful development, I will vote against any program that might seek to extend or enlarge the substantial monetary accommodation we already have provided, just as I argued against the $600 billion extension the voters on the Committee approved last November. And I remain doubtful enough as to its efficacy that if at any time between now and June, it should prove demonstrably counterproductive, I will vote to curtail or perhaps discontinue it. As I said, the liquidity tanks are full, if not brimming over. The Fed has done its job. What is needed now is for business to be incentivized to commit that liquidity to creating American jobs. This is the task of the fiscal authorities, not the Federal Reserve.\n\nHere, I see the America that Churchill described as being “at its most magnificent and its most tormented.”\n\nThe backbone of our economy, private business, is magnificently lean and fit. American business operators began to trim down and shape up their operating efficiency during the inflationary scare that threatened their profits running up to the summer of 2008. When the wheels came off the bus that fall and demand collapsed, they drove themselves to still greater efficiency to preserve their bottom lines or just to survive. The most expensive cost for most all businesses is labor. Over the past cycle, American businesses have learned to use the least amount of workers to drive the most amount of productivity. Today, our economy produces as much output as it did in 2007 before the onset of the crisis. But it uses over 7 million fewer workers to do so. From an economic standpoint, this efficiency is, indeed, a magnificent thing. And yet widespread unemployment is tormenting our society. The vexing question is: How will millions of Americans be put back to work in timely fashion?\n\nAll business operators, public or private, large or small, have a duty to their shareholders or their creditors to earn the highest return on investment possible. In a globalized economy, they can go anywhere on earth to do so. They can invest in China. Or India. Or Vietnam or Singapore or Brazil or Mexico or Africa. Or anywhere in an expanded, post-Cold War Europe. Nothing short of the poison of capital controls or protectionism can prevent them from doing so. Which raises the question: What must now be done to get businesses to invest in job creation here at home with the cheap and abundant money the Fed has made possible?\n\nThe obvious answer is that they must have confidence in the future of America. Businesses, like any other economic actor, will respond to immediate tax and regulatory incentives. But to make long-term investment decisions that create permanent, remunerative jobs they must have confidence in the long-term prospects of where they invest. In my judgment, it will be hard to secure that needed comfort until Congress makes clear it will refrain from the errant fiscal ways of the past, changes the way it taxes and spends and regulates, and places the nation demonstrably, and unalterably, on a path of fiscal rectitude.\n\nI was quoted in the Washington Post on Feb. 21 as saying that we had suffered for too long from “Lindsay Lohan” Congresses.[6] Like Ms. Lohan, the American Congress is a beautiful creation, blessed with enormous talent. But it has been waylaid by addiction—in the case of the Congress to spending and debt—and by a proclivity for shoplifting—in the case of the Congress to pocketing for their immediate gratification the economic future of our children and grandchildren and our grandchildren’s children.\n\nReasonable arguments can be made that fiscal policy must loosen during cyclical downturns to provide an economic environment conducive to growth. Some economic research even points to deficit spending as an essential ingredient for recovery when interest rates are near the so-called zero bound or the Fed has reached the limit of prudent monetary accommodation through other means. We certainly have put that theory to the test during the past two fiscal years, running deficits of $1.3 trillion in 2010 and an expected $1.65 trillion in 2011.\n\nWhat’s troubling about the fiscal situation, however, is the likelihood of persistent large yearly deficits long after the current recession is behind us. The same economic theory that prescribes deficits during recession prescribes surpluses during recovery to help meet the next economic challenge that might develop. If current deficits were exclusively due to cyclical phenomena, one would expect to see surpluses as we distance ourselves from the Great Recession we have just experienced. Instead, as far as the eyes of the analysts at the Office of Management and Budget can see, deficits will remain slightly above the 3 percent GDP threshold at which it is feared significant crowding-out of private sector economic activity begins to appear.[7] And other observers, under less optimistic assumptions, foresee significantly higher deficits in the years ahead.\n\nThe U.S. economy is afflicted with the pathology of structural deficits. This leaves the nation poorly positioned to weather the next recession or shock to come our way. I devoutly hope our next downturn won’t come for quite some time, but it surely will come eventually. Will we follow the lead of the biblical Joseph, storing fiscal grain during boom times in preparation for the lean times that will, inevitably, someday follow? Or will we take the opposite course and run larger-than-normal deficits every year, hindering our ability to respond when the current expansion ends or an unforeseen crisis occurs, thereby undermining the confidence needed by businesses to commit sustainable job-creating capital here at home?\n\nIt is important to note that institutionalized deficits are cruelest to future generations. What has made the United States an exceptional economic haven for investment and growth has been the certain knowledge that the successor generation would enjoy a better standard of living than the current one—that ever-expanding prosperity was built into the system. Encumbering future generations with debt dashes that promise. Instead of passing the torch of prosperity to the successor generation, the fiscal authorities have been passing them the bills. If our Congress continues to provide more in services than they are willing to collect in taxes, it is a mathematical certainty that the well-being of our progeny will suffer. Correcting this pernicious dynamic is imperative for assuring our economic future.\n\nIt is not the job of the Federal Reserve to conduct fiscal policy. It is not for me or any other Federal Reserve official to advise Congress on particular tax or expenditure choices. Yet the overall stance of fiscal policy is very much relevant to monetary policymakers. A large and growing government debt inevitably places pressure on the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates too low for too long, making it more difficult for the Fed to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment.\n\nThroughout history, feckless governments have dodged their fiscal responsibility by turning to their monetary authority to devalue the currency, monetize debt and inflate their way out of structural deficits. If we are to live up to Churchill’s charge to show the world what must be avoided, the world’s foremost central bank—keeper of the premier reserve currency and bulwark against its debasement—cannot, and must not, ever succumb to such pressure. It is thus best for everyone—future generations and the current one alike—that our fiscal leaders not go there. For such an action would precipitate a showdown that would be anything but “magnificent” to behold. Congress and the executive branch thus have no choice but to now suck it up, make some painful choices and get on with the business of putting our valiant nation on a more sustainable fiscal course. I, for one, am pleased to see that a dialogue toward this end has begun. Let us hope it results in meaningful action.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "February 8, 2011 Dallas, Texas\n\nIt is a great pleasure to speak to the Stemmons Corridor Business Association. I had the good fortune of knowing John Stemmons. He was one of my father-in-law’s closest friends, and his son, Johnny, who was taken from us way too early in life, was a cherished friend of mine. Mr. Stemmons looked like John Wayne and had the business acumen of Trammell Crow, who, as many of you know, was an early business partner of John’s. Without John Stemmons, Trammell Crow could never have developed the Trade Mart and all of his other innovative concepts that helped the Stemmons Corridor and Dallas become vital economic hubs.\n\nOnly John Stemmons would have had the foresight to donate 100 acres of recovered flood plain to the people of Texas, saving the state the cost of acquisition of a vital transportation artery and allowing him to develop this corridor into the great property it became. He was a giant of a man and an exemplary proponent of the free-market capitalism that made our city and our state and our country great.\n\nIt is somehow fitting that you asked me to speak here today, just two days after the 100th celebration of Ronald Reagan’s birthday. Old John Stemmons loved President Reagan. In 1984, the Republican convention was held here in Dallas. My father-in-law, Congressman Jim Collins, was also a good friend of the president. During the convention, Mr. Collins invited me to join Mr. Stemmons and a handful of their friends to visit with Mr. Reagan. The president was in remarkable form and, great raconteur that he was, told this story:\n\nPaddy McCoy, an elderly Irish farmer, received a letter from the Department for Works and Pensions stating that he was suspected of not paying his employees the statutory minimum wages and that an inspector would be sent to the farm.\n\nOn the appointed day, the inspector turned up. “Tell me about your staff,” he asked of Paddy.\n\n“Well,” said Paddy, “there is the farmhand. I pay him 240 a week and he has use of a free cottage.”\n\n“That’s good,” said the inspector.\n\n“Then there’s the housekeeper. She gets 190 a week, along with free board and lodging.”\n\n“That sounds fine,” said the inspector.\n\nPaddy went on. “There’s also the half-wit. He works a 16-hour day, does 90 percent of the work, nets about 25 pounds a week when all is said and done, but takes down a bottle of whiskey and, as a special treat, occasionally gets to sleep with my wife.”\n\n“That’s disgraceful, Paddy,” said the inspector. “I need to interview the half-wit.”\n\n“Well,” said Paddy, “you’re looking at him.”\n\nJohn Stemmons laughed so hard he cried. As rich and as prominent as he was, he identified with the Paddy McCoys of the world. He took delight in doing things as independently as possible; he was a great example of individual initiative in a world that has become increasingly dependent on government intervention and what we have come to know as an “inside the Beltway” mentality—a mentality that too often fails to grasp the essence and magic of Stemmons-like entrepreneurship that is the hallmark of American success.\n\nI am going to take advantage of this platform to remind you that the Federal Reserve System is uniquely structured to balance “inside the Beltway” influences with “outside the Beltway” thinking. The governors of the Fed in Washington are appointed by the president of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. The 12 bank presidents, like me, who operate the System in the field and also sit on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with the Fed governors, are not. Instead, we are selected by, and serve at the pleasure of, boards of directors drawn from the citizenry of our districts. Herb Kelleher, the founder of Southwest Airlines, is the current chairman of the Dallas Fed board, which includes eight others ranging from Renu Khator, the dynamic president of the University of Houston, to Joe Kim King, a goat rancher who is the CEO of Brady National Bank, a rural bank with $80 million in footings.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve Bank president, I play a dual role under the watchful eye of my board of directors. I am the CEO of a $100 billion Bank that lends and provides cash to and supervises and regulates local banks. We provide myriad services to the 27 million people who populate 360,000 square miles of Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico—27 million hardy citizens whose economic output exceeds the output of Australia and is only slightly less than that of India.\n\nOn the policy front, my job is to bring a Main Street perspective to the table. When I was asked by the Dallas Fed board six years ago to become president of the Bank, I met with Alan Greenspan. I asked the Chairman how I could best serve the System. His answer was crisp: “Just speak to the truth,” he said.\n\nJohn Stemmons would have given me the same advice.\n\nSo today, I will speak to the truth as I see it. As I always do, I speak only for myself and my colleagues at the Dallas Fed and not for anybody else on the FOMC or elsewhere in the System. I suspect this will immediately become clear.\n\nOnly a month ago, a new Congress was sworn in. New leadership took office in the Lower House, with the new speaker saying, “The American people have humbled us. … They have reminded us that everything is on loan from them.”[1] The Senate retained its leadership but underwent a sea change in its composition.\n\nAt the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House revealed significant staff changes while also announcing a new attitude toward the business community. The administration pledged to clear the underbrush that hampers businesses’ job creation by rooting out laws and regulations that, in the words of the president, “are just plain dumb,” and by vowing to now bring federal spending under control.[2]\n\nThe new Congress and the new staff in the White House have their work cut out for them. You cannot overstate the gravity of their duty on the economic front. Over the years, their predecessors—Republicans and Democrats together—have dug a fiscal sinkhole so deep and so wide that, left unrepaired, it will swallow up the economic future of our children, our grandchildren and their children. They must now engineer a way out of that frightful predicament without thwarting the nascent economic recovery.\n\nI have been outspoken about the limits of monetary policy as a salve for the nation’s fiscal pathology.[3] The Fed has done much, as I see it, to provide the bridge financing until the new Congress gets to work restructuring the tax and regulatory incentives American businesses need to confidently expand their payrolls and capital expenditures here at home.[4]\n\nThe Federal Reserve has held short-term interest rates to nil. We have expanded our balance sheet to unprecedented levels, with the effect of holding down mortgage rates and the rate of interest paid on Treasuries and the myriad financial instruments that are priced off of Treasuries, including corporate debt. After much debate—which included strong concern expressed by one member with a formal vote and others, like me, who did not have voting rights in 2010—the FOMC collectively decided in November to temporarily undertake a program to purchase U.S. Treasuries that, when added to previous policy initiatives, roughly means we will be purchasing the equivalent of all newly issued Treasury debt through June.\n\nBy this action, we have run the risk of being viewed as an accomplice to Congress’ fiscal nonfeasance. To avoid that perception, we must vigilantly protect the integrity of our delicate franchise. There are limits to what we can do on the monetary front to provide the bridge financing to fiscal sanity. The head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said it best recently while speaking in Germany: “Monetary policy responsibility cannot substitute for government irresponsibility.”[5]\n\nThe entire FOMC knows the history and the ruinous fate that is meted out to countries whose central banks take to regularly monetizing government debt. Barring some unexpected shock to the economy or financial system, I think we are pushing the envelope with the current round of Treasury purchases. I would be very wary of expanding our balance sheet further; indeed, given current economic and financial conditions, it is hard for me to envision a scenario where I would not use my voting position this year to formally dissent should the FOMC recommend another tranche of monetary accommodation. And I expect I will be at the forefront of the effort to trim back our Treasury holdings and tighten policy at the earliest sign that inflationary pressures are moving beyond the commodity markets and into the general price stream. I am a veteran of the Carter administration and know how easily prices can spin out of control and how cruelly markets can exact their revenge. I would not want to relive that experience.\n\nBut here is the essential fact I want to emphasize and have you think about today: The Fed could not monetize the debt if the debt were not being created by Congress in the first place.\n\nThe Fed does not create government debt; Congress does. Deficits and the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Social Security are not created by the Federal Reserve; they are the legacy of Congress. The Fed does not earmark taxpayer money for pet projects in local communities that taxpayers themselves would never countenance; only the Congress does that. The Congress and administration play the dominant role in creating the regulatory environment that incentivizes or discourages job creation.\n\nIt seems to me that those lawmakers who advocate “Ending the Fed” might better turn their considerable talents toward ending the fiscal debacle that has for too long run amuck within their own house.\n\nA look within the United States makes clear the overriding influence of fiscal and regulatory policy. Monetary policy is uniform across the 50 states; the base rate of interest paid on a business or consumer loan or a mortgage in Michigan, California, Ohio or New York is the same as that paid in Texas. Yet there is a reason that Michigan and California each lost more than 600,000 jobs over the past decade while Texas added more than 700,000 over the same period. There is a reason that the population of Ohio grew by only 183,000 residents over the past 10 years, while Texas grows by that number every five and a half months. There is a reason that with each passing census, the state of New York has been losing congressional seats and Texas has been adding them; a reason that, in the recent census, California failed to gain any while Texas gained four. There is a reason that, as documented in the Jan. 12 issue of the Wall Street Journal, college graduates—the best and brightest of the successor generation—are leaving New York and Cleveland and Detroit and moving to Austin, Texas.[6] There is a reason no state in the union houses more Fortune 500 headquarters than Texas. There is a reason for the disparate employment growth that has taken place in the 12 Federal Reserve districts over the past two decades, data that are documented in the graph at your place setting.\n\n\n\nThat reason has nothing to do with monetary policy. It has everything to do with the taxation and fiscal and regulatory policies of the states. The cost of capital does not explain the different economic performances of the states; the cost of doing business has everything to do with those differences. However well-meaning tax and regulatory initiatives in the laggard states may have been when they were conceived and levied, they have had unintended consequences that have led to economic underperformance and job destruction.\n\nSimilarly, the key to correcting the underperformance of the American economy and American job creation does not presently rest with the Federal Reserve. It is in the hands of those who make fiscal and regulatory policy.\n\nThe Fed has reduced the cost of business borrowing to the lowest levels in decades. It has seen to it that liquidity is widely available to banks and businesses. It has kept the economy from deflating and it has kept inflation under control. This has helped raise the economic tide. Recent data make clear that the risks of a double-dip recession and deflation have ebbed and that economic growth and job creation are beginning to flow. Yet the ships of job-creating investment remain, with some exceptions, tied to the docks—or worse, are choosing to sail for foreign ports where tax and regulatory conditions are more favorable, very much in the same way that Ohio, Michigan, New York and California businesses and workers have navigated to Texas.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls fell by 8.75 million jobs from their peak in January 2008 to their trough in February 2010. Estimates are that the population of Americans of working age increased by 4.4 million during the same period, creating a shortfall of over 13 million jobs. Since February 2010, the shortfall has only gotten worse: Although employers have added approximately 1 million new jobs, the working-age population has increased by an additional 1.7 million. All in all, we have approximately 6 million more people of working age than we did when the recession began—and a net loss of 7.7 million jobs. Divining policies that will encourage the private sector to increase hiring by enough to make up some of this lost ground is both an urgent and a daunting task.\n \nI don’t believe the Fed is constraining job creation. None of my business contacts, large or small, publicly held or private, are complaining about the cost of borrowing, the lack of liquidity or the availability of capital. Just this morning at 7:30, for example, the National Federation of Independent Business released results from a survey of 2,144 randomly selected small businesses. It said, “Ninety-two percent [of those surveyed] reported that all their credit needs were met or that they were not interested in borrowing.”[7]\n\nA recent Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index survey reports that about 80 percent of those who were reluctant to hire said they were afraid revenues wouldn’t increase enough to justify the expense.[8] The problem is not the availability of credit. The problem for businesses, small or large, is generating enough final sales at a profit; the need is for revenue that exceeds the expense of incurring that revenue.\n\nYou can’t have stronger sales if you don’t have stronger job creation. We will not have robust job creation until businesses are confident they can earn a good return on the investment they must make to add new workers. Employers live in a world in which they are free to invest their monies in expanding operations and hiring workers anywhere in the world, in any place they have the best opportunity to earn a superior return on investment. This is one of the legacies of the Reagan era—of having won the Cold War and having the majority of previously closed or dysfunctional governments choose prosperity as their goal rather than the economic suppression of their people. To achieve that prosperity, they need job-creating investment. To attract that investment, they provide incentives through tax and regulatory incentives and other means.\n\nWhereas before we lived in a world of mutually assured destruction, we now live in a world of mutually assured competition. We have no choice but to create the conditions that incent businesses that operate in the United States to compete using American workers. This requires rethinking by Congress—the sole body with the power to shape our nation’s taxes and spending and write regulatory laws to condition economic activity. Our lawmakers must do so in a manner that both stimulates the desire of businesses to put Americans back to work at the earliest opportunity and provides meaningful assurance that long-term fiscal imbalances they have wrought will be brought under control, assuring the long-term viability of the U.S. economy.\n\nBefore the recent mid-term election, most all of my business contacts claimed that taxes, regulatory burdens and the lack of understanding in Washington of what incentivizes private-sector job creation were inhibiting the expansion of their payrolls. They felt stymied by a Congress and an executive branch that have appeared to them to be unaware of, if not outright opposed to, what fires the entrepreneurial spirit. Many felt that opportunities for earning a better and more secure return on investment are larger elsewhere than here at home.\n\nPerhaps because I live so far outside the Beltway—among the Washington-skeptical, independent-minded people of the Eleventh Federal Reserve District—I was therefore not surprised by the outcome of the recent election. As I watched it unfold, I thought of one of the better books I had read in the summer of 1998, at the recommendation of a friend, the eminent historian David McCullough. It was titled Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World, written by Mark Kurlansky, and was considered by the New York Public Library to be “one of the 25 best books of the year.”[9]\n\nBuried in the middle of that remarkable little book is a wonderful description of the causes of the American Revolution. Kurlansky wrote that “Massachusetts radicals sought an economic, not a social, revolution. They were not thinking of the hungry masses. … They were thinking of the right of every man to be middle-class, to be an entrepreneur, to conduct commerce and make money.” Referring to John Adams, John Hancock and John Rowe—everyone seemed to be named John in New England in those days—he posited that the revolution “was about political freedom.” “But,” he went on, “in the minds of its most hard-line revolutionaries, the New England radicals, the central expression of that freedom was the ability to make their own decisions about their own economy.” He concluded that “all revolutions are to some degree about money,” reminding the reader that, reflecting upon France’s revolution, the Comte de Mirabeau said, “In the last analysis the people will judge the Revolution by this fact alone [sic] … Are they better off? Do they have more work? And is that work better paid?”[10]\n\nWe now have a new, younger and—in the sense depicted by Kurlansky—more radical Congress working alongside a president as they seek to craft policies more responsive to the message given by the electorate. The new Congress was elected to cast off the status quo of what many have come to feel is excessive encroachment upon the people’s freedom to make their own decisions about the economy. To do so successfully, this new, radical Congress and newly inspired president had better bear in mind Count Mirabeau’s analysis. The people of the United States will judge them not by their rhetoric, not by their declarations, proclamations and statements of intent, but by whether their policies result in a people who are better off, have more work and are better paid.\n\nThe leaders of our government cannot attempt to talk their way out of the problem like their predecessors did. Or string out needed remedies until after the next election. They must fix the problem now. If they fail to do so, then the election, for all its hoopla, will prove to have been nothing more than a case of putting old, rancid wine in new bottles.\n\nTheirs is not an easy task. We have all become used to the false comfort of having government coddle us, whether we are rich businesses receiving subsidies or poor citizens sustained by government largesse. The election tapped into a foreboding sense that the cost of that comfort now exceeds its benefits, as manifest in looming mega-deficits, deep if not unfathomable unfunded liabilities, egregious abuse of fiscal powers symbolized by earmarks, and other methods used by politicians to grease the skids of their reelection.\n\nTapping into that foreboding in the recent election was the easy part. Talk of reform is cheap. Enacting reform will be painful.\n\nA reader of Shakespeare will recall the dialogue between Glendower and Hotspur in Henry IV. Glendower claims, “I can call spirits from the vasty deep.” And Hotspur replies, “Why, so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do call for them?”[11]\n\nWe shall see if the new Congress will prove worthy of the power the American people have “loaned” them, and, together with the president, actually draw the spirits of fiscal reform and sanity from the “vasty deep” to at long last implement meaningful fiscal and regulatory policy that incentivizes private-sector job creation here at home while arresting the hemorrhaging of our Treasury. If they do, then more Americans will find work and be better off, better paid and freer to make their own decisions about the economy.\n\nIf they don’t, then woe to our children, their children and the American Dream.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying, “Have a nice day!” and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another central bank curmudgeon. I am professionally programmed to worry. Like John Stemmons, I am also a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even more dire test. To counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Great Depression, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: “You’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.”\nSecond: “You’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.”\nThird: “You’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country.”\nAnd fourth: “You’re right if you bet that [leaders] in business, labor and government are sane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.”\n\nThis became known as Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy, and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of us preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\n\nIt may seem like the stuff of our wildest dreams to imagine getting ourselves out of the current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. When put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion, no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more.\n\nThank you.",

        "content": "January 12, 2011 New York City\n\nI am delighted to speak here in the hallowed halls of the Harvard Club of New York City. I have been a member of this club for over 35 years. I love its sturdy facilities, its history, the trophies from Teddy Roosevelt’s African expedition of 1909–10 and … its mustiness.\n\nThe thing I prize most about this facility is that the rooms here are cheap. As I did last night, I always stay in what used to be called a “dorm room,” one of the little rooms smack in the middle of this old building. These rooms are sparsely furnished, with only a sink and a bed and the smallest imaginable armoire jammed into approximately 130 square feet. I like them because there are no better-priced rooms in New York City. And because they are stone quiet. They are the only hotel rooms I know of in the city where the occupants cannot hear the grinding noise of trash trucks … when trash is actually being collected.\n\nI am especially honored that both the Manhattan Institute and e21 are sponsoring this speech today.[1] Thank you, David [Malpass] for taking time out of your busy schedule to introduce me.\n\nThe Manhattan Institute and e21 are powerful proponents of the free-market capitalism that made our country the richest and the most successful democracy in the history of humankind. I took note of the institute’s claim on its website that it sponsors thinking “literally and figuratively outside the Beltway.” That’s a good thing. The Federal Reserve is structured to balance “inside the Beltway” influences with “outside the Beltway” thinking.

If they do, then more Americans will find work and be better off, better paid and freer to make their own decisions about the economy.\n\nIf they don’t, then woe to our children, their children and the American Dream.\n\nI am tempted to end this cheery talk by saying, “Have a nice day!” and walking off the stage. However, I would hate to leave this podium with your having concluded that I am just another central bank curmudgeon. I am professionally programmed to worry. But I am also a red-blooded American, as are all my colleagues at the Fed. I draw on the wisdom of Marcus Nadler, one of the great minds of the Federal Reserve from a period when our economy endured an even more dire test. To counter the intellectual paralysis and down-in-the-mouth pessimism that gripped the financial industry after the Great Depression, Nadler put forth four simple propositions:\n\nFirst, he said: “You’re right if you bet that the United States economy will continue to expand.”\nSecond: “You’re wrong if you bet that it is going to stand still or collapse.”\nThird: “You’re wrong if you bet that any one element in our society is going to ruin or wreck the country.”\nAnd fourth: “You’re right if you bet that [leaders] in business, labor and government are sane, reasonably well informed and decent people who can be counted on to find common ground among all their conflicting interests and work out a compromise solution to the big issues that confront them.”\n\nThis became known as Old Doc Nadler’s Remedy, and for my part, it is spot on. Every one of us preoccupied with what ails us should keep it in mind.\n\nIt may seem like the stuff of our wildest dreams to imagine getting ourselves out of our current nightmarish predicament. But I believe we can and we will. We are Americans. I believe deep in my soul that, when put to the test, Americans rise to the occasion no matter how great the challenge. We have done it time and again. We have no choice but to do it once more.\n\nI think I have said enough, if not too much. In the musty, time-honored tradition of central bankers, I am now happy to avoid answering any questions you might have.\n\nThank you.",
